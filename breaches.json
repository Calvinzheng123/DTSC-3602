    "summary": "It should take more than eight characters to bring a business to a halt. However, the relentless onslaught of password-based cyber attacks underscores the alarming ease with which cybercriminals can exploit vulnerable credentials to inflict damage. Password attacks take many forms: from phishing schemes that dupe employees into handing over their login information, to underground markets where bad actors can sell or purchase stolen credentials. Either way, having a valid password allows bad actors to do everything from stealing data to taking over critical business systems. In fact, nearly half (49%) of incidents cited in Verizon's 2023 Data Breach Investigations Report involved compromised passwords. The password attacks of 2023 involved the following high-profile brands: Best known for its genetic testing and ancestry services, 23andMe disclosed that a hacker was offering to sell names, location, and other data that could cover half of its 14 million users. This incident was attributed to credential stuffing, where guessing login credentials or using credentials stolen from other sources are used to gain unauthorized access. It may be known as a provider of antivirus protection, but the vendor found its own security compromised following the discovery of a credential stuffing attack. The incident involved the company's own Norton Lifelock Password Manager. Norton said the incident involved close to a million customers, of whom 6,500 had data compromised . In late August, the online charity that helps divert reusable goods from landfills sent out an urgent request asking members to change their passwords . In an online form, a hacker claimed the breach included up to seven million accounts, with details such as user IDs, e-mails and hashed passwords. The organization said the attack may have begun years ago when a server was exposed, adding that changing credentials was particularly important if members are using the same ones for other services. While the exact steps of a security incident response will vary somewhat depending on the extent of a breach, some of the best practices to minimize the damage include: 1. Issuing a 'Reset All Passwords' directive Blocking access to cybercriminals will prevent further repercussions from the initial breach. This means sending clear communication to all employees and customers to immediately change their passwords . Businesses can simplify this process for their employees through a self-service password reset tool to minimize calls to the helpdesk. 2. Having an incident response team If you haven't already walked through the steps to handling a cybersecurity incident, you'll need to bring the appropriate stakeholders together to develop an action plan. This usually includes the IT department, legal counsel, and even marketing communications teams who'll inform affected parties. You may also need to bring on third-party help to conduct digital forensics to understand the full scope of the attack's impact. 3. Notifying those whose personal information has been compromised Effective data breach disclosure needs to be comprehensive and clear, with next-best steps included. Make sure you've compiled answers to the most anticipated questions and provide simple mechanisms where people can contact you for more details. Advise on any recommendations to safeguard information, such as the password reset directive described above. Defending your business against password attacks isn't a matter of reinventing the wheel. Many businesses simply need to apply some of the standard protective measures. This starts with education. Employees should be regularly trained in password security and informed about the dangers of using the same passwords across multiple services. Given that cybercriminals may be buying or selling lists of previously compromised credentials, businesses should also build routine monitoring to ensure they're not at risk. Tools like Specops Password Policy , which continuously scans your Active Directory for compromised passwords, allows businesses to move from reactive to proactive password security. Passwords provide a key to some of the most valuable information and systems in the world. With the right technologies and procedures, businesses can improve their ability to ensure those keys don't fall into the wrong hands. Sponsored and written by Specops Software .",

In data breach notifications filed with the Office of Maine's Attorney General, Coinbase said, \"a small number of individuals, performing services for Coinbase at our overseas retail support locations, improperly accessed customer information.\" While the exposed data did not include the impacted people's passwords, seed phrases, private keys, or other information that could be used to access their funds or accounts, it did include a combination of personal identifiers such as name, date of birth, last four digits of social security numbers, masked bank account numbers and some bank account identifiers, addresses, phone number, and email address. Depending on the affected customer, the stolen information can also contain images of government identification information (e.g., driver's license number, passport number, national identity card number) and account information (including transaction history, balance, transfers, account opening date). \"Attackers seek out this information because they want to conduct social engineering attacks, using this information to appear credible to try and convince victims to move their funds,\" Coinbase warned. The disclosure comes after many have voiced their concern that this incident could lead to serious consequences, including physical harm, after cybercriminals gain access to the account balances and addresses of impacted Coinbase customers affected by this data breach. On Thursday, Coinbase disclosed the data breach in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that the threat actors behind this attack obtained customer data of up to 1% of Coinbase's customer base with the help of support staff or contractors outside the United States. The attackers also sent an email on May 11 attempting to extort a $20 million ransom payment in exchange for not releasing the stolen information online. However, the crypto exchange said it would not pay the ransom but would establish a $20 million reward fund for tips that could help find the attackers who coordinated this attack and bring them to justice. While Coinbase is still assessing the breach's financial impact and the number of customers who were tricked into sending funds to the attackers in follow-up social engineering attacks is still unknown, the company said the resulting expenses will likely be \"within the range of approximately $180 million to $400 million\" for remediation and customer refunds. \"Coinbase will voluntarily reimburse retail customers who mistakenly sent funds to the scammer as a direct result of this incident prior to the date of this post, following a review to confirm the facts,\" the company said.

    "summary": "Ascension, one of the largest private healthcare systems in the United States, has revealed that the personal and healthcare information of over 430,000 patients was exposed in a data breach disclosed last month. As Ascension revealed in breach notification letters sent to affected individuals in April, their information was stolen in a data theft attack that impacted a former business partner in December. Depending on the impacted patient, the attackers could access personal health information related to inpatient visits, including the physician's name, admission and discharge dates, diagnosis and billing codes, medical record number, and insurance company name. They could also gain access to personal information, including name, address, phone number(s), email address, date of birth, race, gender, and Social Security numbers (SSNs). \"On December 5, 2024, we learned that Ascension patient information may have been involved in a potential security incident. We immediately initiated an investigation to determine whether and how a security incident occurred,\" Ascension said . \"Our investigation determined on January 21, 2025, that Ascension inadvertently disclosed information to a former business partner, and some of this information was likely stolen from them due to a vulnerability in third-party software used by the former business partner.\" While Ascension didn't reveal the total number of affected individuals at the time, an April 29 filing said that the incident impacted 114,692 individuals in Texas, and the company also told Massachusetts' Office of the Attorney General that 96 residents had their medical records and SSNs exposed in the incident. However, the healthcare giant also disclosed in an April 28 filing with the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) that wasn't published until today that the data breach affected 437,329 individuals. ​Ascension offers two years of free identity monitoring services to those impacted by this incident, including credit monitoring, fraud consultation, and identity theft restoration. Although Ascension didn't share any details regarding the breach affecting its former business partner, the timeline of the breach implies that the attack was part of widespread Clop ransomware data theft attacks that exploited a zero-day flaw in Cleo secure file transfer software. Last year, Ascension notified almost 5.6 million patients and employees that their personal, financial, insurance, and health information had been stolen in a May 2024 Black Basta ransomware attack . After the incident, the healthcare organization revealed that the ransomware breach resulted from an employee downloading a malicious file onto a company device. Following the May 2024 attack, employees were forced to keep track of procedures and medications on paper, as patients' electronic records couldn't be accessed. Ascension also had to pause some non-emergent elective procedures, tests, and appointments and redirect emergency medical services to unaffected healthcare units to prevent triage delays.

The Hot Topic fast-fashion chain has over 10,000 employees in more than 630 store locations across the U.S. and Canada, the company's headquarters, and two distribution centers. In credential stuffing attacks, cybercriminals use automated tools to trigger millions of login attempts using a list of username and password pairs. The technique is particularly effective when users reuse the same login information across multiple platforms. Breach notification letters sent to potentially impacted customers this week reveal that attackers targeted Hot Topic Rewards accounts in automated attacks using login information obtained from an unknown source. \"We determined that unauthorized parties launched automated attacks against our website and mobile application on November 18-19 and November 25, 2023, using valid account credentials (e.g., email addresses and passwords) obtained from an unknown third-party source,\" Hot Topic said. \"Based on our investigation to date, we are not able to determine which, if any, accounts were accessed by unauthorized third parties as opposed to legitimate customer logins during the relevant time periods.\" Sensitive information that could've been exposed on compromised accounts includes affected customers' names, email addresses, order histories, phone numbers, months and days of birth, and mailing addresses. Hot Topic says that breached Rewards accounts would have only allowed the attackers to access partial payment data, specifically the last four digits of the card number. The retail chain worked with external cybersecurity experts after the November attacks to deploy bot protection software that should block such attacks in the future. Hot Topic will also require customers who receive the data breach notifications to set a new password to prevent other threat actors from hijacking their Hot Topic web or mobile accounts.

    "summary": "Ticketmaster has started to notify customers who were impacted by a data breach after hackers stole the company's Snowflake database, containing the data of millions of people. \"Ticketmaster recently discovered that an unauthorized third party obtained information from a cloud database hosted by a third-party data services provider,\" reads a data breach notification shared with the Office of the Maine Attorney General. \"Based on our investigation, we determined that the unauthorized activity occurred between April 2, 2024, and May 18, 2024. On May 23, 2024, we determined that some of your personal information may have been affected by the incident. We have not seen any additional unauthorized activity in the cloud database since we began our investigation.\" Ticketmaster says that the breach exposed customers' names, basic contact information, and \"<extra>\" information, which is different depending on the user. The company recommends customers \"remain vigilant\" against identity theft and fraud and has offered one year of free identity monitoring to track their credit history. While Ticketmaster lazily said the breach only impacted more than 1000 people (\">1000\"), it actually impacted millions of customers worldwide and exposed what many would consider much more sensitive information. Last month, a threat actor known as ShinyHunters began selling stolen data from Live Nation/Ticketmaster, claiming it contained the personal information and credit card information of 560 million users. The threat actors used compromised Ticketmaster credentials that did not have multi-factor authentication enabled to steal the data from their Snowflake account. Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehousing company used by the enterprise to store databases, process data, and perform analytics. ShinyHunters began selling the data on May 28 on a well-known hacking forum for $500,000. The threat actor claimed that the data was 1.3TB and contained information for 560 million customers, ticket sales, event information, customer fraud, and partial credit card information. Samples of the data seen by BleepingComputer contained more than just \"basic contact information,\" including full names, email addresses, phone numbers, addresses, hashed credit card details, and payment amounts. After remaining silent for days, Ticketmaster eventually confirmed the breach on May 31, in a Friday evening SEC filing, stating that they did not believe the breach would have a material impact on their company. Ticketmaster's breach is one of many recent data theft attacks linked to the Snowflake database platform. A joint investigation by SnowFlake, Mandiant, and CrowdStrike revealed that a threat actor, tracked as UNC5537, used compromised customer credentials to target at least 165 organizations that had not configured multi-factor authentication protection on their accounts. To breach Snowflake accounts, the threat actor used credentials stolen by information-stealing malware infections dating back to 2020. Recent breaches linked to these attacks include Neiman Marcus , Santander , Ticketmaster , QuoteWizard/LendingTree , Advance Auto Parts , Los Angeles Unified , and Pure Storage .

    "summary": "Ticketmaster has started to notify customers who were impacted by a data breach after hackers stole the company's Snowflake database, containing the data of millions of people. \"Ticketmaster recently discovered that an unauthorized third party obtained information from a cloud database hosted by a third-party data services provider,\" reads a data breach notification shared with the Office of the Maine Attorney General. \"Based on our investigation, we determined that the unauthorized activity occurred between April 2, 2024, and May 18, 2024. On May 23, 2024, we determined that some of your personal information may have been affected by the incident. We have not seen any additional unauthorized activity in the cloud database since we began our investigation.\" Ticketmaster says that the breach exposed customers' names, basic contact information, and \"<extra>\" information, which is different depending on the user. The company recommends customers \"remain vigilant\" against identity theft and fraud and has offered one year of free identity monitoring to track their credit history. While Ticketmaster lazily said the breach only impacted more than 1000 people (\">1000\"), it actually impacted millions of customers worldwide and exposed what many would consider much more sensitive information. Last month, a threat actor known as ShinyHunters began selling stolen data from Live Nation/Ticketmaster, claiming it contained the personal information and credit card information of 560 million users. The threat actors used compromised Ticketmaster credentials that did not have multi-factor authentication enabled to steal the data from their Snowflake account. Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehousing company used by the enterprise to store databases, process data, and perform analytics. ShinyHunters began selling the data on May 28 on a well-known hacking forum for $500,000. The threat actor claimed that the data was 1.3TB and contained information for 560 million customers, ticket sales, event information, customer fraud, and partial credit card information. Samples of the data seen by BleepingComputer contained more than just \"basic contact information,\" including full names, email addresses, phone numbers, addresses, hashed credit card details, and payment amounts. After remaining silent for days, Ticketmaster eventually confirmed the breach on May 31, in a Friday evening SEC filing, stating that they did not believe the breach would have a material impact on their company. Ticketmaster's breach is one of many recent data theft attacks linked to the Snowflake database platform. A joint investigation by SnowFlake, Mandiant, and CrowdStrike revealed that a threat actor, tracked as UNC5537, used compromised customer credentials to target at least 165 organizations that had not configured multi-factor authentication protection on their accounts. To breach Snowflake accounts, the threat actor used credentials stolen by information-stealing malware infections dating back to 2020. Recent breaches linked to these attacks include Neiman Marcus , Santander , Ticketmaster , QuoteWizard/LendingTree , Advance Auto Parts , Los Angeles Unified , and Pure Storage .

    "summary": "DoorDash has disclosed a data breach that hit the food delivery platform this October. Beginning yesterday evening, DoorDash, which serves millions of customers across the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, started emailing those impacted by the newly discovered security incident. \"On October 25, 2025, our team identified a cybersecurity incident that involved an unauthorized third party gaining access to and taking certain user contact information, which varied by individual,\" states the email notification from DoorDash. The information may have included: \"Our investigation has since confirmed that your personal information was affected.\" The incident has been traced to a DoorDash employee falling victim to a social engineering scam. Upon becoming aware, the company's incident response team shut down the unauthorized party's access, started an investigation, and referred the matter to law enforcement. The disclosure does not specify how many users were affected, though the company says the incident impacted a mix of consumers, Dashers, and merchants. This marks the third notable security incident suffered by the delivery giant. In 2019, a data breach at DoorDash had exposed the information of roughly 5 million customers , Dashers and merchants to an unauthorized party. In August 2022, the company encountered another data breach from threat actors who had also attacked Twilio that year. What's interesting is that a French translation of the notice is appended to these emails: At this time, it appears that the emails primarily went to DoorDash Canada users (including myself). However, an undated security advisory posted on DoorDash's website suggests the incident may extend beyond Canada. It has references to U.S.-specific data types, like Social Security Numbers (SSNs), which DoorDash says were not accessed (Canadian counterpart would be Social Insurance Numbers (SINs) ). BleepingComputer has approached the DoorDash press team to clarify whether the breach also affects users in the U.S. or other regions where the company operates. Some users on social media have rebuked DoorDash, questioning the company's handling of the incident and the timing of the notifications. \"I'm sorry - if this isn't sensitive information, what is? Don't downplay this just because they didn't get credit card or password information. It's gone deaf,\" posted Chris from Toronto. Cybersecurity professional Kostas T. also reacted to the email's phrasing, expressing that the statement \"no sensitive information was accessed\" conflicted with the personal information that the company acknowledged was accessed. \"DoorDash took 19 whole days to notify me of a data breach that has leaked my personal information. Thankfully I used a fake name and forwarded email address for my account, but my real phone number and physical address have been leaked,\" wrote X user Ohqay. \"This is incredibly unprofessional, dangerous, and potentially illegal behaviour from DoorDash... This process violates Canadian data breach law. I'll be filing a case against DoorDash in provincial small claims court and making a complaint to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada.\" Users should be wary of unsolicited communications or targeted phishing emails appearing to originate from DoorDash. DoorDash warns that you should avoid clicking on links or attachments within suspicious emails, and to refrain from providing any personal information to unfamiliar websites. \"We have already taken steps to respond to the incident, including deploying enhancements to our security systems, implementing additional training for our employees, bringing in a leading cybersecurity forensic firm to assist in our investigation of this issue, and notifying law enforcement for ongoing investigation,\" states the company. DoorDash users with questions related to the incident can further call the toll-free number +1-833-918-8030 and cite reference code: B155060.

    "summary": "DoorDash has disclosed a data breach that hit the food delivery platform this October. Beginning yesterday evening, DoorDash, which serves millions of customers across the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, started emailing those impacted by the newly discovered security incident. \"On October 25, 2025, our team identified a cybersecurity incident that involved an unauthorized third party gaining access to and taking certain user contact information, which varied by individual,\" states the email notification from DoorDash. The information may have included: \"Our investigation has since confirmed that your personal information was affected.\" The incident has been traced to a DoorDash employee falling victim to a social engineering scam. Upon becoming aware, the company's incident response team shut down the unauthorized party's access, started an investigation, and referred the matter to law enforcement. The disclosure does not specify how many users were affected, though the company says the incident impacted a mix of consumers, Dashers, and merchants. This marks the third notable security incident suffered by the delivery giant. In 2019, a data breach at DoorDash had exposed the information of roughly 5 million customers , Dashers and merchants to an unauthorized party. In August 2022, the company encountered another data breach from threat actors who had also attacked Twilio that year. What's interesting is that a French translation of the notice is appended to these emails: At this time, it appears that the emails primarily went to DoorDash Canada users (including myself). However, an undated security advisory posted on DoorDash's website suggests the incident may extend beyond Canada. It has references to U.S.-specific data types, like Social Security Numbers (SSNs), which DoorDash says were not accessed (Canadian counterpart would be Social Insurance Numbers (SINs) ). BleepingComputer has approached the DoorDash press team to clarify whether the breach also affects users in the U.S. or other regions where the company operates. Some users on social media have rebuked DoorDash, questioning the company's handling of the incident and the timing of the notifications. \"I'm sorry - if this isn't sensitive information, what is? Don't downplay this just because they didn't get credit card or password information. It's gone deaf,\" posted Chris from Toronto. Cybersecurity professional Kostas T. also reacted to the email's phrasing, expressing that the statement \"no sensitive information was accessed\" conflicted with the personal information that the company acknowledged was accessed. \"DoorDash took 19 whole days to notify me of a data breach that has leaked my personal information. Thankfully I used a fake name and forwarded email address for my account, but my real phone number and physical address have been leaked,\" wrote X user Ohqay. \"This is incredibly unprofessional, dangerous, and potentially illegal behaviour from DoorDash... This process violates Canadian data breach law. I'll be filing a case against DoorDash in provincial small claims court and making a complaint to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada.\" Users should be wary of unsolicited communications or targeted phishing emails appearing to originate from DoorDash. DoorDash warns that you should avoid clicking on links or attachments within suspicious emails, and to refrain from providing any personal information to unfamiliar websites. \"We have already taken steps to respond to the incident, including deploying enhancements to our security systems, implementing additional training for our employees, bringing in a leading cybersecurity forensic firm to assist in our investigation of this issue, and notifying law enforcement for ongoing investigation,\" states the company. DoorDash users with questions related to the incident can further call the toll-free number +1-833-918-8030 and cite reference code: B155060. BleepingComputer awaits DoorDash's response on the exact scope of the incident.

It is specifically clarified that current evidence does not indicate that casino members (Sands Rewards Club) have been impacted by the incident. The company says that MBS customers who have had their personal data exposed to the attackers will be informed of the breach and impact in indivifual notifications. After discovering the incident, MBS reported it to authorities in Singapore and other relevant countries. While the scope of the attack has not been clarified publicly, the intrusion could be related to a ransomawre attack. Threat actors are often stealing data from company networks and then try to extort money from the victim.

PandaBuy allows international users to purchase products from various e-commerce platforms in China, including Tmall, Taobao, and JD.com. Yesterday, a threat actor named 'Sanggiero' claimed a breach on PandaBuy, allegedly performed together with another threat actor called 'IntelBoker.' \"The data was stolen by exploiting several critical vulnerabilities in the platform's API and other bugs were identified allowing access to the internal service of the website,\" the threat actor said. \"The data contained 3M+ unique UserId, First Name, Last Name, Phone Numbers, Emails, Login IP, Orders_Data, Orders_Id, Home_address, Zip, Country, and so on.\" According to data breach aggregation service Have I Been Pwned (HIBP), 1,348,407 PandaBuy accounts have been exposed in the breach. The details of PandaBuy shoppers were leaked on a forum and can be obtained by any registered members in exchange for a symbolic payment in cryptocurrency. To prove to unregistered members that the information is valid, the threat actor provides a small sample containing email addresses, customer names, order numbers and details, shipping addresses, transaction dates and times, and payment IDs. Troy Hunt, the creator of HIBP, tested password reset requests using the leaked addresses and confirmed that at least 1.3 million email addresses are valid and come from PandaBuy. The rest are made-up and duplicate addresses, so the \"3 million\" figure was inflated by the threat actors. PandaBuy has not made any statements about the data breach. According to some reports , the company is trying to conceal the incident by censoring user posts on Discord and Reddit . A company representative with an administrator role on the Discord channel said that a security incident had occurred in the past and that the leaked data was old and that the platform's security team had responded to the issue promptly. If you have an account on PandaBuy, it is strongly recommended to reset your password. Also, remain vigilant for scam attempts and treat unsolicited communications with suspicion. PandaBuy user data has been added to HIBP and subscribers to the service should have received an email informing them of the leak.

    "summary": "Data belonging to more than 1.3 million customers of the PandaBuy online shopping platform has been leaked, allegedly after two threat actors exploited multiple vulnerabilities to breach systems. PandaBuy allows international users to purchase products from various e-commerce platforms in China, including Tmall, Taobao, and JD.com. Yesterday, a threat actor named 'Sanggiero' claimed a breach on PandaBuy, allegedly performed together with another threat actor called 'IntelBoker.' \"The data was stolen by exploiting several critical vulnerabilities in the platform's API and other bugs were identified allowing access to the internal service of the website,\" the threat actor said. \"The data contained 3M+ unique UserId, First Name, Last Name, Phone Numbers, Emails, Login IP, Orders_Data, Orders_Id, Home_address, Zip, Country, and so on.\" According to data breach aggregation service Have I Been Pwned (HIBP), 1,348,407 PandaBuy accounts have been exposed in the breach. The details of PandaBuy shoppers were leaked on a forum and can be obtained by any registered members in exchange for a symbolic payment in cryptocurrency. To prove to unregistered members that the information is valid, the threat actor provides a small sample containing email addresses, customer names, order numbers and details, shipping addresses, transaction dates and times, and payment IDs. Troy Hunt, the creator of HIBP, tested password reset requests using the leaked addresses and confirmed that at least 1.3 million email addresses are valid and come from PandaBuy. The rest are made-up and duplicate addresses, so the \"3 million\" figure was inflated by the threat actors. PandaBuy has not made any statements about the data breach. According to some reports , the company is trying to conceal the incident by censoring user posts on Discord and Reddit . A company representative with an administrator role on the Discord channel said that a security incident had occurred in the past and that the leaked data was old and that the platform's security team had responded to the issue promptly. If you have an account on PandaBuy, it is strongly recommended to reset your password. Also, remain vigilant for scam attempts and treat unsolicited communications with suspicion. PandaBuy user data has been added to HIBP and subscribers to the service should have received an email informing them of the leak. It's budget season!

American car rental giant Avis notified customers that unknown attackers breached one of its business applications last month and stole some of their personal information. According to data breach notification letters sent to impacted customers on Wednesday and filed with California's Office of the Attorney General, the company took action to stop the unauthorized access, launched an investigation with the help of external cybersecurity experts, and reported the incident to relevant authorities after learning of the breach on August 5. This investigation revealed that the attacker accessed its business applications from August 3 until August 6, when the company evicted the malicious actor from its systems and blocked its access. On August 14, it also found that the attacker stole some customers' personal information, including their names and other undisclosed sensitive data. As revealed in a separate filing with Maine's attorney general , the attackers stole the personal information of 299,006 Avis customers in the breach. \"We continue to further enhance our cybersecurity practices and defenses and are sending individual notifications to approximately 300,000 U.S. customers (less than 1% of our customer base) whose personal information was affected with offers of complimentary credit and identity monitoring services,\" an Avis spokesperson told BleepingComputer. Since the breach, Avis says it has worked with outside experts to strengthen security measures for the affected application and implemented additional safeguards across its systems. The company added that it's actively reviewing security monitoring and controls to bolster security defenses and warned customers of identity theft and fraud risks following the data breach. \"It is always a good idea to remain vigilant against threats of identity theft or fraud,\" Avis told those whose personal information was stolen in the incident. \"You can do this by regularly reviewing and monitoring your account statements and credit history for any signs of unauthorized transactions or activity. You can contact the credit reporting agencies if you suspect any unauthorized activity.\" The car rental company also offered those affected a free one-year membership to Equifax's credit monitoring service, which assists with identity theft detection and resolution.

A filing with the Office of Maine's Attorney General revealed that the incident impacted 538,959 individuals. The attackers gained access to the affected people's names, Social Security numbers, and other personal identifiers. \"On or about December 24, 2023, the Ohio Lottery detected unauthorized access to our internal office network as a result of a cybersecurity incident that resulted in the exposure of the data we maintain.

Still, it provides free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services to all potentially impacted individuals \"out of an abundance of caution.\" While the Ohio Lottery didn't reveal the nature of the incident, which affected mobile and prize-cashing operations, the DragonForce ransomware gang claimed the attack days later. The threat actors claimed they encrypted devices and stole documents belonging to both Ohio Lottery customers and employees.

    "summary": "News broke today about \"one of the largest data breaches in history,\" sparking wide media coverage filled with warnings and fear-mongering. However, it appears to just be a compilation of previously leaked credentials stolen by infostealers, exposed in data breaches, and via credential stuffing attacks. To be clear, this is not a new data breach, or a breach at all, and the websites involved were not recently compromised to steal these credentials. Instead, these stolen credentials were likely circulating for some time, if not for years. It was then collected by a cybersecurity firm, researchers, or threat actors and repackaged into a database that was exposed on the Internet. Cybernews, which discovered the briefly exposed datasets of compiled credentials, stated it was stored in a format commonly associated with infostealer malware, though they did not share samples An infostealer is malware that attempts to steal credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, and other data from an infected device. Over the years, infostealers have become a massive problem, leading to breaches worldwide. These types of malware impact both Windows and Macs, and when executed, will gather all the credentials it can find stored on a device and save them in what is called a \"log.\" An infostealer log is generally an archive containing numerous text files and other stolen data. The text files contain lists of credentials stolen from browsers, files, and other applications. Stolen credentials are usually saved one per line in the following format: Sometimes, the delimiter between each component is changed to a comma, semicolon, or dash. For example, the following is how an infostealer will save credentials stolen from a device to a log: If someone is infected with an infostealer and has a thousand credentials saved in their browser, the infostealer will steal them all and store them in the log. These logs are then uploaded to the threat actor, where the credentials can be used for further attacks or sold on cybercrime marketplaces. The infostealer problem has gotten so bad and pervasive that compromised credentials have become one of the most common ways for threat actors to breach networks. We have a webinar next month titled \" Stolen credentials: The New Front Door to Your Network \" that focuses on infostealers, compromised credentials, and how organizations can protect themselves. This problem has also led law enforcement worldwide to actively crack down on these cybercrime operations in recent actions, such as \" Operation Secure \" and the disruption of LummaStealer . As infostealers have become so abundant and commonly used, threat actors release massive compilations for free on Telegram, Pastebin, and Discord to gain reputation among the cybercrime community or as teasers to paid offerings. To see how many passwords are given away for free, the single 1,261.4 MB file in the image above contained over 64,000 credential pairs. There are thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of similarly leaked archives being shared online, resulting in billions of credentials records released for free. Many of these free archives were likely compiled into massive data sets that were briefly exposed and seen by Cybernews. Similar credential collections were released in the past, such as the RockYou2024 leak , with over 9 billion records, and \" Colection #1 ,\" which contained over 22 million unique passwords. Despite the buzz, there's no evidence this compilation contains new or previously unseen data So, now that you know there was a massive leak of credentials likely stolen through infostealers, data breaches, and credential-stuffing attacks, you may be wondering what you should do. The most important step is to adopt and maintain good cybersecurity habits you should already be following. If you're concerned that an infostealer might be present on your computer, scan your device with a trusted antivirus program before changing any passwords. Otherwise, newly entered credentials could be stolen as well. Once you're confident your system is clean, focus on improving your password hygiene. That means using a unique, strong password for every site you use, and relying on a password manager to keep them organized and secure. However, even unique passwords won't help you stay protected if you are hacked, fall for a phishing attack, or install malware. Therefore, it is crucial that you also use two-factor authentication (2FA) along with an authentication app, like Microsoft Authenticator , Google Authenticator , or Authy , to manage your 2FA codes. Some password managers, like Bitwarden and 1Password, also include authentication functionality, allowing you to use one application for both. With 2FA enabled, even if a password at a site is compromised, threat actors cannot access the account without your 2FA code. As a general rule, you should avoid using SMS texts to receive 2FA codes, as threat actors can conduct SIM-swapping attacks to hijack your phone number and obtain them. As for this leak, with this many credentials leaked, there is a chance one of the readers of this article will be listed in the compilation. However, don't panic and stress about it, running around changing all your passwords. Instead, take this opportunity to improve your cybersecurity habits. To check if your credentials have appeared in known breaches, consider using services like Have I Been Pwned . And if you use the same password across multiple sites, now is the time to switch to unique ones. That way, leaks like this become far less dangerous to you. Update 6/20/25 10:08 PM EST: Article updated to clarify that this was multiple datasets found rather than a single database and to remove \"mother of all breaches,\" as that was to describe the other compilation discovered in 2024.

    "summary": "News broke today about \"one of the largest data breaches in history,\" sparking wide media coverage filled with warnings and fear-mongering. However, it appears to just be a compilation of previously leaked credentials stolen by infostealers, exposed in data breaches, and via credential stuffing attacks. To be clear, this is not a new data breach, or a breach at all, and the websites involved were not recently compromised to steal these credentials. Instead, these stolen credentials were likely circulating for some time, if not for years. It was then collected by a cybersecurity firm, researchers, or threat actors and repackaged into a database that was exposed on the Internet. Cybernews, which discovered the briefly exposed datasets of compiled credentials, stated it was stored in a format commonly associated with infostealer malware, though they did not share samples An infostealer is malware that attempts to steal credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, and other data from an infected device. Over the years, infostealers have become a massive problem, leading to breaches worldwide. These types of malware impact both Windows and Macs, and when executed, will gather all the credentials it can find stored on a device and save them in what is called a \"log.\" An infostealer log is generally an archive containing numerous text files and other stolen data. The text files contain lists of credentials stolen from browsers, files, and other applications. Stolen credentials are usually saved one per line in the following format: Sometimes, the delimiter between each component is changed to a comma, semicolon, or dash. For example, the following is how an infostealer will save credentials stolen from a device to a log: If someone is infected with an infostealer and has a thousand credentials saved in their browser, the infostealer will steal them all and store them in the log. These logs are then uploaded to the threat actor, where the credentials can be used for further attacks or sold on cybercrime marketplaces. The infostealer problem has gotten so bad and pervasive that compromised credentials have become one of the most common ways for threat actors to breach networks. We have a webinar next month titled \" Stolen credentials: The New Front Door to Your Network \" that focuses on infostealers, compromised credentials, and how organizations can protect themselves. This problem has also led law enforcement worldwide to actively crack down on these cybercrime operations in recent actions, such as \" Operation Secure \" and the disruption of LummaStealer . As infostealers have become so abundant and commonly used, threat actors release massive compilations for free on Telegram, Pastebin, and Discord to gain reputation among the cybercrime community or as teasers to paid offerings. To see how many passwords are given away for free, the single 1,261.4 MB file in the image above contained over 64,000 credential pairs. There are thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of similarly leaked archives being shared online, resulting in billions of credentials records released for free. Many of these free archives were likely compiled into massive data sets that were briefly exposed and seen by Cybernews. Similar credential collections were released in the past, such as the RockYou2024 leak , with over 9 billion records, and \" Colection #1 ,\" which contained over 22 million unique passwords. Despite the buzz, there's no evidence this compilation contains new or previously unseen data So, now that you know there was a massive leak of credentials likely stolen through infostealers, data breaches, and credential-stuffing attacks, you may be wondering what you should do. The most important step is to adopt and maintain good cybersecurity habits you should already be following. If you're concerned that an infostealer might be present on your computer, scan your device with a trusted antivirus program before changing any passwords. Otherwise, newly entered credentials could be stolen as well. Once you're confident your system is clean, focus on improving your password hygiene. That means using a unique, strong password for every site you use, and relying on a password manager to keep them organized and secure. However, even unique passwords won't help you stay protected if you are hacked, fall for a phishing attack, or install malware. Therefore, it is crucial that you also use two-factor authentication (2FA) along with an authentication app, like Microsoft Authenticator , Google Authenticator , or Authy , to manage your 2FA codes. Some password managers, like Bitwarden and 1Password, also include authentication functionality, allowing you to use one application for both. With 2FA enabled, even if a password at a site is compromised, threat actors cannot access the account without your 2FA code. As a general rule, you should avoid using SMS texts to receive 2FA codes, as threat actors can conduct SIM-swapping attacks to hijack your phone number and obtain them. As for this leak, with this many credentials leaked, there is a chance one of the readers of this article will be listed in the compilation. However, don't panic and stress about it, running around changing all your passwords. Instead, take this opportunity to improve your cybersecurity habits. To check if your credentials have appeared in known breaches, consider using services like Have I Been Pwned . And if you use the same password across multiple sites, now is the time to switch to unique ones. That way, leaks like this become far less dangerous to you. Update 6/20/25 10:08 PM EST: Article updated to clarify that this was multiple datasets found rather than a single database and to remove \"mother of all breaches,\" as that was to describe the other compilation discovered in 2024. Whether you're cleaning up old keys or setting guardrails for AI-generated code, this guide helps your team build securely from the start.

    "summary": "Temu denies it was hacked or suffered a data breach after a threat actor claimed to be selling a stolen database containing 87 million records of customer information. The threat actor put the alleged data up for sale yesterday on the BreachForums hacking forum, along with a small sample to serve as proof of the stolen data. Temu says it has examined and cross-checked the data samples with its database, but no matches were found. Temu is a rapidly growing e-commerce platform offering a wide range of products at competitive prices, focusing on low-cost clothing, home goods, electronics, and accessories. Temu is Chinese but operates globally, including in Europe and the United States, where it gained popularity for its deep discounts and promotional strategies. Though Temu has faced scrutiny over concerns relating to data privacy, product quality, and shipping times, it has not found itself at the epicenter of a major data breach incident as of yet. Yesterday, a threat actor using the moniker 'smokinthashit' claimed to have stolen a database with 87 million records from Temu and attempted to sell it to other cybercriminals. The threat actor published samples of the allegedly stolen data that contained usernames and IDs, IP addresses, full names, dates of birth, gender, shipping addresses, phone numbers, and hashed passwords. Responding to BleepingComputer's request for comment, Temu categorically denied the published data is theirs and said it would press charges against those spreading this misinformation. \"Temu's security team has conducted a comprehensive investigation into the alleged data breach and can confirm that the claims are categorically false; the data being circulated is not from our systems. Not a single line of data matches our transaction records,\" Temu told BleepingComputer. \"We take any attempt to tarnish our reputation or harm our users extremely seriously and reserve the right to pursue legal action against those responsible for spreading false information and attempting to profit from such malicious activities.\" \"At Temu, the security and privacy of our users are paramount. We follow industry-leading practices for data protection and cybersecurity, ensuring that consumers can shop with peace of mind on our platform.\" The e-commerce platform also underlined that it follows industry-leading data protection and cybersecurity practices, noting the app's MASA certification, independent validations, its HackerOne bug bounty program, and compliance with the PCI DSS payment security standard. BleepingComputer contacted the threat actor about the breach, and they continued to say they breached Temu. The threat actor claims to still have access to the company's email and internal panels, and that there are vulnerabilities in their code. However, the threat actor did not share any proof of these claims, and BleepingComputer cannot determine whether they are valid. Whether or not the data breach claims are valid, they can still harm a firm's reputation and seed distrust in customers. Out of an abundance of caution, if you are a Temu user, it would be prudent to enable two-factor authentication on your account, change the password to something new and unique, and stay vigilant for potential phishing attempts. BleepingComputer contacted Temu again about these further claims, but no response was immediately available. Update 9/19 : The threat actor has been banned on BreachForums for miserepresenting and attempting to sell data that was already publicly available. CheckPoint Research investigating on that claim told BleepingComputer that some of the information the threat actor posted appears to originate from a data breach at foreup.com, dating back to mid-2021.

    "summary": "The 2024 FinWise data breach serves as a stark example of the growing insider threats faced by modern financial institutions. Unlike typical cyberattacks originating from external hackers, this incident stemmed from unauthorized access by a former employee using retained credentials. On May 31, 2024, the ex-employee accessed FinWise Bank’s systems after leaving the company and leaked sensitive personal information belonging to 689,000 customers of American First Finance (AFF). Even more alarming, this unauthorized access went undetected for more than a year before being discovered by the bank on June 18, 2025. The most troubling aspect of the case lies in the time gap between the initial breach and its discovery. FinWise Bank only became aware of the incident and notified affected customers in June 2025 which was over a year after the breach occurred. Lawsuits allege that the stolen data may not have been adequately encrypted and secured, causing public criticism and concern. Security experts emphasize that a well-designed information protection framework must not only encrypt critical financial data but also proactively detect and prevent abnormal access attempts. FinWise Bank’s failure to implement such basic safeguards, coupled with potentially poor encryption practices, has led the institution to face legal action and heightened scrutiny from regulators and customers alike. Although FinWise has yet to issue an official statement regarding its encryption practices, the data breach will result in irreversible damage to both the company and its customers. In incidents like the FinWise breach, encryption serves as the last line of defense for data. However, true data protection goes beyond encryption alone; it also requires key management and access control measures. If FinWise properly implemented and managed its data encryption systems, the exposure of customers’ personal information could have been prevented even after the breach. Moreover, effective key management could have lowered the risk of data misuse, safeguarding sensitive information from further exploitation. Prevent data misuse after cyber attacks. D.AMO combines encryption, key management, and centeralized control to protect your organization’s most sensitive data. In response to data breaches like the one at FinWise, Penta Security’s D.AMO (Encryption Platform) has drawn renewed attention as an effective countermeasure. More than just a data encryption tool, D.AMO is a comprehensive data security platform that integrates powerful encryption, granular access control, and an independent key management system (KMS). Launched in 2004 as South Korea’s first packaged encryption solution and a pioneering product among global leaders, D.AMO has since established itself as a trusted name in the industry. With over 10,000 clients across finance, public, and enterprise sectors, D.AMO’s long-standing experience and proven technology have solidified its position as a leading force in the database encryption market. D.AMO has established itself as the No. 1 data encryption solution in South Korea’s public sector, recognized for its robust cybersecurity infrastructure and specialized expertise. Trusted by government institutions and major enterprises alike, it leads the market with unmatched reliability and technological depth. The platform supports multiple encryption methods, including API-based, plug-in-based, and kernel-level encryption, ensuring flexible deployment across both new implementations and live service environments. Going further, D.AMO enables selective column-level encryption based on data sensitivity, minimizing performance degradation while maintaining full compatibility across all layers of a customer’s system environment. In high-traffic sectors such as finance and government, service continuity is critical. D.AMO ensures that search and operational functions remain intact even after encryption, allowing organizations to achieve both operational efficiency and strong data protection. This balance of performance and security has made us the preferred choice for countless public institutions and large-scale enterprises. While encryption itself can prevent the misuse of sensitive information in the event of a data breach, effective key management is equally critical. The strength of any data encryption strategy is directly proportional to the security of its key management system. D.AMO KMS is a dedicated hardware appliance designed to securely manage encryption keys independently from the data they protect. By separating the privileges of database administrators and security administrators, D.AMO KMS ensures that even those with access to encrypted data cannot access the corresponding keys. This separation of duties serves as one of the most effective defenses against insider threats, such as the FinWise data breach. Furthermore, because D.AMO KMS stores keys in a physically and logically isolated appliance, encrypted data remains protected even if a hacker or insider were to gain full access to the database. Without the decryption keys, the stolen data remains unusable—providing a powerful safeguard against both internal and external breaches. D.AMO Control Center enables centralized management and access control for all encryption products deployed across every layer of a customer’s internal server infrastructure. Through this unified management system, administrators can monitor logs generated by each product and efficiently operate encryption solutions within a single, integrated interface. Incidents like the FinWise data breach underscore the critical importance of user access privileges in preventing insider threats. D.AMO Control Center addresses this challenge by providing granular privilege management, including user account separation, encryption/decryption permission settings, and data access control. By enforcing strict role-based access policies, organizations can proactively defend against potential insider misuse and strengthen overall data security governance. The FinWise data breach was not merely a technical incident, but a systemic failure rooted in inadequate security governance and potentially insufficient encryption and centralized management. This case highlights the growing need for financial institutions to adopt robust defense strategies—not only against external attacks, but also against unpredictable insider threats. Penta Security’s D.AMO provides a comprehensive solution to these challenges. Designed to meet global compliance standards such as PCI-DSS, GDPR, ITSCC, CCPA, and CPRA, D.AMO integrates data encryption (D.AMO), a dedicated key management system (D.AMO KMS), and centralized management (D.AMO Control Center) into a single, unified platform. Through its advanced audit and logging features, D.AMO detects potential data theft resulting from privilege abuse, and even in cases of internal access, its robust encryption and strict key management render the exposed data useless. An analysis of the FinWise breach shows that D.AMO directly addresses every vulnerability revealed in the incident. Organizations must shift their approach to data security from reactive response to proactive prevention. For any institution handling sensitive information, adopting an integrated encryption platform like D.AMO is no longer optional. Data encryption is a critical investment in the future of secure data management. > Download D.AMO White Paper to Learn More . Sponsored and written by Penta Security .",

    "summary": "​Ascension, one of the largest private U.S. healthcare systems, is notifying nearly 5.6 million patients and employees that their personal and health data was stolen in a May cyberattack linked to the Black Basta ransomware operation. The health network reported a total revenue of $28.3 billion in 2023 and operates 140 hospitals and 40 senior care facilities across the United States. The company now mails data breach notifications to 5,599,699 affected individuals via the United States Postal Service. Starting Thursday, December 19, Ascension also offers affected people 24 free months of IDX identity theft protection services, including CyberScan monitoring and a $1,000,000 insurance reimbursement policy. Ascension says it notified law enforcement and government partners, such as CISA and the FBI, of the breach after detecting the May 8 attack. \"Upon discovering the unauthorized activity, we initiated an investigation with the assistance of leading cybersecurity experts,\" Ascension states in the breach notification letters . \"Through this investigation, we found evidence that on May 7 and 8, a cybercriminal obtained a copy of certain files containing personal information of our patients and associates.\" Since the breach, Ascension's investigation has revealed that some of the stolen files contained patients' and employees' names and information across one or more of the following categories (the specific type of exposed information varies from one individual to another): After the incident, Ascension revealed that the ransomware breach was caused by an employee who downloaded a malicious file onto a company device. However, it believes this was likely an \"honest mistake,\" given that the employee thought they were downloading a legitimate file. The ransomware attack impacted Ascension's MyChart electronic health records system, phones, and systems for ordering tests, procedures, and medications. It also forced the healthcare giant to take some devices offline on May 8 to contain what it initially described as a \"cyber security event.\" Following the incident, Ascension employees had to keep track of procedures and medications on paper, as they could no longer access patients' electronic records. The company also had to pause some non-emergent elective procedures, tests, and appointments and divert emergency medical services to other healthcare units to prevent triage delays. While the healthcare giant has yet to link the May attack to a ransomware operation, CNN linked the Black Basta cybercrime gang to the incident (the ransomware group has yet to add Ascension to its data leak site). Days after the breach, the Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center (Health-ISAC) also warned that Black Basta \"has recently accelerated attacks against the healthcare sector.\" Since the operation emerged in April 2022, Black Basta has breached the networks of many high-profile victims, including German defense contractor Rheinmetall , outsourcing giant Capita , U.S. government contractor ABB , and the Toronto Public Library .

The company's investigation determined that the threat actor accessed data for employees and customers in Chile, Spain, and Uruguay. \"Following an investigation, we have now confirmed that certain information relating to customers of Santander Chile, Spain and Uruguay, as well as all current and some former Santander employees of the group had been accessed,\" reads a statement from Santander . \"Customer data in all other Santander markets and businesses are not affected.\" Fast forward two weeks, and as first spotted by Dark Web Informer , ShinyHunters is now claiming to sell the data for Santander customers in Chile, Spain, and Uruguay for $2 million, the same data the bank reported was stolen. ShinyHunters claims that the stolen data contains the personal information of 30 million customers and employees, 28 million credit card numbers, and 6 million account numbers and balances. As part of the sale listing, the threat actor also shared samples of the data that contains the listed information but cannot be confirmed to belong to Santander. It should be noted that Santander's Q1 2024 financial report states that there are only 19.5 million customers in those countries, rather than tht 30 million claimed by the threat actor. This sales listing comes soon after the FBI seized BreachForums on May 15th, which was operated by ShinyHunters and another threat actor known as Baphomet. While ShinyHunters says that Baphomet was arrested, he quickly restored the BreachForums site from a backup to a new domain. Since then, the threat actor posted the sale of Ticketmaster and Santander, which some feel was done to restore the reputation of the site after its takedown by law enforcement. However, what makes these sales unusual is that both were first listed on the Russian-speaking Exploit hacking forum days before they were listed on the newly-restored BreachForums. These sales were listed under the accounts of new members, with no reference to BreachForums or ShinyHunters, making others believe the sale on BreachForums is a fake. However, ShinyHunters has commonly acted as a data breach broker for other threat actors in the past, and it is not uncommon for these threat actors to create new aliases on various forums to sell stolen data. While TicketMaster has not confirmed whether a data breach occurred, ShinyHunters has a reputation for selling valid data breaches in the past. In 2021, Shiny Hunters claimed to be selling the stolen data of 73 million AT&T customers, which the company repeatedly denied to BleepingComputer. \"I don't care if they don't admit. I'm just selling,\" ShinyHunters told BleepingComputer at the time. In 2024, after the AT&T data was leaked on a hacking forum, AT&T finally confirmed that the data was legitimate and that they had suffered a breach.

While Allianz Life did not name the provider of the compromised cloud-based CRM system at the time of the disclosure, BleepingComputer first reported that the breach was part of a wave of Salesforce-targeted data theft attacks linked to the ShinyHunters extortion group. Since the attack, ShinyHunters has leaked the databases stolen from the company's Salesforce instances, containing roughly 2.8 million data records for individual customers and business partners, including wealth management companies, financial advisors, and brokers. On Monday, data breach notification service Have I Been Pwned revealed the extent of the incident, reporting that the email addresses, names, genders, dates of birth, phone numbers, and physical addresses of 1.1 million Allianz Life customers were stolen during the breach. BleepingComputer has also confirmed with multiple people affected by this breach that their data (including their tax IDs, phone numbers, email addresses, and other information) in the leaked files is accurate.

    "author": "Lawrence Abrams",
    "published": "October 27, 2025",
    "summary": "Google was once again forced to announce that it had not suffered a data breach after numerous news outlets published sensational stories about a fake breach that purportedly exposed 183 million accounts. This claim began over the weekend and into today, with news stories claiming that millions of Gmail accounts were breached, with some outlets saying it affected the full 183 million accounts. However, as the company explained in a series of posts on Monday, Gmail did not suffer a breach, and the compromised accounts were actually from a compilation of credentials stolen by information-stealing malware and other attacks over the years. \"Reports of a 'Gmail security breach impacting millions of users' are false. Gmail's defenses are strong, and users remain protected,\" reads a post on X . \"The inaccurate reports are stemming from a misunderstanding of infostealer databases, which routinely compile various credential theft activity occurring across the web. It's not reflective of a new attack aimed at any one person, tool, or platform.\" \"Several inaccurate claims surfaced recently that incorrectly stated that we issued a broad warning to all Gmail users about a major Gmail security issue. This is entirely false,\" Google added. This is just the latest such story that numerous news websites and cybersecurity companies have reported without verification in recent years. This particular story stems from Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) creator Troy Hunt announcing he recently added a massive collection of 183 million compromised credentials to the data breach notification platform shared by the threat intelligence platform Synthient. These credentials were not stolen in a single data breach, but rather through information-stealing malware, data breaches, credential stuffing, and phishing. Furthermore, these accounts are not for a single platform but for thousands, if not millions, of sites. Threat actors commonly collect exposed credentials and combine them into massive collections, which are then shared among the cybercrime community on Telegram channels, Discord servers, and hacking forums. After loading the data into HIBP, Hunt says 91% of the 183 million credentials had previously been seen, illustrating that many of them have been circulating for years. \"The final number once the entire data set was loaded into HIBP was 91% pre-existing, with 16.4M previously unseen addresses in any data breach, not just stealer logs,\" explained Hunt. Companies, including Google, commonly use collections like these to warn customers of exposed passwords and to force password resets to protect accounts. \"Gmail takes action when we spot large batches of open credentials, helping users reset passwords and resecure accounts,\" explained Google. While the claims of a Gmail data breach are false, that does not mean exposed credentials are harmless or should be ignored, as threat actors commonly use them to breach corporate networks and carry out devastating attacks. For example, the UnitedHealth Change Healthcare ransomware attack was caused by exposed Citrix credentials that enabled threat actors to gain initial network access. However, reports of unfounded data breaches do not help anyone and only cause undue stress and extra work for a platform's users and business customers. Just last month, Google had to state that it did not suffer a data breach after the same news sites claimed that 2.5 billion Gmail accounts had been compromised . While that claim stemmed from a Salesloft breach that impacted a small number of Google Workspace accounts , the story was quickly sensationalized into a much larger breach. If you are concerned that your credentials may have been part of the Synthient collection, you can register an account at Have I Been Pwned , open the dashboard, and click Stealer Logs to see if your account was compromised in the past by information-stealing malware. If you have accounts listed, perform an antivirus scan on your computer, then immediately change the passwords for all of your accounts.

This claim began over the weekend and into today, with news stories claiming that millions of Gmail accounts were breached, with some outlets saying it affected the full 183 million accounts. However, as the company explained in a series of posts on Monday, Gmail did not suffer a breach, and the compromised accounts were actually from a compilation of credentials stolen by information-stealing malware and other attacks over the years. \"Reports of a 'Gmail security breach impacting millions of users' are false. Gmail's defenses are strong, and users remain protected,\" reads a post on X . \"The inaccurate reports are stemming from a misunderstanding of infostealer databases, which routinely compile various credential theft activity occurring across the web. It's not reflective of a new attack aimed at any one person, tool, or platform.\" \"Several inaccurate claims surfaced recently that incorrectly stated that we issued a broad warning to all Gmail users about a major Gmail security issue. This is entirely false,\" Google added. This is just the latest such story that numerous news websites and cybersecurity companies have reported without verification in recent years. This particular story stems from Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) creator Troy Hunt announcing he recently added a massive collection of 183 million compromised credentials to the data breach notification platform shared by the threat intelligence platform Synthient. These credentials were not stolen in a single data breach, but rather through information-stealing malware, data breaches, credential stuffing, and phishing. Furthermore, these accounts are not for a single platform but for thousands, if not millions, of sites. Threat actors commonly collect exposed credentials and combine them into massive collections, which are then shared among the cybercrime community on Telegram channels, Discord servers, and hacking forums. After loading the data into HIBP, Hunt says 91% of the 183 million credentials had previously been seen, illustrating that many of them have been circulating for years. \"The final number once the entire data set was loaded into HIBP was 91% pre-existing, with 16.4M previously unseen addresses in any data breach, not just stealer logs,\" explained Hunt. Companies, including Google, commonly use collections like these to warn customers of exposed passwords and to force password resets to protect accounts. \"Gmail takes action when we spot large batches of open credentials, helping users reset passwords and resecure accounts,\" explained Google. While the claims of a Gmail data breach are false, that does not mean exposed credentials are harmless or should be ignored, as threat actors commonly use them to breach corporate networks and carry out devastating attacks. For example, the UnitedHealth Change Healthcare ransomware attack was caused by exposed Citrix credentials that enabled threat actors to gain initial network access. However, reports of unfounded data breaches do not help anyone and only cause undue stress and extra work for a platform's users and business customers. Just last month, Google had to state that it did not suffer a data breach after the same news sites claimed that 2.5 billion Gmail accounts had been compromised . While that claim stemmed from a Salesloft breach that impacted a small number of Google Workspace accounts , the story was quickly sensationalized into a much larger breach. If you are concerned that your credentials may have been part of the Synthient collection, you can register an account at Have I Been Pwned , open the dashboard, and click Stealer Logs to see if your account was compromised in the past by information-stealing malware. If you have accounts listed, perform an antivirus scan on your computer, then immediately change the passwords for all of your accounts. Whether you're cleaning up old keys or setting guardrails for AI-generated code, this guide helps your team build securely from the start. Get the cheat sheet and take the guesswork out of secrets management.

The sellers also provide information on using the stolen accounts to make fraudulent purchases, including Roku streaming boxes, sound bars, light strips, and TVs. After discovering this second wave of credential stuffing attacks, Roku has reset the passwords for all impacted accounts and is notifying affected customers directly about the incident.

Customers are also advised to choose strong and unique passwords for their accounts and alert Roku's customer support if they receive requests to share their credentials, update their payment details, or click suspicious links.

American Express is warning customers that credit cards were exposed in a third-party data breach after a merchant processor was hacked. This incident was not caused by a data breach at American Express, but rather at a merchant processor in which American Express Card member data was processed. In a data breach notification filed with the state of Massachusetts under \"American Express Travel Related Services Company,\" the company warned customers their credit cards may have been stolen. \"We became aware that a third party service provider engaged by numerous merchants experienced unauthorized access to its system,\" explains the data breach notification. \"Account information of some of our Card Members, including some of your account information, may have been involved. It is important to note that American Express owned or controlled systems were not compromised by this incident, and we are providing this notice to you as a precautionary measure.\" The breach has led to customers' American Express Card account numbers, names, and card expiration data being accessed by the hackers. It is unclear how many customers were impacted, what merchant processor was breached, and when the attack occurred. When BleepingComputer asked American Express for more information about the breach, we were told that they do not disclose details of their business relationships and merchant partners and had no further information to share at this time. However, American Express did say that they have notified the required regulatory authorities and are alerting impacted customers. \"When we learn about a data security incident that impacts our customers, we promptly begin an investigation and notify the appropriate regulatory authorities, as required,\" American Express told BleepingComputer. \"We also work to identify impacted customers and understand the specific impacts, and then notify them as required by applicable laws and regulations. Furthermore, if a cardmember's credit card is used to make fraudulent purchases, American Express told BleepingComputer that customers would not be responsible for the charges. American Express advises customers to review their account statement over the next 12 to 24 months and report any suspicious behavior. The company also suggests customers enable instant notifications via the American Express mobile app to receive notifications about fraud alerts and when purchases are made. Finally, if your card information was stolen, you may want to consider requesting a new card number, as it is common for threat actors to sell stolen credit cards on cybercrime marketplaces.

    "summary": "3/4/24: Article updated with further clarification from American Express that it was a merchant processor who was hacked, not one of their service providers. American Express is warning customers that credit cards were exposed in a third-party data breach after a merchant processor was hacked. This incident was not caused by a data breach at American Express, but rather at a merchant processor in which American Express Card member data was processed. In a data breach notification filed with the state of Massachusetts under \"American Express Travel Related Services Company,\" the company warned customers their credit cards may have been stolen. \"We became aware that a third party service provider engaged by numerous merchants experienced unauthorized access to its system,\" explains the data breach notification. \"Account information of some of our Card Members, including some of your account information, may have been involved. It is important to note that American Express owned or controlled systems were not compromised by this incident, and we are providing this notice to you as a precautionary measure.\" The breach has led to customers' American Express Card account numbers, names, and card expiration data being accessed by the hackers. It is unclear how many customers were impacted, what merchant processor was breached, and when the attack occurred. When BleepingComputer asked American Express for more information about the breach, we were told that they do not disclose details of their business relationships and merchant partners and had no further information to share at this time. However, American Express did say that they have notified the required regulatory authorities and are alerting impacted customers. \"When we learn about a data security incident that impacts our customers, we promptly begin an investigation and notify the appropriate regulatory authorities, as required,\" American Express told BleepingComputer. \"We also work to identify impacted customers and understand the specific impacts, and then notify them as required by applicable laws and regulations. Furthermore, if a cardmember's credit card is used to make fraudulent purchases, American Express told BleepingComputer that customers would not be responsible for the charges. American Express advises customers to review their account statement over the next 12 to 24 months and report any suspicious behavior. The company also suggests customers enable instant notifications via the American Express mobile app to receive notifications about fraud alerts and when purchases are made. Finally, if your card information was stolen, you may want to consider requesting a new card number, as it is common for threat actors to sell stolen credit cards on cybercrime marketplaces. As MCP (Model Context Protocol) becomes the standard for connecting LLMs to tools and data, security teams are moving fast to keep these new services safe.

    "summary": "Hackers have released stolen data belonging to US insurance giant Allianz Life, exposing 2.8 million records with sensitive information on business partners and customers in ongoing Salesforce data theft attacks. Last month, Allianz Life disclosed that it suffered a data breach when the personal information for the \"majority\" of its 1.4 million customers was stolen from a third-party, cloud-based CRM system on July 16th. While the company did not name the provider, BleepingComputer first reported the incident was part of a wave of Salesforce-targeted thefts carried out by the ShinyHunters extortion group. Over the weekend, ShinyHunters and other threat actors claiming overlap with \"Scattered Spider\" and \"Lapsus$\" created a Telegram channel called \" ScatteredLapsuSp1d3rHunters\" to taunt cybersecurity researchers, law enforcement, and journalists while taking credit for a string of high-profile breaches. Many of these attacks had not previously been attributed to any threat actor, including the attacks on Internet Archive , Pearson , and Coinbase . One of the attacks claimed by the threat actors is Allianz Life, for which they proceeded to leak the complete databases that were stolen from the company's Salesforce instances. These files consist of the Salesforce \" Accounts \" and \" Contacts \" database tables, containing approximately 2.8 million data records for individual customers and business partners, such as wealth management companies, brokers, and financial advisors. The leaked Salesforce data includes sensitive personal information, such as names, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, and Tax Identification Numbers, as well as professional details like licenses, firm affiliations, product approvals, and marketing classifications. BleepingComputer has been able to confirm with multiple people that their data in the leaked files is accurate, including their phone numbers, email addresses, tax IDs, and other information contained in the database. BleepingComputer contacted Allianz Life about the leaked database but was told that they could not comment as the investigation is ongoing. The Salesforce data theft attacks are believed to have started at the beginning of the year, with the threat actors conducting social engineering attacks to trick employees into linking a malicious OAuth app with their company's Salesforce instances. Once linked, the threat actors used the connection to download and steal the databases, which were then used to extort the company through email. Extortion demands were sent to the companies via email and were signed as coming from ShinyHunters. This notorious extortion group has been linked to many high-profile attacks over the years, including those against AT&T , PowerSchool , and the SnowFlake attacks . While ShinyHunters is known to target cloud SaaS applications and website databases, they are not known for these types of social engineering attacks, causing many researchers and the media to attribute some of the Salesforce attacks to Scattered Spider. However, ShinyHunters told BleepingComputer the \"ShinyHunters\" group and \"Scattered Spider\" are now one and the same. \"Like we have said repeatedly already, ShinyHunters and Scattered Spider are one and the same,\" ShinyHunters told BleepingComputer. \"They provide us with initial access and we conduct the dump and exfiltration of the Salesforce CRM instances. Just like we did with Snowflake.\" It is also believed that many of the group's members share their roots in another hacking group known as Lapsus$, which was responsible for numerous attacks in 2022-2023, before some of their members were arrested . Lapsus$ was behind breaches at Rockstar Games , Uber , 2K , Okta , T-Mobile , Microsoft , Ubisoft , and NVIDIA . Like Scattered Spider, Lapsus$ was also adept at social engineering attacks and SIM swap attacks, allowing them to run over billion and trillion-dollar companies' IT defenses. Over the past couple of years, there have been many arrests linked to all three collectives , so it's not clear if the current threat actors are old threat actors, new ones who have picked up the mantle, or are simply utilizing these names to plant false flags.

Customer personally identifiable information (PII) exposed in the security breach includes the affected individuals' names, addresses, social security numbers, dates of birth, and financial information, including account and credit card numbers, according to details shared with the Attorney General of Texas. Bank of America serves approximately 69 million clients at over 3,800 retail financial centers and through approximately 15,000 ATMs in the United States, its territories, and more than 35 countries. A Bank of America spokesperson declined to comment when BleepingComputer reached out for more details and asked us to connect with Infosys McCamish. While Bank of America has yet to disclose how many customers were impacted by the data breach, an IMS breach notification letter filed with the Attorney General of Maine on behalf of Bank of America revealed that a total of 57,028 people were directly impacted. \"Or around November 3, 2023, IMS was impacted by a cybersecurity event when an unauthorized third party accessed IMS systems, resulting in the non-availability of certain IMS applications,\" the data breach notification says . \"On November 24, 2023, IMS told Bank of America that data concerning deferred compensation plans serviced by Bank of America may have been compromised. Bank of America's systems were not compromised.\" \"It is unlikely that we will be able to determine with certainty what personal information was accessed as a result of this incident at IMS.\" The November security breach led to a \"non-availability of certain applications and systems in IMS,\" as explained when the incident was first disclosed in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. On November 4th, the LockBit ransomware gang claimed responsibility for the IMS attack , saying that its operators encrypted over 2,000 systems during the breach. The LockBit ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation came to light in September 2019 and has since targeted many high-profile organizations, including the UK Royal Mail , the Continental automotive giant , the City of Oakland , and the Italian Internal Revenue Service . In June, cybersecurity authorities in the United States and partners worldwide released a joint advisory estimating that the LockBit gang has extorted at least $91 million from U.S. organizations following roughly 1,700 attacks since 2020. Infosys, IMS' parent company, is a multinational IT consulting and services provider giant with over 300,000 employees and clients in over 56 countries.

    "summary": "An extortion group has launched a new data leak site to publicly extort dozens of companies impacted by a wave of Salesforce breaches , leaking samples of data stolen in the attacks. The threat actors responsible for these attacks claim to be part of the ShinyHunters, Scattered Spider, and Lapsus$ groups, collectively referring to themselves as \"Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters.\" Today, they launched a new data leak site containing 39 companies impacted by the attacks. Each entry includes samples of data allegedly stolen from victims' Salesforce instances, and warns the victims to reach out to \"prevent public disclosure\" of their data before the October 10 deadline is reached. The companies being extorted on the data leak site include well-known brands and organizations, including FedEx, Disney/Hulu, Home Depot, Marriott, Google, Cisco, Toyota, Gap, McDonald's, Walgreens, Instacart, Cartier, Adidas, Sake Fifth Avenue, Air France & KLM, Transunion, HBO MAX, UPS, Chanel, and IKEA. \"All of them have been contacted long ago, they saw the email because I saw them download the samples multiple times. Most of them chose to not disclose and ignore,\" ShinyHunters told BleepingComputer. \"We highly advise you proceed into the right decision, your organisation can prevent the release of this data, regain control over the situation and all operations remain stable as always. We highly recommend a decision-maker to get involved as we are presenting a clear and mutually beneficial opportunity to resolve this matter,\" they warned on the leak site. The threat actors also added a separate entry requesting that Salesforce pay a ransom to prevent all impacted customers' data (approximately 1 billion records containing personal information) from being leaked. \"Should you comply, we will withdraw from any active or pending negotiation indiviually from your customers. Your customers will not be attacked again nor will they face a ransom from us again, should you pay,\" they added. The extortion group also threatened the company, stating that it would help law firms pursue civil and commercial lawsuits against Salesforce following the data breaches and warned that the company had also failed to protect customers' data as required by the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters have been targeting Salesforce customers with voice phishing attacks since the beginning of the year , leading to breaches that have impacted companies such as Google , Cisco , Qantas , Adidas , Allianz Life , Farmers Insurance , Workday , as well as LVMH subsidiaries, including Dior , Louis Vuitton , and Tiffany & Co . In these attacks, the threat actors tricked employees into linking a malicious OAuth app to their company's Salesforce instance. ShinyHunters told BleepingComputer that while a particular Salesforce instance may have been targeted, it also contained data for many of the subsidiaries, making the attacks more impactful. Once connected, the attackers stole company databases and used the data to extort victims via email. These extortion emails were signed by ShinyHunters, a notorious extortion group linked to a long string of high-profile breaches in recent years, including the Snowflake attacks and those against AT&T and PowerSchool . ShinyHunters also claimed to have used stolen OAuth tokens for Salesloft's Drift AI chat integration with Salesforce to steal sensitive information, including passwords, AWS access keys, and Snowflake tokens, from customers' Salesforce instances. These attacks were tracked by Mandiant under a separate threat cluster named \"UNC6395\" as they have been unable to formally link the breaches to this group. On a Telegram channel associated with the extortion group, the threat actors claim that they will begin extorting companies affected by the Salesloft Drift attacks on a separate data leak site launching on October 10th. ShinyHunters previously told BleepingComputer that the Salesloft data theft attacks impacted approximately 760 companies and resulted in the theft of 1.5 billion Salesforce records . The Salesloft attacks are known to have impacted Google , Palo Alto Networks , CyberArk , Cloudflare , Rubrik , Elastic , BeyondTrust , Proofpoint , JFrog , Zscaler , Tenable , Nutanix , Qualys , and Cato Networks , among many others . ShinyHunters claim that companies will not be re-extorted under the Salesloft campaign if a ransom is paid in this initial extortion phase. \"We are aware of recent extortion attempts by threat actors, which we have investigated in partnership with external experts and authorities. Our findings indicate these attempts relate to past or unsubstantiated incidents, and we remain engaged with affected customers to provide support,\" Salesforce said in a statement published after ShinyHunters launched their data leak site. \"At this time, there is no indication that the Salesforce platform has been compromised, nor is this activity related to any known vulnerability in our technology.\" Update October 03, 11:02 EDT: Added Salesforce statement.

    "summary": "An extortion group has launched a new data leak site to publicly extort dozens of companies impacted by a wave of Salesforce breaches , leaking samples of data stolen in the attacks. The threat actors responsible for these attacks claim to be part of the ShinyHunters, Scattered Spider, and Lapsus$ groups, collectively referring to themselves as \"Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters.\" Today, they launched a new data leak site containing 39 companies impacted by the attacks. Each entry includes samples of data allegedly stolen from victims' Salesforce instances, and warns the victims to reach out to \"prevent public disclosure\" of their data before the October 10 deadline is reached. The companies being extorted on the data leak site include well-known brands and organizations, including FedEx, Disney/Hulu, Home Depot, Marriott, Google, Cisco, Toyota, Gap, McDonald's, Walgreens, Instacart, Cartier, Adidas, Sake Fifth Avenue, Air France & KLM, Transunion, HBO MAX, UPS, Chanel, and IKEA. \"All of them have been contacted long ago, they saw the email because I saw them download the samples multiple times. Most of them chose to not disclose and ignore,\" ShinyHunters told BleepingComputer. \"We highly advise you proceed into the right decision, your organisation can prevent the release of this data, regain control over the situation and all operations remain stable as always. We highly recommend a decision-maker to get involved as we are presenting a clear and mutually beneficial opportunity to resolve this matter,\" they warned on the leak site. The threat actors also added a separate entry requesting that Salesforce pay a ransom to prevent all impacted customers' data (approximately 1 billion records containing personal information) from being leaked. \"Should you comply, we will withdraw from any active or pending negotiation indiviually from your customers. Your customers will not be attacked again nor will they face a ransom from us again, should you pay,\" they added. The extortion group also threatened the company, stating that it would help law firms pursue civil and commercial lawsuits against Salesforce following the data breaches and warned that the company had also failed to protect customers' data as required by the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters have been targeting Salesforce customers with voice phishing attacks since the beginning of the year , leading to breaches that have impacted companies such as Google , Cisco , Qantas , Adidas , Allianz Life , Farmers Insurance , Workday , as well as LVMH subsidiaries, including Dior , Louis Vuitton , and Tiffany & Co . In these attacks, the threat actors tricked employees into linking a malicious OAuth app to their company's Salesforce instance. ShinyHunters told BleepingComputer that while a particular Salesforce instance may have been targeted, it also contained data for many of the subsidiaries, making the attacks more impactful. Once connected, the attackers stole company databases and used the data to extort victims via email. These extortion emails were signed by ShinyHunters, a notorious extortion group linked to a long string of high-profile breaches in recent years, including the Snowflake attacks and those against AT&T and PowerSchool . ShinyHunters also claimed to have used stolen OAuth tokens for Salesloft's Drift AI chat integration with Salesforce to steal sensitive information, including passwords, AWS access keys, and Snowflake tokens, from customers' Salesforce instances. These attacks were tracked by Mandiant under a separate threat cluster named \"UNC6395\" as they have been unable to formally link the breaches to this group. On a Telegram channel associated with the extortion group, the threat actors claim that they will begin extorting companies affected by the Salesloft Drift attacks on a separate data leak site launching on October 10th. ShinyHunters previously told BleepingComputer that the Salesloft data theft attacks impacted approximately 760 companies and resulted in the theft of 1.5 billion Salesforce records . The Salesloft attacks are known to have impacted Google , Palo Alto Networks , CyberArk , Cloudflare , Rubrik , Elastic , BeyondTrust , Proofpoint , JFrog , Zscaler , Tenable , Nutanix , Qualys , and Cato Networks , among many others . ShinyHunters claim that companies will not be re-extorted under the Salesloft campaign if a ransom is paid in this initial extortion phase. \"We are aware of recent extortion attempts by threat actors, which we have investigated in partnership with external experts and authorities. Our findings indicate these attempts relate to past or unsubstantiated incidents, and we remain engaged with affected customers to provide support,\" Salesforce said in a statement published after ShinyHunters launched their data leak site. \"At this time, there is no indication that the Salesforce platform has been compromised, nor is this activity related to any known vulnerability in our technology.\" Update October 03, 11:02 EDT: Added Salesforce statement.

Caesars discovered on September 7th that the attackers stole its loyalty program database, which stores driver's license numbers and social security numbers for many customers. \"We are still investigating the extent of any additional personal or otherwise sensitive information contained in the files acquired by the unauthorized actor,\" says an 8-K form filed by Caesars with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday. \"We have no evidence to date that any member passwords/PINs, bank account information, or payment card information (PCI) were acquired by the unauthorized actor.\" Caesars' 8-K also implies that a ransom demanded by the attackers was paid to prevent the leak of the stolen data online—a Wall Street Journal report says the hotel and casino entertainment company paid roughly $15 million, half of the attackers' initial $30 million demand. Nonetheless, Caesars made it clear that it cannot provide any assurances regarding the potential actions of the threat actors responsible for the incident, including the possibility that they might still sell or leak the customer's stolen information. \"We have taken steps to ensure that the stolen data is deleted by the unauthorized actor, although we cannot guarantee this result,\" Caesars said. \"We are monitoring the web and have not seen any evidence that the data has been further shared, published, or otherwise misused.\" While Caesars didn't link the attack to a specific cybercrime gang or threat actor, a Bloomberg report published on Wednesday claims the attack was conducted by a group known as Scattered Spider .

The AP Stylebook is a commonly used guide on grammar, punctuation, and writing style for journalists, magazines, and newsrooms worldwide.

The AP says they first learned of the possible data breach on July 20, 2023, after AP Stylebook customers reported receiving phishing emails stating they needed to update their credit card information.

    "summary": "Japanese electronics manufacturer Casio says that the October 2024 ransomware incident exposed the personal data of approximately 8,500 people. The affected individuals are primarily Casio employees and business partners, but there was a small set of customer personal information in the exposed data. The cyberattack occurred on October 5, when ransomware actors employing phishing tactics compromised the company's network and caused an IT systems outage . On October 10, the attack was claimed by the Underground ransomware gang, which threatened to disclose confidential documents, financial files, project information, and employee data unless a ransom was paid. Soon after, Casio confirmed that Underground had stolen the personal data of employees, partners, and customers. However, the company did not provide the number of affected people. With the investigation now completed, Casio is in a position to give the full details of the data breach scope. The latest announcement from the company lists the following exposed data: As impacted individuals are identified, they will receive personalized notices about the incident from Casio. Although some employees received unsolicited emails believed to be linked to the ransomware incident and sensitive data exposure, the company says there has been no secondary damage to them, their partners, or customers as of yet. Casio specified that no customer data or credit card information had been exposed to Underground ransomware, as their databases holding customer information were not impacted by this incident. The Japanese firm also made it clear that they did not negotiate with the cybercriminals. \"Following consultation with law enforcement agencies, outside counsel and security experts, Casio has not responded to any unreasonable demands from the ransomware group that carried out the unauthorized access,\" explains Casio . As for the impacted services, Casio says that most of them have returned to normal operational status, though some services have not been recovered yet. Meanwhile, although Casio's CASIO ID and ClassPad.net platforms are flagged as not impacted by the ransomware attack, those services also suffered a separate breach in October 2024.

    "summary": "Japanese electronics manufacturer Casio says that the October 2024 ransomware incident exposed the personal data of approximately 8,500 people. The affected individuals are primarily Casio employees and business partners, but there was a small set of customer personal information in the exposed data. The cyberattack occurred on October 5, when ransomware actors employing phishing tactics compromised the company's network and caused an IT systems outage . On October 10, the attack was claimed by the Underground ransomware gang, which threatened to disclose confidential documents, financial files, project information, and employee data unless a ransom was paid. Soon after, Casio confirmed that Underground had stolen the personal data of employees, partners, and customers. However, the company did not provide the number of affected people. With the investigation now completed, Casio is in a position to give the full details of the data breach scope. The latest announcement from the company lists the following exposed data: As impacted individuals are identified, they will receive personalized notices about the incident from Casio. Although some employees received unsolicited emails believed to be linked to the ransomware incident and sensitive data exposure, the company says there has been no secondary damage to them, their partners, or customers as of yet. Casio specified that no customer data or credit card information had been exposed to Underground ransomware, as their databases holding customer information were not impacted by this incident. The Japanese firm also made it clear that they did not negotiate with the cybercriminals. \"Following consultation with law enforcement agencies, outside counsel and security experts, Casio has not responded to any unreasonable demands from the ransomware group that carried out the unauthorized access,\" explains Casio . As for the impacted services, Casio says that most of them have returned to normal operational status, though some services have not been recovered yet. Meanwhile, although Casio's CASIO ID and ClassPad.net platforms are flagged as not impacted by the ransomware attack, those services also suffered a separate breach in October 2024.

    "summary": "U.S. educational nonprofit National Student Clearinghouse (NSC) has disclosed a data breach affecting 890 schools using its services across the United States. In a breach notification letter filed with the Office of the California Attorney General, Clearinghouse said that attackers gained access to its MOVEit managed file transfer (MFT) server on May 30 and stole files containing a wide range of personal information. \"On May 31, 2023, the Clearinghouse was informed by our third-party software provider, Progress Software, of a cybersecurity issue involving the provider's MOVEit Transfer solution,\" NSC said. \"After learning of the issue, we promptly initiated an investigation with the support of leading cybersecurity experts. We have also coordinated with law enforcement.\" The personally identifiable information (PII) contained in the stolen documents includes names, dates of birth, contact information, Social Security numbers, student ID numbers, and some school-related records (e.g., enrollment records, degree records, and course-level data). According to the data breach notification letters, the data exposed in the attack varies for each affected individual. The complete list of educational organizations affected by this massive data breach can be found here . NSC provides educational reporting, data exchange, verification, and research services to roughly 22,000 high schools and around 3,600 colleges and universities. The organization says its participants enroll roughly 97% of students in public and private institutions. In August, NSC revealed in a data breach filing with the Office of Maine’s attorney general that over 51,500 people were impacted in the incident. The Clop ransomware gang is responsible for the extensive data-theft attacks that started on May 27, leveraging a zero-day security flaw in the MOVEit Transfer secure file transfer platform. Starting June 15, the cyber criminals began extorting organizations that fell victim to the attacks, exposing their names on the group's dark web data leak site. The fallout from these attacks is anticipated to impact hundreds of organizations globally, with many already notifying affected customers over the past four months. Despite the widespread potential victim pool, estimates from Coveware suggest that only a limited number are likely to yield to Clop's ransom demands. Nonetheless, the cybercrime gang is expected to collect an estimated $75-100 million in payments due to the high ransom requests. Reports have also revealed that multiple U.S. federal agencies and two U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) entities have fallen prey to these data theft and extortion attacks.

    "url": "https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-fake-ledger-data-breach-emails-try-to-steal-crypto-wallets/",
    "author": "Lawrence Abrams",
    "published": "December 17, 2024",
    "summary": "A new Ledger phishing campaign is underway that pretends to be a data breach notification asking you to verify your recovery phrase, which is then stolen and used to steal your cryptocurrency. Ledger is a hardware cryptocurrency wallet that allows you to store, manage, and sell cryptocurrency. The funds in these wallets are secured using 24-word recovery phrases or 12 and 18-word phrases generated by other wallets. Anyone who knows your Ledger recovery phrase can use it to access the funds within the wallet. Therefore, recovery phrases must always be kept offline and never shared with anyone to prevent cryptocurrency funds from being stolen. Ledger has long been a target of phishing campaigns that attempt to steal users' recovery phrases or push fake Ledger Live software to steal information. These campaigns became significantly worse after Ledger suffered a data breach in 2020 that exposed its customers' names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses. However, over the past few days, multiple people have notified BleepingComputer or shared on X that they received a Ledger phishing email that pretends to be a new data breach notification. The phishing emails have the subject of \"Security Alert: Data Breach May Expose Your Recovery Phrase\" and appear to be from \"Ledger <support@ledger.com\". However, they are actually sent through the SendGrid email marketing platform. The phishing emails claim that Ledger suffered a data breach and that some recovery phrases have been exposed. The email then goes on to say that the user must verify their recovery phrase on Ledger's official verification page. \"We regret to inform you that a recent data breach has affected our service. While your Ledger wallet remains secure, there is a possibility that recovery phrases (also known as \"seed phrases\") linked to certain accounts have been exposed,\" reads the phishing email. \"To safeguard your assets, we strongly encourage you to verify the security of your recovery phrase through our secure verification tool.\" Clicking the \"Verify My Recovery Phrase\" button brings you to an Amazon AWS website at \"https://product-ledg.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws[.]com/recover.html\" that then redirects users to a phishing page at \"ledger-recovery[.]info\". The ledger-recovery[.]info domain was registered on December 15th, 2024. This website pretends to be a Ledger site that asks you to perform a security check to see if your recovery phrase is compromised, as shown below. Clicking the \"Verify your Ledger now\" brings up another page asking you to enter your 12, 18, or 24-word Ledger recovery phrase. As you enter each word, the phishing page will check if the word is one of 2,048 valid words that can be entered as part of a recovery phrase. If a word not on the list is entered, it will be shown with a line through it. As you enter each word, the phishing page will send all of the entered recovery words to the site's backend to store them on the server. BleepingComputer was told that no matter what recovery phrase you enter, it will always state that it was invalid. It is believed this being done so that targets enter the phrase multiple times, allowing the phishing page to verify that the correct words are being entered. Other people have also shared other Ledger phishing emails sent out recently, including one that pretends to be a new firmware update. It, too, attempts to steal users' recovery phrases. Armed with the recovery phrase, the attackers can gain full access to your cryptocurrency funds and steal them. First and foremost, never enter your recovery phrase or secret passphrase in any app or website. Recovery phrases should only be entered directly on the Ledger device you are trying to recover. As it is easy to create lookalike domains that impersonate legitimate sites, when it comes to cryptocurrency and financial assets, always type the domain you're trying to reach into your browser rather than relying on links in emails.

    "summary": "A new Ledger phishing campaign is underway that pretends to be a data breach notification asking you to verify your recovery phrase, which is then stolen and used to steal your cryptocurrency. Ledger is a hardware cryptocurrency wallet that allows you to store, manage, and sell cryptocurrency. The funds in these wallets are secured using 24-word recovery phrases or 12 and 18-word phrases generated by other wallets. Anyone who knows your Ledger recovery phrase can use it to access the funds within the wallet. Therefore, recovery phrases must always be kept offline and never shared with anyone to prevent cryptocurrency funds from being stolen. Ledger has long been a target of phishing campaigns that attempt to steal users' recovery phrases or push fake Ledger Live software to steal information. These campaigns became significantly worse after Ledger suffered a data breach in 2020 that exposed its customers' names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses. However, over the past few days, multiple people have notified BleepingComputer or shared on X that they received a Ledger phishing email that pretends to be a new data breach notification. The phishing emails have the subject of \"Security Alert: Data Breach May Expose Your Recovery Phrase\" and appear to be from \"Ledger <support@ledger.com\". However, they are actually sent through the SendGrid email marketing platform. The phishing emails claim that Ledger suffered a data breach and that some recovery phrases have been exposed. The email then goes on to say that the user must verify their recovery phrase on Ledger's official verification page. \"We regret to inform you that a recent data breach has affected our service. While your Ledger wallet remains secure, there is a possibility that recovery phrases (also known as \"seed phrases\") linked to certain accounts have been exposed,\" reads the phishing email. \"To safeguard your assets, we strongly encourage you to verify the security of your recovery phrase through our secure verification tool.\" Clicking the \"Verify My Recovery Phrase\" button brings you to an Amazon AWS website at \"https://product-ledg.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws[.]com/recover.html\" that then redirects users to a phishing page at \"ledger-recovery[.]info\". The ledger-recovery[.]info domain was registered on December 15th, 2024. This website pretends to be a Ledger site that asks you to perform a security check to see if your recovery phrase is compromised, as shown below. Clicking the \"Verify your Ledger now\" brings up another page asking you to enter your 12, 18, or 24-word Ledger recovery phrase. As you enter each word, the phishing page will check if the word is one of 2,048 valid words that can be entered as part of a recovery phrase. If a word not on the list is entered, it will be shown with a line through it. As you enter each word, the phishing page will send all of the entered recovery words to the site's backend to store them on the server. BleepingComputer was told that no matter what recovery phrase you enter, it will always state that it was invalid. It is believed this being done so that targets enter the phrase multiple times, allowing the phishing page to verify that the correct words are being entered. Other people have also shared other Ledger phishing emails sent out recently, including one that pretends to be a new firmware update. It, too, attempts to steal users' recovery phrases. Armed with the recovery phrase, the attackers can gain full access to your cryptocurrency funds and steal them. First and foremost, never enter your recovery phrase or secret passphrase in any app or website. Recovery phrases should only be entered directly on the Ledger device you are trying to recover. As it is easy to create lookalike domains that impersonate legitimate sites, when it comes to cryptocurrency and financial assets, always type the domain you're trying to reach into your browser rather than relying on links in emails. This way, you know you are going to ledger.com rather than a site impersonating it. Finally, disregard any emails claiming to be from Ledger stating that you were affected by a recent data breach or asking you to verify your recovery phrase. Ledger will never ask you for your recovery phrase, and as previously said, it should never be shared with anyone else.

    "summary": "Chinese shopping platform Pandabuy told BleepingComputer it previously paid a ransom demand to prevent stolen data from being leaked, only for the same threat actor to extort the company again this week. PandaBuy is an online platform that acts as an intermediary between customers and various Chinese e-commerce websites, including Tmall, Taobao, and JD.com, which don't ship internationally. The service allows users to purchase products from these websites, which are often cheaper or have unique items not available elsewhere, and have them shipped to their location. On March 31, 2024, a threat actor using the alias 'Sanggiero' published 3 million rows of data stolen from PandaBuy on BreachForums, exposing customer names, phone numbers, email addresses, login IP addresses, home addresses, and order details. The threat actor claimed they managed to steal that data by exploiting several critical vulnerabilities in the PandaBuy API. This data was shared with the data breach notification service Have I Been Pwned (HIBP), which added 1.35 million email addresses from this incident to its system. At the time, Pandabuy opted not to make any public statements, and there were even reports of the firm attempting to censor customer reports on Discord and Reddit. On June 3, 2024, the same threat actor offered to sell what he claimed was the entire database he previously stole from Pandabuy for $40,000. This database allegedly contains 17 million rows, indicating a much larger data set. Sanggiero did not provide evidence of additional customer data in the form of samples but uploaded screenshots showing sensitive employee information such as emails and passwords. A Pandabuy spokesperson admitted to BleepingComputer that they had paid the hacker an undisclosed amount to stop the data leak, adding that the threat actor may have shared the data with others, so they would no longer cooperate with him. \" At present, we cannot continue to pay the hacker fees due to the frozen funds, and the data he leaked is the same as the last one. We have confirmed with the technical department that all the loopholes have been fixed at the time of the first leak incident. And for all we know, he secretly sold our data to other agents after he made the deal with us. We can not cooperate with him in the future. \" BleepingComputer reached out to Sanggiero about the company's statement but has not heard back at this time. For now, it is better to take an abundance of caution and be on the lookout for unsolicited messages from people claiming to be Pandabuy, which may be a phishing attempt to gather additional personal nformation. If you have not previously reset your password at Pandabuy, it is strongly advised that you do so now, in case additional data was stolen, as the threat actor claims.

Though this is a step forward, the company has still not officially disclosed the exact number of individuals impacted by the security incident.

PowerSchool is a cloud-based K-12 software provider serving over 60 million students and 18,000 customers worldwide, offering enrollment, communication, attendance, staff management, learning, analytics, and finance solutions. In December, the company suffered a breach where attackers gained unauthorized access to one of its customer support portals, PowerSource, and stole sensitive data from 6,505 school districts. The stolen data includes varying types of information per district, including full names, physical addresses, contact information, Social Security numbers (SSNs), medical data, and grades.

In an update published on the PowerSchool website yesterday, the company says it has started notifying individuals affected by the data breach. This includes current and former students, if applicable, their parents and guardians, and also educators in the U.S., Canada, and abroad. \"PowerSchool began the process of filing regulatory notifications with Attorneys General Offices across applicable U.S. jurisdictions on behalf of impacted customers who have not opted-out of our offer to do so,\" reads the status update . \"PowerSchool has also started the process of notifying Canadian regulators.

The fallout from these attacks impacted hundreds of organizations worldwide, with tens of millions of people having their data stolen and used in extortion schemes or leaked online since then Multiple U.S. federal agencies and two U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) entities have also been targeted and breached in these attacks As MCP (Model Context Protocol) becomes the standard for connecting LLMs to tools and data, security teams are moving fast to keep these new services safe.

WebTPA is a GuideWell Mutual Holding Corporation subsidiary and a third-party administrator (TPA) that provides customized administrative services to health plans and insurance companies. It employs 18,000 people and generates $103 million in annual revenue. The breach happened last year but it was discovered last December, when the company found evidence of suspicious activity on its network. A recent update on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services data breach portal shows that the number of affected individuals is 2,429,175. According to the notification on WebTPA's website, the threat actor had access to personal data for five days, between April 18 and April 23, 2023. However, WebTPA discovered the breach only in late December and immediately launched an investigation. “On December 28, 2023, we detected evidence of suspicious activity on the WebTPA network that prompted us to launch an investigation,” reads the announcement . “The investigation concluded that the unauthorized actor may have obtained personal information between April 18 and April 23, 2023,” WebTPA notes. WebTPA informed benefit plan providers and insurance companies of the data breach on March 25, 2024. The company sent notices to affected individuals on May 8, 2024, informing that the following types of data had been exposed: The investigation revealed that financial account information, credit card numbers, medical treatment, and diagnostic information have not been exposed to unauthorized access. Multiple health plan and insurance organizations have published notifications saying that the WebTPA data breach has impacted some of their customers. Among the companies with customers affected by the WebTPA breach are Dean Health Plan , APA Voluntary Supplemental Medical Plan , The Hartford (Critical Illness, Hospital Indemnity, Accident, Medicare Supplement and Tricare products), Transamerica , and Gerber Life Insurance. In the data breach notification, WebTPA has included instructions on how to enroll for two years of credit monitoring, identity theft protection, and fraud consultation services through Kroll, which is possible until August 1st. Although WebTPA says it’s not aware of any cases of misuse of the exposed data, affected individuals should remain vigilant for communications from potential fraudsters and refrain from sharing any personal or financial information in such cases.

The notification warns that the hacker gained unauthorized access to Pizza Hut Australia systems storing sensitive info for customers who made online orders, as well as partial financial data and encrypted account passwords. \"We became aware in early September of a cyber security incident where an unauthorized third party accessed some of the company's data,\" reads the notice sent to customers. \"We have confirmed that the data impacted relates to customer record details and online order transactions held on our Pizza Hut Australia customer database.\" The information that has been exposed to the network intruders includes the following: The restaurant chain, which operates in 260 locations in Australia, says recipients of its notices \"may wish to consider\" updating their password despite being \"one-way encrypted\" in the database. Moreover, the notice urges customers to stay vigilant for phishing attacks and suspicious links sent to them via unsolicited communications. Ultimately, Pizza Hut says the incident only impacts a small number of its customers, and the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) has been fully informed about the situation. The exact number of impacted customers was disclosed via a statement from a Pizza Hut spokesperson to The Guardian , stating that the incident affected 193,000 people. At the start of September 2023, DataBreaches reported that the notorious data broker 'ShinyHunters' made claims about stealing the data of 1 million customers of Pizza Hut Australia. The threat actor alleged they gained access via an unprotected Amazon Web Services (AWS) endpoint between July and August 2023, accessing a database with 30 million orders. Pizza Hut Australia never responded to these allegations, so it is unclear whether the two incidents are in any way related. Earlier this year, in January 2023, the owner of Pizza Hut, Yum!

    "summary": "A wave of data breaches impacting companies like Qantas, Allianz Life, LVMH, and Adidas has been linked to the ShinyHunters extortion group, which has been using voice phishing attacks to steal data from Salesforce CRM instances. In June, Google's Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) warned that threat actors tracked as UNC6040 were targeting Salesforce customers in social engineering attacks . In these attacks, the threat actors impersonated IT support staff in phone calls to targeted employees, attempting to persuade them into visiting Salesforce's connected app setup page. On this page, they were told to enter a \"connection code\", which linked a malicious version of Salesforce's Data Loader OAuth app to the target's Salesforce environment. In some cases, the Data Loader component was renamed to \"My Ticket Portal,\" to make it more convincing in the attacks. GTIG says that these attacks were usually conducted through vishing (voice phishing), but credentials and MFA tokens were also stolen through phishing pages that impersonated Okta login pages. Around the time of this report, multiple companies reported data breaches involving third-party customer service or cloud-based CRM systems. LVMH subsidiaries Louis Vuitton , Dior , and Tiffany & Co. each disclosed unauthorized access to a customer information database, with Tiffany Korea notifying customers the attackers breached a \"vendor platform used for managing customer data.\" Adidas , Qantas , and Allianz Life also reported breaches involving third-party systems, with Allianz confirming it was a third-party customer relationship management platform. \"On July 16, 2025, a malicious threat actor gained access to a third-party, cloud-based CRM system used by Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America (Allianz Life),\" an Allianz Life spokesperson told BleepingComputer. While BleepingComputer has learned that the Qantas data breach also involved a third-party customer relationship management platform, the company will not confirm it is Salesforce. However, previous reporting from local media claims the data was stolen from Qantas' Salesforce instance. Furthermore, court documents state that the threat actors targeted \" Accounts \" and \" Contacts \" database tables, both of which are Salesforce objects. While none of these companies have publicly named Salesforce, BleepingComputer has since confirmed that all were targeted in the same campaign detailed by Google. The attacks have not led to public extortion or data leaks yet, with BleepingComputer learning that the threat actors are attempting to privately extort companies over email, where they name themselves as ShinyHunters. It is believed that when these extortion attempts fail, the threat actors will release stolen information in a long wave of leaks, similar to ShinyHunter's previous Snowflake attacks . \"We have not identified any data leak sites associated with this activity,\" Genevieve Stark, Head of Cybercrime, and Information Operations Intelligence Analysis at GTIG, told BleepingComputer. \"It is plausible that the threat actor intends to sell the data instead of sharing it publicly. This approach would align with prior ShinyHunters Group activity.\" Google say they are now tracking Salesforce data-theft attacks under multiple threat group designations. \"GTIG attributes multiple incidents impacting Salesforce instances to UNC6040. In at least some cases, the follow-on extortion activity, which we attribute to the distinct threat cluster UNC6240, has used the ShinyHunters brand,\" Stark told BleepingComputer. \"The extortion activity is attributed to UNC6240 instead of UNC6040 due to a significant time gap between the initial data theft activity and the subsequent extortion activity. We have not confirmed the nature of the relationship between these intrusions and the prior use of this handle on underground forums.\" The breaches have caused confusion among the cybersecurity community and the media, including BleepingComputer, with the attacks attributed to Scattered Spider (tracked by Mandiant as UNC3944), as those threat actors were also targeting the aviation , retail , and insurance sectors around the same time and demonstrated similar tactics. However, threat actors associated with Scattered Spider tend to perform full-blown network breaches, culminating with data theft and, sometimes, ransomware. ShinyHunters, tracked as UNC6040, on the other hand, tends to focus more on data-theft extortion attacks targeting a particular cloud platform or web application. It is BleepingComputer's and some security researchers' belief that both UNC6040/UNC6240 and UNC3944 consist of overlapping members that communicate within the same online communities. The threat group is also believed to overlap with \"The Com,\" a network of experienced English-speaking cybercriminals. \"According to Recorded Future intelligence, the overlapping TTPs between known Scattered Spider and ShinyHunters attacks indicate likely some crossover between the two groups,\" Allan Liska, an Intelligence Analyst for Recorded Future, told BleepingComputer. Other researchers have told BleepingComputer that ShinyHunters and Scattered Spider appear to be operating in lockstep, targeting the same industries at the same time, making it harder to attribute attacks. Some also believe that both groups have ties to threat actors from the now-defunct Lapsus$ hacking group , with reports indicating that one of the recently arrested Scattered Spider hackers was also in Lapsus$ . Another theory is that ShinyHunters is acting as an extortion-as-a-service, where they extort companies on behalf of other threat actors in exchange for a revenue share, similar to how ransomware-as-a-service gangs operate. This theory is supported by previous conversations BleepingComputer has had with ShinyHunters, where they claimed not to be behind a breach, but just acting as the seller of the stolen data. These breaches include PowerSchool , Oracle Cloud , the Snowflake data-theft attacks , AT&T , NitroPDF , Wattpad , MathWay , and many more . To muddy the waters further, there have been numerous arrests of people linked to the name \"ShinyHunters,\" including those who have been arrested for the Snowflake data-theft attacks , breaches at PowerSchool , and the operation of the Breached v2 hacking forum . Yet even after these arrests, new attacks occur with companies receiving extortion emails stating, \"We are ShinyHunters,\" referring to themselves as a \"collective.\" In a statement to BleepingComputer, Salesforce emphasized that the platform itself was not compromised, but rather, customers' accounts are being breached via social engineering. \"Salesforce has not been compromised, and the issues described are not due to any known vulnerability in our platform. While Salesforce builds enterprise-grade security into everything we do, customers also play a critical role in keeping their data safe — especially amid a rise in sophisticated phishing and social engineering attacks,\" Salesforce told BleepingComputer. \"We continue to encourage all customers to follow security best practices, including enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA), enforcing the principle of least privilege, and carefully managing connected applications. For more information, please visit: https://www.salesforce.com/blog/protect-against-social-engineering/ .\" Salesforce is urging customers to strengthen their security posture by: Further details on these mitigations can be found in Salesforce's guidance linked above.

Hunt's findings come after the company filed a breach notification with the Office of the Maine Attorney General, stating that the breach only impacted 64,472 people . In a separate incident notification published on its website, Neiman Marcus revealed that the data exposed in the attack included names, contact information (e.g., email and postal addresses, and phone numbers), dates of birth, gift card info, transaction data, partial credit card (without expiration dates or CVVs) and Social Security numbers, and employee identification numbers. While analyzing the data stolen in the breach, Hunt found 30 million unique email addresses and told BleepingComputer that he also confirmed with multiple people whose data was in the stolen database that the information was legitimate. \"That's obviously a substantial number and I do want to get notifications out to them promptly.

    "author": "Home",
    "published": "September 20, 2023",
    "summary": "The dreaded data breach is an outcome feared by companies of all sizes in today’s threat landscape, largely due to the significant costs involved. Each year, IBM’s eagerly anticipated Cost of a Data Breach Report seems to come with the bad news of an increase in data breach costs, and 2023 is no exception. Threat actors continue their relentless pursuit of data as the most valuable company resource to compromise in cyberattacks. The average cost of a data breach now stands at an all-time high of $4.45 million. While this overall figure receives much of the publicity in media reports, there’s less emphasis on how increasingly costly incident investigations drive much of this year-on-year increase. Read on to dive deeper into why data breach investigations are so expensive and find out what your business can do to reduce these costs. Investigating a data breach involves a resource-intensive combination of technical, administrative, legal, and communication activities, which together prove rather pricey for companies. The 2022 IBM report marked the point at which incident investigations (referred to in the report as ‘detection and escalation’) took over as the costliest category of data breach expenses. That trend continues in the 2023 report , which shows that detection and escalation cost an average of $1.58 million per breach, or over 35 percent of the total average cost. But why are data breach investigation costs on the rise? Here are some factors driving the increased expenses: Reducing the cost of data breach investigations requires a mix of proactive and reactive measures to ensure not only that you're ready when a breach occurs but also that you're taking steps to prevent them in the first place. Here are some suggestions for preventing data breaches in the first place: Information governance defines and enforces policies, procedures, standards, and controls around the management of data. The objective is to make sure that your company and its people handle data efficiently, securely, and in compliance with legal and regulatory obligations. Robust information governance is pivotal for answering questions like what data you have, where it’s stored, and who has access to it. Policy-based controls and tools can help maintain an inventory of your information assets and delete unneeded data on time. Uniform procedures mean that users are more likely to consistently handle and store data, regardless of their business department/unit. All of this helps to uncover gaps in protection for your data assets and reduce breach risks due to lax practices. Regularly educate employees about the importance of security and how to recognize phishing attempts and other threats. Employees should understand their responsibilities in handling data securely and know how to avoid risky practices, such as visiting untrusted websites. A security-conscious workforce goes a long way towards reducing risks from the significant human factor in data breaches. Treat security training and awareness as ongoing throughout the year rather than an annual or quarterly internal box to tick. Regular reminders dotted around the office, a range of different media to spread awareness, and some fun exercises can all help reinforce what’s important to learn (and remember). Continuous vulnerability management (CVM) takes a more proactive approach to identifying, assessing, and addressing vulnerabilities in an organization's IT environment. Vulnerability management is often too reactive, which leaves gaping holes that threat actors can find and exploit to access data. One study from 2020 found that 84 percent of companies had high-risk vulnerabilities that were accessible and exploitable at their network perimeter. The CVM approach is to routinely scan your IT infrastructure for known vulnerabilities. Early detection allows your business to patch or mitigate vulnerabilities before hackers exploit them in their pursuit of data. With CVM, you’re more likely to apply software updates and patches and avoid data breaches that stem from outdated, vulnerable code. Simulated cyberattacks involve security professionals attempting to breach your defenses in a scenario that mirrors a real-world cyberattack. Simulated attacks help pinpoint weaknesses in infrastructure, applications, and other systems that you didn’t even know about. Discovering these gaps proactively enables you to address them before they're exploited ‘in the wild’ by data-hungry adversaries. Another benefit of addressing weaknesses found during simulated attacks is that it’s typically less expensive than managing the fallout from a real data breach. Proactive testing can save significant costs in the long run from direct remediation expenses to reputational damages and potential fines. Effective forensic and investigative activities drive faster detection and response to data breaches. Delays in identifying and containing breaches lead to higher investigation costs. It takes companies 204 days on average to identify a breach and 73 days to contain each breach in 2023, as reported by IBM. Actionable and reliable cyber threat intelligence (CTI) plays an instrumental role in informing forensic and investigative activities. As a result, good CTI helps you respond to breaches faster and more cost-effectively. CTI involves gathering, analyzing, and disseminating information about current and potential cyber threats and attack methods. The difficulty with gathering good cyber threat intelligence is that it’s time-consuming, which is not ideal given that your in-house security staff deal with many other problems and priorities each day. Chronic labor market shortages don’t help; CTI requires experts who know what intel sources are good, and how to analyze data to distinguish between useful and useless information. Despite its power in reducing data breach costs and keeping your fingers on the pulse of a rapidly evolving threat landscape, 79 percent of security professionals say they make decisions without any threat intelligence. To overcome this dearth of intelligence-backed decisions when trying to swiftly detect and respond to data breaches, consider leveraging Cyber Threat Intelligence with Outpost 24’s Threat Compass. Our solution is modular, which means you get to select only the types of intelligence that you feel are most pertinent for your business, sector, and areas of cyber risk. Our in-house team of analysts use 13+ years of historical threat data along with continuously trawling the open, deep, and dark web to discover customer-specific threat information.

According to Reuters, who spoke to numerous TaskUs employees, the data breach was first discovered in January after a TaskUs employee was caught capturing photos of her computer screen using a personal device. Reportedly, the incident was witnessed by multiple TaskUs employees, and during the subsequent investigations, two admitted they were funneling sensitive Coinbase user data to external hackers in exchange for bribes. Upon confirming the data theft in January 2025, TaskUs informed Coinbase accordingly, four months before the breach was publicly disclosed. Coinbase first disclosed the incident on May 15, stating that rogue support agents stole customer data, including names, emails, partial financial information and SSN, transaction history, and ID document scans. \"Cyber criminals bribed and recruited a group of rogue overseas support agents to steal Coinbase customer data to facilitate social engineering attacks.

Coinbase further stated that the threat actors demanded a ransom payment of $20,000,000 from Coinbase not to publish the stolen data. Instead of succumbing to the demands, the cryptocurrency exchange offered an equal-value reward to unmask those responsible for the extortion attempt. Coinbase estimated that the incident would cause losses of up to $400 million. On May 21, Coinbase started notifying nearly 70,000 customers who were impacted by the incident. BleepingComputer contacted both Coinbase and TaskUs about the Reuters report, and a TaskUs spokesperson confirmed that they were involved but stated the employees were recruited as part of a much larger, coordinated criminal campaign. \"Early this year we identified two individuals who illegally accessed information from one of our clients,\" TaskUs told BleepingComputer. \"We believe these two individuals were recruited by a much broader, coordinated criminal campaign against this client that also impacted a number of other providers servicing this client.\" \"We immediately reported this activity to the client, terminated the individuals involved, and are coordinating with law enforcement.

The Miami-based company operates 12 locations across the United States and India, and it also provides revenue cycle management services to over 6,000 healthcare providers, helping them reduce operating costs and maximize revenue. Medisund says in a data breach notification letter filed with the Office of Maine's Attorney General that it spotted the breach more than one year ago, in December 2023, after detecting suspicious activity on its network. \"Upon discovering the suspicious activity, Medusind took the affected systems offline and hired a leading cybersecurity forensic firm to conduct an investigation,\" according to the breach notice. \"Through this investigation, we found evidence that a cybercriminal may have obtained a copy of certain files containing your personal information.\" In the Maine filing , the company revealed that the December 2023 breach affected the personal and health information of 360,934 individuals. Documents exposed in the incident contained the following data types, although the impacted information varies by affected individual: Medusind offers those affected by this data breach two years of free Kroll identity monitoring services, including credit monitoring, fraud consultation, and identity theft restoration. It also warned them to keep track of their account statements for signs of potential identity theft and fraud attempts and to monitor credit reports for unauthorized or suspicious activity. These notifications come after the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) proposed updates to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) in late December 2024 to secure patients' health data following a surge in massive healthcare security breaches and data leaks affecting hospitals and Americans in recent years. These overhauled cybersecurity rules mandate healthcare organizations to encrypt Americans' protected health information (PHI), implement multifactor authentication wherever possible, and segment networks to make it harder for cybercriminals to move laterally through them. Ascension, one of the largest private U.S. healthcare systems, recently alerted nearly 5.6 million people that their data was stolen in a May cyberattack claimed by the Black Basta ransomware gang.

Medisund says in a data breach notification letter filed with the Office of Maine's Attorney General that it spotted the breach more than one year ago, in December 2023, after detecting suspicious activity on its network. \"Upon discovering the suspicious activity, Medusind took the affected systems offline and hired a leading cybersecurity forensic firm to conduct an investigation,\" according to the breach notice. \"Through this investigation, we found evidence that a cybercriminal may have obtained a copy of certain files containing your personal information.\" In the Maine filing , the company revealed that the December 2023 breach affected the personal and health information of 360,934 individuals. Documents exposed in the incident contained the following data types, although the impacted information varies by affected individual: Medusind offers those affected by this data breach two years of free Kroll identity monitoring services, including credit monitoring, fraud consultation, and identity theft restoration. It also warned them to keep track of their account statements for signs of potential identity theft and fraud attempts and to monitor credit reports for unauthorized or suspicious activity. These notifications come after the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) proposed updates to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) in late December 2024 to secure patients' health data following a surge in massive healthcare security breaches and data leaks affecting hospitals and Americans in recent years. These overhauled cybersecurity rules mandate healthcare organizations to encrypt Americans' protected health information (PHI), implement multifactor authentication wherever possible, and segment networks to make it harder for cybercriminals to move laterally through them. Ascension, one of the largest private U.S. healthcare systems, recently alerted nearly 5.6 million people that their data was stolen in a May cyberattack claimed by the Black Basta ransomware gang. In October, UnitedHealth confirmed the most significant healthcare breach in recent years, stemming from a February Change Healthcare ransomware attack that affected over 100 million people .

    "summary": "A hacker has taken responsibility for last week's University of Pennsylvania \"We got hacked\" email incident, saying it was a far more extensive breach that exposed data on 1.2 million donors and internal documents. On Friday, University of Pennsylvania alumni and students began receiving multiple offensive emails from Penn.edu addresses claiming the university had been hacked and data stolen. \"The University of Pennsylvania is a dog**** elitist institution full of woke retards. We have terrible security practices and are completely unmeritocratic,\" reads the email sent to Penn alumni and students. \"We hire and admit morons because we love legacies, donors, and unqualified affirmative action admits. We love breaking federal laws like FERPA (all your data will be leaked) and Supreme Court rulings like SFFA.\" BleepingComputer confirmed the emails originated from connect.upenn.edu, a Penn mailing list platform hosted on Salesforce Marketing Cloud. The university downplayed the incident, describing the messages as \"fraudulent emails\" that were \"obviously fake.\" However, the threat actor behind the attack contacted BleepingComputer, claiming the intrusion was far broader and that they had gained access to multiple university systems. The hacker said their group \"gained full access\" to an employee's PennKey SSO account, allowing access to Penn's VPN, Salesforce data, Qlik analytics platform, SAP business intelligence system, and SharePoint files. They said they exfiltrated data for roughly 1.2 million students, alumni, and donors, including names, dates of birth, addresses, phone numbers, estimated net worth, donation history, and demographic details such as religion, race, and sexual orientation. The threat actors shared screenshots and data samples with BleepingComputer and posted them online to prove that they had indeed accessed these systems and stolen data from Penn. The attackers told BleepingComputer they breached Penn's systems on October 30th and completed data downloads by October 31st, when the compromised employee account was locked and access lost. After discovering their access had been revoked, the hacker said they still had access to Salesforce Marketing Cloud and used it to send the offensive mass email to roughly 700,000 recipients. When asked whether the credentials were stolen via an infostealer or phishing, the hacker declined to elaborate, saying the intrusion was simple and caused by Penn's security lapses. The hacker has since published a 1.7-GB archive containing spreadsheets, donation materials, and other files allegedly taken from Penn's SharePoint and Box systems. The attacker told BleepingComputer they were not extorting the university, saying, \"We don't think they'd pay, and we can extract plenty of value out of the data ourselves.\" When asked about their motivation, the hackers said the attack was not political but aimed at obtaining Penn's donor database. \"While we're not really politically motivated, we have no love for these nepobaby-serving institutions,\" the hackers told BleepingComputer. \"The main goal was their vast, wonderfully wealthy donor database.\" The donor database has not yet been leaked, though the threat actors claim they may release it in a month or two. When contacted with these claims, the University of Pennsylvania told BleepingComputer, \"We are continuing to investigate.\" After publishing this story, The Daily Pennsylvanian reported that Penn has referred the security incident to the FBI. \"We understand and share our community’s concerns and have reported this to the FBI. We are working with law enforcement as well as other third-party technical resources to address this as rapidly as possible,\" stated a Penn spokesperson. With a large amount of donor data now exposed, Penn donors should stay vigilant against targeted phishing or social engineering attempts. Attackers could use the stolen information to impersonate the university, solicit fraudulent donations, or gain access to donor credentials to breach their online accounts.

    "summary": "French retailer Auchan is informing that some sensitive data associated with loyalty accounts of several hundred thousand of its customers was exposed in a cyberattack. The company is sending data breach notifications to customers affected by the incident. \"We are writing to inform you that Auchan has been the victim of a cyberattack. This attack resulted in unauthorized access to certain personal data associated with your loyalty account,\" reads the retailer's notification. According to the sample of the notice, the data exposed in the attack includes full names, title and client status, postal address, email address, phone number, and loyalty card number. The retailer underlines that bank data, passwords, and PIN numbers have not been impacted. In a statement for French media , a company representative said that data belonging to \"several hundred thousand\" of its customers was exposed containing the incident. Auchan is a French multinational retail group operating over 2,100 branches across 13 countries in Europe and Africa. The chain employs 154,000 people and has an annual revenue of over $35 billion. The company said it has notified the French Data Protection Authority (CNIL) about the data breach. In the meantime, Auchan advises letter recipients to remain vigilant for potential phishing attacks leveraging the stolen information. \"We remind you that Auchan will never ask you (whether by email, SMS, or phone) for your login details, passwords, or loyalty card PIN code,\" warned Auchan. \"If you receive such a message, do not click on any link, do not call the indicated number, and ignore the information it contains, as it is most likely a phishing attempt.\" BleepingComputer contacted Auchan several days ago to request more information about the attack, but the company has not provided a reply. The data breach at Auchan comes shortly after similar disclosures made by other large entities in France, including Air France and KLM , Orange , and Bouygues Telecom , some of which were linked to ShinyHunters' attacks on Salesforce. At this time, there's no evidence linking these attacks or suggesting a coordinated campaign targeting large businesses in the country.

The data broker also disclosed in a filing with the Maine Attorney General's Office that the resulting data breach impacted 364,333 individuals who had their personally identifiable information exposed.

    "summary": "Flagstar Bank is warning that over 800,000 US customers had their personal information stolen by cybercriminals due to a breach at a third-party service provider. Flagstar, now owned by the New York Community Bank, is a Michigan-based financial services provider that, before its acquisition last year, was one of the largest banks in the United States, having total assets of over $31 billion. A data breach notification sent to impacted customers explains that Flagstar was indirectly impacted by Fiserv, a vendor it uses for payment processing and mobile banking services. Fiserv was breached in the widespread CLOP MOVEit Transfer data theft attacks that have impacted over 64 million people and two thousand organizations worldwide, according to a report by Emsisoft . The attackers exploited a zero-day vulnerability in the MOVEit Transfer product to access Fiserv’s systems and, from there, stole Flagstar customer data the vendor held to provide services. The types of data that were compromised are redacted in the sample data breach notification letters. However, the entry on Maine’s data breach portal lists at least names and Social Security Numbers (SSNs) as stolen by the threat actors. The total number of Flagstar Bank customers impacted by this incident is 837,390 in the United States. This latest breach is the third for Flagstar since March 2021, when it disclosed it suffered a breach from the Clop ransomware gang, who, at that time, hacked its Accellion file transfer server in January of that year. Based on the data samples posted by the ransomware gang, the hackers managed to steal customer and employee information, including names, addresses, phone numbers, tax records, and SSNs. In June 2022, Flagstar disclosed another breach of its corporate network that impacted over 1.5 million of its customers in the U.S. The data compromised in that incident includes at least names and Social Security Numbers. At the time, the company opted again to censor the relevant section on the published notification samples. What is more worrying is that Fiserv offers services to hundreds of banks, which it has indirectly exposed in the past due to other security lapses. BleepingComputer has contacted Fiserv to ask if the MOVEit breach affects more financial institutions and their customers, and we will update this post as soon as we receive a response.

A&A Services, doing business as Sav-RX, is a pharmacy benefit management (PBM) company that provides prescription drug management services to employers, unions, and other organizations across the U.S. On Friday, the company notified the Maine Attorney General's office of a cybersecurity incident in October 2023 that exposed the data of 2,812,336 people. \"On October 8, 2023, we identified an interruption to our computer network. As a result, we immediately took steps to secure our systems and engaged third-party cybersecurity experts,\" reads the notification sent to impacted individuals. \"Our information technology systems (\"IT System\") were restored the next business day, and prescriptions were shipped on time without delay.\" The impact on its business operations was kept to a minimum, with no delays in the shipment of medical prescriptions or pharmacy claims. While their systems were restored in a day, investigating whether personal data was stolen took much longer. According to the data breach notification, their investigation took almost eight months and was completed on April 30, 2024, with the help of third-party experts. This investigation revealed that the hackers first accessed customer data on October 3, 2023. \"As part of the investigation, we learned that an unauthorized third party was able to access certain non-clinical systems and obtained files that contained personal information,\" informs Sav-Rx. The types of data exposed in this incident include: In a FAQ page on its site, Sav-Rx explains that it took them eight months to send out notices of breach to impacted customers because their initial priority was to minimize interruption to patient care before launching an investigation on the impact of the incident. Sav-Rx also noted that it didn't rush to conclude the investigations, striving for as accurate results as possible. It says its health plan customers (impacted organizations) were notified earlier, between April 30 and May 2, 2024. Sav-Rx then reached an agreement with its business customers to notify impacted individuals, and hence, the letters were circulated late last week. The company notes that it did not have sufficient contact information to notify some individuals in many cases, so people are urged to confirm if they're affected by calling 888-326-0815. Among the new security measures Sav-Rx implemented in response to this incident are setting up a 24/7 security operations center, implementing multi-factor authentication on critical accounts, network segmentation, enhanced geo-blocking, upgraded firewalls and switches, strengthened Linux security, and BitLocker encryption. Though the firm currently has no evidence that the stolen information was misused or disseminated on the dark web, it enclosed instructions in the letters on enrolling in a two-year credit monitoring and identity theft protection service. As the stolen data contains sensitive information that can be used for identity theft, it is strongly advised that those impacted monitor their credit reports for fraudulent activity.

    "summary": "Luxury retailer Neiman Marcus confirmed it suffered a data breach after hackers attempted to sell the company's database stolen in recent Snowflake data theft attacks. In a data breach notification filed with the Office of the Maine Attorney General, the company says that the breach impacted 64,472 people. \"In May 2024, we learned that, between April and May 2024, an unauthorized third party gained access to a database platform used by Neiman Marcus Group. Based on our investigation, the unauthorized third party obtained certain personal information stored in the database platform,\" warns Neiman Marcus in a data breach notification. \"The types of personal information affected varied by individual, and included information such as name, contact information, date of birth, and Neiman Marcus or Bergdorf Goodman gift card number(s) (without gift card PINs).\" Neiman Marcus said they disabled access to the database platform when the breach was detected, investigated with cybersecurity experts, and notified law enforcement. While gift card numbers for Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman were exposed in the breach, the data did not include PINs, so the gift cards should still be valid. In a statement to BleepingComputer, Neiman Marcus confirmed that the data was stolen from their Snowflake account. \"Neiman Marcus Group (NMG) recently learned that an unauthorized party gained access to a cloud database platform used by NMG that is provided by a third party, Snowflake,\" the Neiman Marcus Group told BleepingComputer. The data breach notifications come after a threat actor named \"Sp1d3r\" put Neiman Marcus' data up for sale on a hacking forum for $150,000, as first shared by HackManac .

While the threat actor did not mention Snowflake in the post, they included \"Raped Flake,\", which is in reference to a custom tool of the same name the threat actors created to steal data from the database platform. According to the threat actor, the stolen data included what Neiman Marcus shared, plus the last four digits of social security numbers, customer transactions, customer emails, shopping records, employee data, and millions of gift card numbers. The threat actor claims to have attempted to extort the company before the forum posting, stating that the company refused to pay an extortion demand. However, soon after the post was made on the forum, it was subsequently taken down along with the data sample, indicating that the company may have begun negotiating with the threat actors. A joint investigation by SnowFlake, Mandiant, and CrowdStrike revealed that a threat actor, tracked as UNC5537, used stolen customer credentials to target at least 165 organizations that had not configured multi-factor authentication protection on their accounts. Mandiant also linked the Snowflake attacks to a financially motivated threat actor tracked as UNC5537 since May 2024. This threat actor is known for breaching organizations, stealing data, and attempting to extort companies into paying a ransom for the data not to be published or leaked to other threat actors. While Mandiant has not publicly disclosed much information about UNC5537, BleepingComputer has learned they are part of a community of threat actors who frequently visit the same websites, Telegram and Discord servers. To breach Snowflake accounts, the threat actor used credentials stolen by information-stealing malware infections dating back to 2020. \"The impacted accounts were not configured with multi-factor authentication enabled, meaning successful authentication only required a valid username and password,\" Mandiant said. \"Credentials identified in infostealer malware output were still valid, in some cases years after they were stolen, and had not been rotated or updated.

    "summary": "Luxury retailer Neiman Marcus confirmed it suffered a data breach after hackers attempted to sell the company's database stolen in recent Snowflake data theft attacks. In a data breach notification filed with the Office of the Maine Attorney General, the company says that the breach impacted 64,472 people. \"In May 2024, we learned that, between April and May 2024, an unauthorized third party gained access to a database platform used by Neiman Marcus Group. Based on our investigation, the unauthorized third party obtained certain personal information stored in the database platform,\" warns Neiman Marcus in a data breach notification. \"The types of personal information affected varied by individual, and included information such as name, contact information, date of birth, and Neiman Marcus or Bergdorf Goodman gift card number(s) (without gift card PINs).\" Neiman Marcus said they disabled access to the database platform when the breach was detected, investigated with cybersecurity experts, and notified law enforcement. While gift card numbers for Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman were exposed in the breach, the data did not include PINs, so the gift cards should still be valid. In a statement to BleepingComputer, Neiman Marcus confirmed that the data was stolen from their Snowflake account. \"Neiman Marcus Group (NMG) recently learned that an unauthorized party gained access to a cloud database platform used by NMG that is provided by a third party, Snowflake,\" the Neiman Marcus Group told BleepingComputer.

The university discovered the attack on September 27 and disclosed one month later that it was investigating a cybersecurity incident impacting SUDPS systems. In an update published on Monday, Stanford said the attackers didn't gain access to other systems outside the Department of Public Safety's network. \"The investigation determined that an unauthorized individual(s) gained access to the Department of Public Safety's network between May 12, 2023, and Sept. 27, 2023,\" the university said .

The cybercrime group has since published the stolen data on their dark web leak site, making it available for download via BitTorrent. ​The Akira ransomware operation emerged in March 2023 and quickly gained notoriety by targeting victims across various industry verticals.

    "summary": "Almost 2.7 billion records of personal information for people in the United States were leaked on a hacking forum, exposing names, social security numbers, all known physical addresses, and possible aliases. The data allegedly comes from National Public Data, a company that collects and sells access to personal data for use in background checks, to obtain criminal records, and for private investigators. National Public Data is believed to scrape this information from public sources to compile individual user profiles for people in the US and other countries. In April, a threat actor known as USDoD claimed to be selling 2.9 billion records containing the personal data of people in the US, UK, and Canada that was stolen from National Public Data. At the time, the threat actor attempted to sell the data for $3.5 million and claimed it contained records for every person in the three countries. USDoD is a known threat actor who was previously linked to an attempted sale of InfraGard's user database in December 2023 for $50,000. BleepingComputer, at the time, contacted National Public Data and never received a response to our email. Since then, various threat actors have released partial copies of the data, with each leak sharing a different number of records and, in some cases, different data. On August 6th, a threat actor known as \"Fenice\" leaked the most complete version of the stolen National Public Data data for free on the Breached hacking forum. However, Fenice says the data breach was conducted by another threat actor named \"SXUL,\" rather than USDoD. The leaked data consists of two text files totaling 277GB and containing nearly 2.7 billion plaintext records, rather than the original 2.9 billion number originally shared by USDoD. While BleepingComputer can't confirm if this leak contains the data for every person in the US, numerous people have confirmed to us that it included their and family members' legitimate information, including those who are deceased. Each record consists of the following information - a person's name , mailing addresses , and social security number , with some records including additional information, like other names associated with the person. None of this data is encrypted. Previously leaked samples of this data also included phone numbers and email addresses, but these are not included in this 2.7 billion record leak. It is important to note that a person will have multiple records, one for each address they are known to have lived. This also means that this data breach did not impact 3 billion people as has been erroneously reported in many articles that did not properly research the data. Some people have also told BleepingComputer that their social security numbers were associated with other people they don't know, so not all the information is accurate. Finally, this data may be outdated, as it does not contain the current address for any of the people we checked, potentially indicating that the data was taken from an old backup. The data breach has led to multiple class action lawsuits against Jerico Pictures , which is believed to be doing business as National Public Data, for not adequately protecting people's data. If you live in the US, this data breach has likely leaked some of your personal information. As the data contains hundreds of millions of social security numbers, it is suggested that you monitor your credit report for fraudulent activity and report it to the credit bureaus if detected. Furthermore, as previously leaked samples also contained email addresses and phone numbers, you should be vigilant against phishing and SMS texts attempting to trick you into providing additional sensitive information.

    "summary": "U.S. doughnut chain Krispy Kreme confirmed that attackers stole the personal information of over 160,000 individuals in a November 2024 cyberattack. The American multinational coffeehouse chain employed 22,800 people in 40 countries as of December 2023 and operates 1,521 shops and 15,800 points of access. It also manages four \"Doughnut Factories\" in the United States and 37 others internationally, and it partners with McDonald's to have its products sold in thousands of McDonald's locations worldwide. This week, in a filing with Maine's Office of the Attorney General, Krispy Kreme revealed that the November data breach had affected 161,676 individuals. \"On May 22, 2025, we determined that certain of your personal information was impacted by this incident,\" it told affected individuals in breach notification letters sent to impacted people. \"There is no evidence that your information has been misused, and we are not aware of any reports of identity theft or fraud as a direct result of this incident. While the company didn't reveal what data was exposed in the incident, a separate filing with Massachusetts' Attorney General discloses that stolen documents contained affected individuals' social security numbers, financial account information, and driver's license information. Krispy Kreme detected unauthorized activity on its IT systems on November 29 and disclosed the incident , along with disruptions to its online ordering, in an SEC filing filed on December 11. The company also took measures to contain the breach and hired external cybersecurity experts to assess the attack's full impact on its operations. While Krispy Kreme has yet to share additional details regarding the November breach, the Play ransomware gang claimed responsibility for the attack in late December, saying they also stole data from the company's network. Play ransomware claimed, without proof, that the allegedly stolen files contain \"private and personal confidential data, client documents, budget, payroll, accounting, contracts, taxes, IDs, finance information,\" and more. After negotiations with the company failed, the ransomware gang released multiple archives containing hundreds of GBs of documents on its dark web leak site on December 21. The Play ransomware operation emerged in June 2022, and its operators are known for stealing sensitive data from compromised systems and using double-extortion tactics to pressure victims into paying a ransom under the threat of leaking the stolen data online. Notable victims include cloud computing company Rackspace , car retailer giant Arnold Clark , the City of Oakland in California, Dallas County , the Belgian city of Antwerp , and, most recently, American semiconductor supplier Microchip Technology . In December, the FBI issued a joint advisory with CISA and the Australian Cyber Security Centre, warning that the Play ransomware gang had breached around 300 organizations globally as of October 2023. Update June 20, 06:21 EDT: Krispy Kreme says in a notice of data breach published on its official website that documents stolen in the November ransomware attack also contain health information. \"Types of information that were subject to unauthorized access vary by individual but may include: name, Social Security number, date of birth, driver’s license or state ID number, financial account information, financial account access information, credit or debit card information, credit or debit card information in combination with a security code, username and password to a financial account, passport number, digital signature, username and password, email address and password, biometric data, USCIS or Alien Registration Number, US military ID number, medical or health information, and health insurance information,\" the company states..

    "summary": "U.S. doughnut chain Krispy Kreme confirmed that attackers stole the personal information of over 160,000 individuals in a November 2024 cyberattack. The American multinational coffeehouse chain employed 22,800 people in 40 countries as of December 2023 and operates 1,521 shops and 15,800 points of access. It also manages four \"Doughnut Factories\" in the United States and 37 others internationally, and it partners with McDonald's to have its products sold in thousands of McDonald's locations worldwide. This week, in a filing with Maine's Office of the Attorney General, Krispy Kreme revealed that the November data breach had affected 161,676 individuals. \"On May 22, 2025, we determined that certain of your personal information was impacted by this incident,\" it told affected individuals in breach notification letters sent to impacted people. \"There is no evidence that your information has been misused, and we are not aware of any reports of identity theft or fraud as a direct result of this incident. While the company didn't reveal what data was exposed in the incident, a separate filing with Massachusetts' Attorney General discloses that stolen documents contained affected individuals' social security numbers, financial account information, and driver's license information. Krispy Kreme detected unauthorized activity on its IT systems on November 29 and disclosed the incident , along with disruptions to its online ordering, in an SEC filing filed on December 11. The company also took measures to contain the breach and hired external cybersecurity experts to assess the attack's full impact on its operations. While Krispy Kreme has yet to share additional details regarding the November breach, the Play ransomware gang claimed responsibility for the attack in late December, saying they also stole data from the company's network. Play ransomware claimed, without proof, that the allegedly stolen files contain \"private and personal confidential data, client documents, budget, payroll, accounting, contracts, taxes, IDs, finance information,\" and more. After negotiations with the company failed, the ransomware gang released multiple archives containing hundreds of GBs of documents on its dark web leak site on December 21. The Play ransomware operation emerged in June 2022, and its operators are known for stealing sensitive data from compromised systems and using double-extortion tactics to pressure victims into paying a ransom under the threat of leaking the stolen data online. Notable victims include cloud computing company Rackspace , car retailer giant Arnold Clark , the City of Oakland in California, Dallas County , the Belgian city of Antwerp , and, most recently, American semiconductor supplier Microchip Technology . In December, the FBI issued a joint advisory with CISA and the Australian Cyber Security Centre, warning that the Play ransomware gang had breached around 300 organizations globally as of October 2023. Update June 20, 06:21 EDT: Krispy Kreme says in a notice of data breach published on its official website that documents stolen in the November ransomware attack also contain health information. \"Types of information that were subject to unauthorized access vary by individual but may include: name, Social Security number, date of birth, driver’s license or state ID number, financial account information, financial account access information, credit or debit card information, credit or debit card information in combination with a security code, username and password to a financial account, passport number, digital signature, username and password, email address and password, biometric data, USCIS or Alien Registration Number, US military ID number, medical or health information, and health insurance information,\" the company states..

When contacted by HIBP inquiring about the authenticity of the data, SurveyLama said that they had already notified impacted users via email, confirming the security incident. The data set contains information about 4,426,879 accounts and was added to HIBP yesterday, so impacted users should have already received an email notification. The platform said the exposed passwords were stored either in salted SHA-1, bcrypt, or argon2 hashes form, so they are not in directly usable cleartext. Though hashing adds some resistance to cracking, it is not impervious to brute-forcing, especially the passwords protected with salted SHA-1, which carries known vulnerabilities, making it susceptible to collision attacks. That said, SurveyLama account holders should reset their passwords on the service immediately and on other platforms where they might use the same credentials. Hunt told BleepingComputer he was not aware that the compromised data had been posted anywhere publicly, making the exposure currently limited.

Home Depot is the largest home improvement retailer, with more than 2,300 stores in North America and over 475,000 employees. On Thursday, a threat actor known as IntelBroker leaked limited data for approximately 10,000 Home Depot employees on a hacking forum. \"In April 2024, Home Depot suffered a data breach that exposed the corporate information belonging to 10K employees of the company,\" reads the forum post. After BleepingComputer contacted Home Depot, the company confirmed that one of its third-party SaaS vendors mistakenly exposed sample employee data. \"A third-party Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) vendor inadvertently made public a small sample of Home Depot associates' names, work email addresses and User IDs during testing of their systems,\" Home Depot told BleepingComputer. While this data is not highly sensitive, exposing only corporate IDs, names, and email addresses, it could be used by threat actors to conduct targeted phishing attacks against Home Depot employees. These phishing attacks could be designed to gather more sensitive information, such as Home Depot credentials, which could then be sold to other threat actors or used to breach the company's network to steal corporate data or deploy ransomware. For this reason, all Home Depot employees should be wary of any emails containing links to pages that request corporate credentials or other information. If one of these emails is received, it should be reported to the company's IT staff, who can verify whether it is legitimate. ​IntelBroker is a well-known threat actor who first gained notoriety by breaching DC Health Link , an organization that administers the health care plans of U.S. House members, their staff, and their families. The incident resulted in widespread media attention and a congressional hearing after the data for 170,000 affected individuals, including members and staff of the U.S. House of Representatives, was leaked.

Casio detected the incident on Wednesday, October 11, following the failure of a ClassPad database within the company's development environment. Evidence suggests that the attacker accessed customers' personal information a day later, on October 12. The exposed data includes customer names, email addresses, countries of residence, service usage details, and purchase information such as payment methods, license codes, and order specifics. Casio says that credit card information was not stored within the compromised database. As of October 18, the attackers accessed 91,921 items belonging to Japanese customers (including individuals and 1,108 educational institution customers) and 35,049 records belonging to customers from 148 countries and regions outside Japan. \"At this time, it has been confirmed that some of the network security settings in the development environment were disabled due to an operational error of the system by the department in charge and insufficient operational management,\" the company said . \"Casio believes these were the causes of the situation that allowed an external party to gain unauthorized access.\" Although the compromised database is currently \"inaccessible to external entities,\" the ClassPad.net app remains operational. Casio clarified that the hackers did not infiltrate systems beyond the compromised database within the development environment. On Monday, October 16, Casio reported the incident to Japan's Personal Information Protection Commission and is collaborating with law enforcement authorities, assisting with their breach investigation. Additionally, Casio is working with external cybersecurity and forensics experts to conduct an internal investigation to find the underlying causes of the incident and draw up countermeasures in response to the breach. In early August, a threat actor (known as thrax) claimed to have leaked over 1.2 million user records on the BreachForums cybercrime forum, allegedly stolen from a Remote Desktop Services (RDS) server with older casio.com databases. ​The allegedly stolen information contains entries up to July 2011, AWS keys, and database credentials. \"This DB is kinda old as hell, but believe it or not, this was dumped from a live RDS server today. If anyone wants the AWS keys (with some pretty juicy permissions, S3 bucket access, etc.) and database credentials, etc., DM me,\" the threat actor said. \"A user who I gave the AWS keys to has managed to find another database.

    "summary": "In today’s fast-paced organizations, end-users will sometimes try to take a shortcut. We've all been there — rushing to meet a deadline, juggling multiple tasks, or just trying to be helpful. But the reality is that letting even well-intentioned actions can come back to bite you. Picture this: an employee innocently lets a family member use their work laptop at home, thinking, \"What's the harm?\" But unbeknownst to them, their loved one accidentally downloads malware that spreads through your company's network, wreaking havoc on sensitive data and critical systems. Suddenly, that minor favor has morphed into a multimillion-dollar nightmare. It's not just a hypothetical scenario. The World Economic Forum has found that 95% of all cybersecurity incidents can be traced back to human error. Despite all the cutting-edge security technologies and ironclad protocols, the unintentional missteps of well-meaning end-users often open the door to disaster. And the cost of these blunders? According to IBM , the average global cost of a data breach in 2023 hit a staggering USD 4.45 million, a 15% increase over the past three years. That's not just a financial blow; it's a potentially business-ending event. To better understand the risks, we can examine five of the most frequent cybersecurity blunders committed by well-meaning employees. 1. Allowing unauthorized device access Proofpoint's User Risk Security Report reveals that half of working adults let friends and family members use their work devices at home. It seems harmless enough, but those loved ones could stumble upon sensitive company data or unwittingly access unsafe websites and applications. And if the unauthorized user downloads malware? Cybercriminals could gain access to corporate data, cloud applications, and storage, opening up a Pandora's box of security risks, including data breaches, intellectual property theft, and reputational damage. To address this risk, you should implement strict security controls, like password protection and two-factor authentication, and drill the importance of device sanctity into your employees' minds. A one-time onboarding security training won’t cut it; instead, introduce a comprehensive information security plan that all employees must follow and encourage team leaders to enforce cybersecurity discipline within their teams. 2. Misdelivery of sensitive information Imagine one of your end-users accidentally sending an email packed with confidential data to the wrong recipient. This is something that happens more often than you'd think, especially in industries like healthcare, where misdelivery is the most common error leading to a data breach. To prevent these mix-ups, consider requiring encryption for sensitive emails, implementing pop-up reminders for double-checking addresses, and deploying data loss prevention solutions that act as a safety net. You can have an effective password policy in place, but if your employees are reusing their passwords on less-secure personal devices, websites, and applications, then they’re still leaving the door wide open for cybercriminals. While there’s no 100% foolproof way to stop end-users from making the mistake of reusing passwords, solutions like Specops Password Policy can at least help you know if their passwords have become compromised. The solution continuously checks your Active Directory against a database of more than 4 billion unique breached passwords, alerting users to change if their found to be using a compromised password. 4. Exposing remote interfaces Remote work has also introduced a new set of challenges. IT teams often need to perform remote management tasks, but exposing administrative interfaces to the internet is like handing the keys to your kingdom to anyone with a Wi-Fi connection. To allow remote access without opening your virtual front door, you must be selective about what you expose online. Additionally, employing automated maintenance solutions will help you minimize vulnerabilities and risks. 5. Misusing privileged accounts It’s important to remember that your IT employees are humans, too, and they may take risks they know they shouldn’t. For example, it’s tempting for an IT admin to work from their privileged account even if they’re just handling everyday IT tasks — it’s convenient, and it keeps them from having to switch back and forth between their admin and user account. But that convenience comes at a steep price; if their admin account gets compromised, it's a major risk. The safest bet? Separate user accounts with limited privileges for daily work, reserving admin powers for critical tasks only. Implement the principle of least privilege (PoLP), ensuring that employees only have access to the resources and permissions necessary to perform their specific job functions. And regularly review and audit user permissions, revoking any unnecessary privileges promptly. In the end, cybersecurity is a team sport. No matter how robust your technical defenses are, your people are often the first line of defense — and your weakest link. By understanding the common pitfalls and implementing smart policies and training, you can transform your workforce from liability to asset in the battle against cyber threats. After all, when protecting your business, an ounce of prevention is worth millions in cure. Interested to know how many open risks could be lurking within your Active Directory?

The post included samples of the stolen data for 31 alleged Europcar customers, including names, addresses, birth dates, driver's license numbers, and other information. However, after contacting Europcar last night, BleepingComputer was told that the breach was fake and that the data was fabricated using artificial intelligence. \"After being notified by a threat intel service that an account pretends to sell Europcar data on the dark net and thoroughly checking the data contained in the sample, we are confident that this advertisement is false: - the number of records is completely wrong & inconsistent with ours, - the sample data is likely ChatGPT-generated (addresses don't exist, ZIP codes don't match, first name and last name don't match email addresses, email addresses use very unusual TLDs), - and most importantly: none of these email addresses are present in our database.\" As Have I Been Pwned's Troy Hunt explains, while much of the data is clearly fake, he does not believe it was created using artificial intelligence. Hunt pointed out that the email addresses do not match the usernames. For example, all usernames contain either a first or last name, but none match the full name listed in the data. The second indicator that the data is fake is that the addresses simply do not exist. For example, two of the listed customer records use the non-existent towns of \"Lake Alyssaberg, DC\" and \"West Paulburgh, PA.\" Another indicator is that the addresses and phone numbers are for regions in the U.S., yet many of the associated emails are for other countries. While Europcar told BleepingComputer they believe this data was created using AI, Hunt points out that some of the email addresses are real, appearing in previous data breaches monitored by Have I Been Pwned. Instead, Hunt believes the mention of artificial intelligence is just a hot take based on the subject's popularity and was not involved in creating this data. \"We've had fabricated breaches since forever because people want airtime or to make a name for themselves or maybe a quick buck,\" explains Hunt . \"Who knows, it doesn't matter, because none of that makes it \"AI\" and seeking out headlines or sending spam pitches on that basis is just plain dumb.\" As pointed out by security researcher NexusFuzzy , there are existing projects that allow anyone to create data that looks almost exactly like what was shared in the fake data breach samples.

Last April this year, FBCS informed of a data breach determined to have occurred between February 14 and February 26, 2024, when threat actors breached its network and stole the following details from its electronic records: The data breach was initially believed to have impacted 1.9 million people , but subsequent findings upped the tally to 3.2 million in June and, finally, 4.2 million individuals in July. The internal investigation into the incident appears to be ongoing, as FBCS recently informed additional entities that they had been impacted, including Comcast and Truist.

On June 5, 2024, a threat actor known as 'Sp1d3r' began selling a massive 3TB database allegedly containing 380 million Advance customer records, orders, transaction details, and other sensitive information. On June 19, the company confirmed the breach via a Form 8-K filing but said it only impacts current and former employees and job applicants. The incident was part of a broader campaign targeting Snowflake accounts using stolen credentials, which impacted Pure Storage , Los Angeles Unified , Neiman Marcus , Ticketmaster , and Banco Santander . Advance has completed its internal investigation into the incident and has determined that the data breach impacted 2,316,591 million people. According to the data breach notification samples shared with the authorities , the threat actors maintained unauthorized access to Advance's Snowflake environment for over a month, starting mid-April 2024. \"Our investigation determined that an unauthorized third party accessed or copied certain information maintained by Advance Auto Parts from April 14, 2024, to May 24, 2024,\" reads the notice . \"We conducted a detailed review and analysis of the affected information to determine the types of information contained therein and to whom the information relates.\" The data stolen by the attackers includes full names, Social Security numbers (SSNs), driver's licenses, and government ID numbers.

Potentially impacted individuals are advised to be vigilant for unsolicited communications, monitor their accounts closely, activate fraud alerts, and consider placing a credit freeze. The 2.3 million figure reported by Advance is a far cry from the threat actor's allegations about 380M records, and the data types confirmed to have been exposed aren't nearly as extensive as what 'Sp1d3r' offered for sale.

Consumer credit reporting giant TransUnion warns it suffered a data breach exposing the personal information of over 4.4 million people in the United States, with BleepingComputer learning the data was stolen from it's Salesforce account. TransUnion is one of the three major credit bureaus in the United States, alongside Equifax and Experian. It operates in 30 countries, employs 13,000 staff, and has an annual revenue of $3 billion. It collects and maintains credit information on over 1 billion consumers worldwide, with approximately 200 million of those based in the U.S. This information is shared with 65,000 businesses, including lenders, insurers, and employers. According to a filing submitted to the Office of the Maine AG, the breach occurred on July 28, 2025, and was discovered two days later. A sample of the notifications distributed to impacted clients earlier this week specifies that the incident involved a third-party application serving the company's consumer support operations. \"We recently experienced a cyber incident involving a third-party application serving our U.S. consumer support operations,\" reads the data breach notice . \"The unauthorized access includes some limited personal information belonging to you.\" The data exposed in this incident was \"limited\" according to the company, although what exactly it might entail hasn't been specified in the sample notification. Instead, the letter underlines that no credit reports or core credit information were exposed in this incident. TransUnion is now offering those impacted 24 months of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services. A wave of Salesforce data theft attacks has impacted numerous companies this year, including Google , Farmers Insurance , Allianz Life , Workday , Pandora , Cisco , Chanel , and Qantas . These attacks have been conducted by the Shiny Hunters extortion group , and more recently, by a cluster tracked as UNC6395 . After publishing this story, BleepingComputer confirmed with two sources, including ShinyHunters, that TransUnion's data breach is linked to these Salesforce attacks. The threat actor claims that the stolen data consists of over 13 million records, with 4.4 million records related to people in the US. A sample of the stolen data shared with BleepingComputer contains quite a lot of sensitive personal information, including names, billing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, and unredacted Social Security Numbers of TransUnion customers. The data also includes the reason for the customer transaction, such as a request for a free credit report. In addition to customer data, the threat actors also claim to have stolen customer support tickets and messages that were stored in Salesforce. BleepingComputer contacted TransUnion with further questions about this breach, and we will update this article if we receive a response. Two years ago, a threat actor claimed a data breach at TransUnion, which the company rejected , saying that the data had been stolen from a third party.

    "summary": "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has filed a lawsuit against education software company PowerSchool, which suffered a massive data breach in December that exposed the personal information of 62 million students, including over 880,000 Texans. PowerSchool is a cloud-based software solutions provider for K-12 schools and districts, with more than 18,000 customers and supporting over 60 million students worldwide. In January, the education software giant disclosed that its PowerSource customer support portal was breached on December 19, 2024, using a subcontractor's stolen credentials. The attacker demanded a $2.85 million ransom in Bitcoin on December 28, 2024, after stealing the full names, physical addresses, phone numbers, passwords, parent information, contact details, Social Security numbers, and medical data of impacted students and faculty. As BleepingComputer first reported, the threat actor behind the December 2024 PowerSchool breach claimed to have stolen the personal data of 62.4 million students and 9.5 million teachers from 6,505 school districts across the U.S., Canada, and other countries. \"PowerSchool's failures violate both the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act and the Identity Theft Enforcement and Protection Act by misleading customers about its security practices and failing to take reasonable measures to protect sensitive information entrusted by Texas families and school districts,\" the Office of the Attorney General of Texas said . \"If Big Tech thinks they can profit off managing children's data while cutting corners on security, they are dead wrong. Parents should never have to worry that the information they provide to enroll their children in school could be stolen and misused. My office will do everything we can to hold PowerSchool accountable for putting Texas students, teachers, and families at risk,\" Attorney General Paxton added on Wednesday. In a private FAQ shared with customers and reviewed by BleepingComputer at the time, PowerSchool acknowledged that it had made a ransom payment to stop the data from being disclosed and received a video from the attacker claiming that the stolen data had been erased. However, someone claiming to be ShinyHunters began individually extorting school districts in early May, threatening to release the previously stolen student and teacher data if a ransom was not paid. The leader of ShinyHunters claimed to BleepingComputer that this person was an affiliate falsely impersonating the hacking group, who attempted to re-extort PowerSchool with data stolen in an earlier September 2024 breach seen by CrowdStrike . Later that month, 19-year-old college student Matthew D. Lane from Worcester, Massachusetts, pleaded guilty to orchestrating the massive cyberattack on PowerSchool with the help of several other conspirators and attempting to extort millions of dollars in exchange for not leaking the stolen data of millions. According to school notices and a DataBreaches.net report, the ransom demands sent to school districts claimed to be from ShinyHunters , a high-profile group of threat actors linked to a wide range of breaches that had impacted hundreds of millions of people . In March, PowerSchool also published a CrowdStrike investigation into the incident, which revealed that threat actors had also breached PowerSource in August and September 2024 , using the same compromised credentials.

Slim CD is a provider of payment processing solutions that enables businesses to access electronic and card payments via web-based terminals, mobile, or desktop apps. The firm first detected suspicious activity on its systems this year on June 15.

However, Slim CD says that the threat actor viewed or obtained access to credit card information this year for two days, between June 14th and 15th \"That access may have enabled an unauthorized actor to view or obtain certain credit card information between June 14, 2024, and June 15, 2024,” Slim CD says in the data breach notification. The types of data that may have been accessed by the unauthorized part include: Though the exposed information is not enough to allow cybercriminals to perform fraudulent transactions, since the card verification number (CVV) is missing, a risk of credit card fraud still exists. Slim CD says it has taken measures to strengthen its security to prevent similar incidents in the future. At the same time, it advises the notice recipients to remain vigilant for signs of fraud and identity fraud attempts and report suspicious activity to the card issuer as soon as possible. No free-of-charge identity theft protection services were offered to the affected individuals. Slim CD offers payment processing services to various industries, including retail, hospitality, and restaurants, but individuals receiving the breach notifications are likely unfamiliar with it as they never directly interacted with the company.

    "summary": "Payment gateway provider Slim CD has disclosed a data breach that compromised credit card and personal data belonging to almost 1.7 million individuals. In the notification sent to impacted clients, the company says that hackers had access to its network for nearly a year, between August 2023 and June 2024. Slim CD is a provider of payment processing solutions that enables businesses to access electronic and card payments via web-based terminals, mobile, or desktop apps. The firm first detected suspicious activity on its systems this year on June 15. During the investigation, the company discovered that hackers had gained access to its network since August 17, 2023. “The investigation identified unauthorized system access between August 17, 2023, and June 15, 2024,” reads the notification to impacted individuals. However, Slim CD says that the threat actor viewed or obtained access to credit card information this year for two days, between June 14th and 15th \"That access may have enabled an unauthorized actor to view or obtain certain credit card information between June 14, 2024, and June 15, 2024,” Slim CD says in the data breach notification. The types of data that may have been accessed by the unauthorized part include: Though the exposed information is not enough to allow cybercriminals to perform fraudulent transactions, since the card verification number (CVV) is missing, a risk of credit card fraud still exists. Slim CD says it has taken measures to strengthen its security to prevent similar incidents in the future. At the same time, it advises the notice recipients to remain vigilant for signs of fraud and identity fraud attempts and report suspicious activity to the card issuer as soon as possible. No free-of-charge identity theft protection services were offered to the affected individuals. Slim CD offers payment processing services to various industries, including retail, hospitality, and restaurants, but individuals receiving the breach notifications are likely unfamiliar with it as they never directly interacted with the company.

The company is one of the largest telecommunication service providers in France, offering mobile, internet, and IPTV services. Bouygues Telecom has 14.5 million mobile subscribers, 9,000 employees, and an annual revenue of €56.8 billion ($66B). Bouygues Telecom confirmed in a FAQ and a press statement that the attack occurred last Sunday, August 4, 2025. Although Bouygues Telecom says that there has been no impact observed on customer services or networks, the personal data of 6.4 million customers was compromised. \"Bouygues Telecom was the victim of a cyberattack that allowed unauthorized access to certain personal data from 6.4 million customer account,\" reads the translated press statement . \"The situation was resolved as quickly as possible by Bouygues Telecom's technical teams, and all necessary additional measures have been implemented.\" A previous statement says that internal investigations confirmed that the attack was orchestrated by a 'known cybercriminal group' that targeted 'specific internal resources.' The firm informed the French National Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI) and the CNIL (French data protection authority) accordingly, noting that the perpetrator could face up to 5 years of imprisonment and a €150,000 fine for this attack. According to the FAQ, the following customer information was stolen: Importantly, the company said that no credit card numbers or Bouygues Telecom account passwords were compromised. The company has now blocked the attacker's access to its network, increased monitoring, and implemented additional security measures. Customers are being informed of the breach directly via SMS and email, but the situation has exposed them to fraud and phishing risks. Bouygues Telecom urges its customers not to give away sensitive information like their login credentials to people calling them and mentioning their name and account number to gain their trust. Although the leaked IBANs are not enough for initial transfers, impacted individuals are still advised to regularly check their debits and contact their bank immediately if they notice suspicious activity. Just last week, another French telecommunications giant, Orange, disclosed a similar network breach that occurred on July 25, 2025. Investigations to determine whether customer data was stolen are still ongoing, and the company has not published an update on this.

    "summary": "Outdoor apparel retailer The North Face is warning customers that their personal information was stolen in credential stuffing attacks targeting the company's website in April. The North Face is a major American outdoor apparel and equipment brand owned by VF Corporation that also controls Vans, Timberland, and Dickies. The North Face generates over $3 billion in annual revenue, making it one of the largest outdoor brands in the world, with its e-commerce accounting for approximately 42% of its total sales volumes. Credential stuffing attacks are a type of cyberattack where threat actors attempt to gain unauthorized access to user accounts by automating login attempts using username-password pairs previously exposed in data breaches. The technique is possible thanks to \"credentials recycling,\" which is when people use the same username and password across multiple online services. However, if the accounts are protected by multi-factor authentication (MFA), these attacks fail even if the passwords are compromised. The North Face has now begun to send data breach notifications to impacted customers, with a sample notice shared with the Vermont Attorney General that informs customers that it recently suffered a credential stuffing attack. \"On April 23, 2025, we discovered unusual activity involving our website, thenorthface.com, which we investigated immediately,\" reads the notice . \"Following a careful and prompt investigation, we concluded that an attacker had launched a small scale credential stuffing attack against our website on April 23, 2025.\" The data that has been exposed includes the following: It is noted that payment information was not exposed, as an external provider handles payments on the site, and The North Face doesn't retain anything but a token required for the process to go through. In the case of The North Face, the decision not to enforce MFA on all accounts has come at a significant cost to its customer base, as this is the fourth credential stuffing incident the brand's site has suffered since 2020. Earlier this year, its parent company, VF Outdoor, informed of a credential stuffing attack impacting 'thenorthface.com' and 'timberland.com,' discovered on March 13, 2025 . That incident exposed 15,700 accounts. Two similar incidents were disclosed in November 2020 and September 2022 , impacting over 200,000 customers.

The attacker claims to have stolen source code for D-Link's D-View network management software, along with millions of entries containing personal information of customers and employees, including details on the company's CEO. The stolen data allegedly includes names, emails, addresses, phone numbers, account registration dates, and the users' last sign-in dates. The threat actor provided samples of 45 stolen records with timestamps between 2012 and 2013, which prompted another participant in the thread to comment on the fact that the data looked very old. \"I have breached the internal network of D-Link in Taiwan, I have 3 million lines of customer information, as well as source code to D-View extracted from system,\" the attacker said. \"This does include the information of MANY government officials in Taiwan, as well as the CEOs and employees of the company.\" The data has been available for purchase on the hacking forum since October 1st, with the threat actor demanding $500 for the stolen customer information and the alleged D-View source code. D-Link said the security breach occurred due to an employee falling victim to a phishing attack, granting the attacker access to the company's network. In response to the breach, the company immediately shut down potentially impacted servers and disabled all but two user accounts used during the investigation. While it confirmed the breach, D-Link specified that the intruder accessed a product registration system within what it described as a \"test lab environment,\" operating on an outdated D-View 6 system that reached the end of life in 2015. The reason why an end-of-life server was still operational on D-Link’s network, potentially remaining exposed to Internet access for seven years, remains unclear. Contrary to the attacker's claim of stealing millions of users' data, D-Link said the compromised system contained roughly 700 records, with info on accounts that have been for at least seven years. \"Based on the investigations, however, it only contained approximately 700 outdated and fragmented records that had been inactive for at least seven years,\" D-Link said . \"These records originated from a product registration system that reached its end of life in 2015. Furthermore, the majority of the data consisted of low-sensitivity and semi-public information.\" D-Link also suspects the threat actor deliberately tampered with the recent login timestamps to create the illusion of a more recent data theft.

The healthcare services provider stated that it detected unauthorized access to its network on October 7, 2024, and subsequently discovered that the intrusion had begun on September 27. The investigation that followed revealed that the intruders had exfiltrated data from the systems they had accessed. “The investigation determined that an unauthorized actor may have accessed and copied certain files on our computer systems between September 27, 2024, and October 3, 2024,” reads the notification . “As a result, we undertook an extensive review of the involved files to determine whether they contained sensitive information and to whom the information relates.” This process took roughly ten months, as impacted individuals received notifications about the data breach only on August 25, 2025. Healthcare Services Group is a publicly traded company in Pennsylvania that specializes in providing support services to healthcare facilities across the United States. The organization has an annual revenue of $1.7 billion, and its services are of strategic importance to the safe and smooth functioning of thousands of healthcare facilities in the country. The types of data compromised in this incident, varies per individual, and may include: The organization stated that, as of now, there's no evidence of any misuse of the stolen information. HSGI offers 12 and 24-month credit monitoring and identity theft protection services coverage to individuals affected by the breach, depending on the severity of the exposed data. In addition to this, the company recommends that people remain vigilant for phishing and scamming attempts and report suspicious activity on their banking accounts to the authorities. As of writing, no ransomware groups have claimed the attack on HSGI.

    "summary": "The Healthcare Services Group (HSGI) is alerting more than 600,000 individuals that their personal information was exposed in a security breach last year. The healthcare services provider stated that it detected unauthorized access to its network on October 7, 2024, and subsequently discovered that the intrusion had begun on September 27. The investigation that followed revealed that the intruders had exfiltrated data from the systems they had accessed. “The investigation determined that an unauthorized actor may have accessed and copied certain files on our computer systems between September 27, 2024, and October 3, 2024,” reads the notification . “As a result, we undertook an extensive review of the involved files to determine whether they contained sensitive information and to whom the information relates.” This process took roughly ten months, as impacted individuals received notifications about the data breach only on August 25, 2025. Healthcare Services Group is a publicly traded company in Pennsylvania that specializes in providing support services to healthcare facilities across the United States. The organization has an annual revenue of $1.7 billion, and its services are of strategic importance to the safe and smooth functioning of thousands of healthcare facilities in the country. The types of data compromised in this incident, varies per individual, and may include: The organization stated that, as of now, there's no evidence of any misuse of the stolen information. HSGI offers 12 and 24-month credit monitoring and identity theft protection services coverage to individuals affected by the breach, depending on the severity of the exposed data. In addition to this, the company recommends that people remain vigilant for phishing and scamming attempts and report suspicious activity on their banking accounts to the authorities. As of writing, no ransomware groups have claimed the attack on HSGI. BleepingComputer has contacted the organization to learn more about the incident, and we will update this post with their response once it reaches us.

    "author": "Lawrence Abrams",
    "published": "January 1, 2024",
    "summary": "2023 was a big year for cybersecurity, with significant cyberattacks, data breaches, new threat groups emerging, and, of course, zero-day vulnerabilities. Some stories, though, were more impactful or popular with our 22 million readers than others. Below are fourteen of what BleepingComputer believes are the most impactful cybersecurity stories of 2023, with a summary of each. Genetic testing provider 23andMe suffered credential stuffing attacks that led to a major data breach, exposing the data of 6.9 million users. The company states that the attackers only breached a small number of accounts during the credential-stuffing attacks. However, the threat actors were able to abuse other features to scrape millions of individuals' data. The threat actors attempted to sell the stolen data, but after not receiving buyers, leaked the data for 1 million Ashkenazi Jews and 4,011,607 people living in Great Britain on a hacking forum. In a recent update, 23andMe told BleepingComputer that the breach impacted 6.9 million people — 5.5 million through the DNA Relatives feature and 1.4 million through the Family Tree feature. This breach has led to multiple class action lawsuits against the company for not adequately protecting data. Two Danish hosting providers were forced to shut down after a ransomware attack encrypted the majority of customer data, and data restoration was not successful. \"Since we neither can nor wish to meet the financial demands of the criminal hackers for a ransom, CloudNordic's IT team and external experts have been working intensively to assess the damage and determine what could be recovered,\" reads CloudNordic's statement (machine translated) \"Sadly, it has been impossible to recover more data, and the majority of our customers have consequently lost all their data with us.\" A hacktivist group known as Anonymous Sudan took everyone by surprise when their DDoS attacks took down the websites and services of some of the largest tech firms in the world. The group's attacks gained wide media attention when they successfully took down login pages for Microsoft's services, including Outlook , OneDrive , and the Azure portal . Over a week later, Microsoft finally confirmed that DDoS attacks caused these outages. \"Beginning in early June 2023, Microsoft identified surges in traffic against some services that temporarily impacted availability,\" confirmed Microsoft . \"Microsoft promptly opened an investigation and subsequently began tracking ongoing DDoS activity by the threat actor that Microsoft tracks as Storm-1359.\" Anonymous Sudan later targeted numerous other websites, including those for ChatGPT , Cloudflare , and U.S. government services. The increasing DDoS attacks and their impact led the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to release an advisory about these incidents. A team of researchers from British universities trained a deep learning model to steal data from keyboard keystrokes recorded using a microphone with an accuracy of 95%. When Zoom was used for training the sound classification algorithm, the prediction accuracy dropped to 93%, which is still extremely high. To mitigate these attacks, the researchers suggest users may try altering typing styles or using randomized passwords. Other defense measures include using software to reproduce keystroke sounds, play white noise, or software-based keystroke audio filters. PayPal suffered a credential stuffing attack between December 6 and December 8, 2022, allowing attackers to access 34,942 accounts. Credential stuffing is an attack where hackers attempt to access an account by trying out username and password pairs sourced from data leaks on various websites. Hackers had access to account holders' full names, dates of birth, postal addresses, social security numbers, and individual tax identification numbers. American T.V. giant and satellite broadcast provider DISH Network mysteriously went offline earlier this year, with its websites and mobile apps not working for days. DISH later confirmed that the outage was caused by a ransomware attack , with BleepingComputer first to report that the Black Basta ransomware gang was behind the attack. Employees told BleepingComputer that the ransomware gang compromised the company's Windows domain controllers and encrypted VMware ESXi servers and backups. DISH data breach notifications confirmed that data was stolen in the attack and hinted that a ransom was paid not to release the stolen data. \"We are not aware of any misuse of your information, and we have received confirmation that the extracted data has been deleted,\" read the data breach notification . Web hosting giant GoDaddy says it suffered a multi-year breach allowing unknown attackers to steal source code and install malware on its servers. This breach began in 2021 and allowed the threat actors access to the personal information of 1.2 million Managed WordPress customers, including credentials, and also used the access to redirect websites to other domains. No threat actors ever claimed responsibility for this attack. MGM Resorts International suffered a massive attack that impacted numerous systems, including its main website, online reservations, and in-casino services, like ATMs, slot machines, and credit card machines. The BlackCat ransomware operation claimed the attack, whose affiliates said they encrypted over 100 ESXi hypervisors during the incident. Bloomberg reported that the same group also breached Caesars Entertainment's network , providing a strong hint in a Form 8-K SEC filing that they paid the attackers to prevent a leak of customers' stolen data. While the attack was significant, it also brought wide attention to a loose-knit group of hackers known as Scattered Spider. Scattered Spider, also known as 0ktapus , Starfraud, UNC3944 , and Muddled Libra , is adept at social engineering and relies on phishing, multi-factor authentication (MFA) bombing (targeted MFA fatigue), and SIM swapping to gain initial network access on large organizations. Members of this collective are affiliates of the BlackCat ransomware gang and include young English-speaking members with diverse skill sets who frequent the same hacking forums and Telegram channels. While many believe this is a cohesive gang, the group is a network of individuals, with different threat actors participating in each attack. This fluid structure is what makes it challenging to track them. In November, the FBI released an advisory highlighting the group's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Scattered Spider is behind previous attacks on Reddit , MailChimp , Twilio , DoorDash , and Riot Games . 3CX was breached by the North Korean Lazarus hacking group to push malware through a supply chain attack using the company's Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) desktop client. 3CX is a VoIP IPBX software development company whose 3CX Phone System is used by more than 350,000 companies worldwide and has over 12 million daily users. 3CX was breached after an employee installed a trojanized version of Trading Technologies' X_TRADER software, which allowed the threat actors to steal corporate credentials and breach the network . The attackers pushed out a malicious software update that installed a previously unknown information-stealing malware to steal data and credentials stored in Chrome, Edge, Brave, and Firefox user profiles. In May, Barracuda disclosed that some of their Email Security Gateway (ESG) appliances were hacked using a zero-day vulnerability to install malware and steal data. We later learned that the attacks were linked to Chinese threat actors , who used the vulnerability since 2022 to infect ESG devices with new malware named 'Saltwater,' 'Seaspy,' and 'Seaside.' CISA later disclosed that Submarine and Whirlpool malware were also used in the attacks to backdoor ESG devices. What stood out from these attacks is that instead of using a software fix for impacted ESG devices, Barracuda warned customers they must replace their Email Security Gateway (ESG) appliances , which was done free of charge. \"Impacted ESG appliances must be immediately replaced regardless of patch version level,\" the company warned at the time. \"Barracuda's remediation recommendation at this time is full replacement of the impacted ESG.\" This unusual request led many to believe that the threat actors compromised the devices at a low level, making it impossible to ensure they were completely clean. Mandiant, who was part of the incident response in these attacks, told BleepingComputer that this was recommended out of caution, as Barracuda could not ensure the complete removal of malware. In February 2023, a massive ransomware campaign targeted exposed VMware ESXi servers worldwide, quickly encrypting the virtual machines for thousands of companies. Just hours after the attack, victims began reporting in the BleepingComputer's forum that files with vmxf, .vmx, .vmdk, .vmsd, and .nvram, all files associated with VMware ESXi virtual machines, were encrypted. The ransomware campaign was dubbed ESXiArgs due to an .args file being created for every encrypted file. The VMware ESXi console home page was modified to show a ransom note demanding 2.0781 bitcoins, worth approximately $49,000 at the time. One of BleepingComputer's most-read stories of the year was the news that the Brazilian National Telecommunications Agency seized incoming Flipper Zero purchases for their potential to be used in criminal activity. Brazilians who purchased the Flipper Zero reported that their shipments were redirected to Brazil's telecommunications agency, Anatel, due to a lack of certification with the country's Radio Frequencies department. From emails seen by BleepingComputer, Anatel flagged the device as a tool used for criminal purposes. In June, researchers from Kaspersky first disclosed a new zero-click iOS attack called \" Operation Triangulation \" used to install the TriangleDB spyware on iPhones. Kaspersky discovered the attack on devices within its own network, and Russia's FSB intelligence service accused Apple of providing the NSA with a backdoor. However, the true origins of the attack remain unknown, and there is no proof that the U.S. government is behind the attacks. The attacks start with the hackers sending a malicious iMessage attachment that, when processed by iOS, automatically triggers a zero-click exploit chain. A zero-click exploit means it does not require interaction from the user to be triggered. The attacks chained together four zero-day iOS vulnerabilities listed below to install the spyware: Last week, Kaspersky disclosed that the final zero-day vulnerability, CVE-2023-38606, abused an undocumented feature in Apple chips to bypass hardware-based security protections. While the Operation Triangulation attacks did not impact many devices, it could be one of the most sophisticated iOS attacks seen to date. While it's still unknown who is behind the attacks, their sophistication has led cybersecurity researchers to believe that a government-sponsored hacking group is behind them. BleepingComputer was the first to report the widespread data-theft attacks exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in the MOVEit Transfer secure file transfer platform. MOVEit Transfer is a managed file transfer (MFT) solution developed by Ipswitch, a subsidiary of US-based Progress Software Corporation, that allows the enterprise to securely transfer files between business partners and customers using SFTP, SCP, and HTTP-based uploads. While the vulnerability was patched in May 2023, the threat actors had already utilized it as a zero-day to breach MOVEit Transfer servers and download the stored data. The attacks were soon claimed by the Clop ransomware gang , who previously launched similar attacks through zero-day vulnerabilities in Accellion FTA and GoAnywhere . According to Emsisoft , 2,706 organizations were breached using this vulnerability, exposing the personal data of over 93 million people. It's budget season!

    "summary": "Framework Computer disclosed a data breach exposing the personal information of an undisclosed number of customers after Keating Consulting Group, its accounting service provider, fell victim to a phishing attack. The California-based manufacturer of upgradeable and modular laptops says a Keating Consulting accountant was tricked on January 11 by a threat actor impersonating Framework's CEO into sharing a spreadsheet containing customers' personally identifiable information (PII) \"associated with outstanding balances for Framework purchases.\" \"On January 9th, at 4:27am PST, the attacker sent an email to the accountant impersonating our CEO asking for Accounts Receivable information pertaining to outstanding balances for Framework purchases,\" the company says in data breach notification letters sent to affected individuals. \"On January 11th at 8:13am PST, the accountant responded to the attacker and provided a spreadsheet with the following information: Full Name, Email Address, Balance Owed. \"Note that this list was primarily of a subset of open pre-orders, but some completed past orders with pending accounting syncs were also included in this list.\" Framework says its Head of Finance notified Keating Consulting's leadership of the attack once he became aware of the breach roughly 29 minutes after the external accountant replied to the attacker's emails at 8:42 AM PST on January 11th. As part of a subsequent investigation, the company identified all customers whose information was exposed in the attack and notified them of the incident via email. Since the exposed data includes the names of customers, their email addresses, and their outstanding balances, it could potentially be used in phishing attacks that impersonate the company to request payment information or redirect to malicious websites designed to gather even more sensitive information from those impacted. The company added that it only sends emails from 'support@frame.work' asking customers to update their information when a payment has failed and it never asks for payment information via email. Customers are urged to contact the company's support team about any suspicious emails they receive. Framework says that from now on, all Keating Consulting employees with access to Framework customer information will be required to have mandatory phishing and social engineering attack training. \"We are also auditing their standard operating procedures around information requests,\" the company added. \"We are additionally auditing the trainings and standard operating procedures of all other accounting and finance consultants who currently or previously have had access to customer information.\" A Framework spokesperson was not immediately available for comment when BleepingComputer asked about the number of affected customers in the data breach.

Dymocks is a bookstore chain operating 65 stores in Australia, New Zealand, and Hong Kong, and also an online shop that sells printed books, e-books, stationery supplies, games, and digital media. The company was informed that its customer data was stolen on September 6th, 2023, by Troy Hunt, the creator of the data breach notification service 'Have I Been Pwned' (HIBP), after a threat actor released it on a hacking forum. In a notice posted to Dymocks' website , the book retailer explains that they see no evidence of penetration on its computer systems, and they're currently investigating a potential security breach on third-party partners. As such, how the data was obtained, the duration of unauthorized access, the extent of malicious activity, and the exact scope of the impact of this incident remain unclear. The investigation carried out by Dymocks and contracted experts has so far confirmed that the following types of customer information have been compromised: Dymocks clarified that it does not store customer financial information, so no such details have been exposed. Have I Been Pwned has confirmed that the data leaked online consists of 1.2 million user records for 836,120 unique Dymocks accounts. All relevant authorities have been notified about the incident, and Dymocks is currently working towards completing its investigation and implementing additional security measures to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future. Also, Dymocks assures clients that it is still safe to make purchases on its online shop. However, it recommends that users change their account password. Troy Hunt reports that Dymocks customer data has been circulated in various Telegram channels and hacking forums since at least June 2023. That said, cybercriminals had plenty of opportunity to exploit the leaked dataset in phishing and scamming attacks targeting the bookstore's clients. BleepingComputer has found a post on one of the BreachForums hacking forum's latest reboots posted on September 3rd, 2023, offering access to the stolen database to other forum members for a few dollars. While it does not appear that passwords were exposed in the Dymocks data breach, it is strongly advised that users change their passwords on the site to be safe. Furthermore, if the same password was used at other sites, it should also be changed there. When changing your passwords, use a unique and strong password at every site so that a data breach does not affect your account at other companies. A password manager can make it much easier to use unique passwords at every site and is highly recommended. Finally, as this data was essentially released for free, Dymocks customers should be on the lookout for emails asking for a credit card or login information, as it could be targeted phishing scams resulting from this data breach.

    "summary": "Have I Been Pwned warns that an alleged data breach exposed the personal information of 56,904,909 accounts for Hot Topic, Box Lunch, and Torrid customers. Hot Topic is an American retail chain specializing in counterculture-related clothing, accessories, and licensed music merchandise. The company operates over 640 stores across the United States and Canada, primarily located in shopping malls, and has a vast customer base. According to HIBP , the exposed details include full names, email addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, physical addresses, purchase history, and partial credit card data for Hot Topic, Box Lunch, and Torrid customers. The security incident was initially claimed on BreachForums by a threat actor named \"Satanic\" on October 21, 2024. The threat actor claimed to have stolen 350 million user records from Hot Topic and its related brands, Box Lunch and Torrid. \"Satanic\" was attempting to sell the database for $20,000 while also demanding a ransom payment of $100,000 from Hot Topic to remove the listing from the forums. At the time, BleepingComputer contacted Hot Topic to ask about the authenticity of the data but received no response. A report from HudsonRock published on October 23 suggested that the breach may have originated from an information stealer malware infection that stole credentials for a data unification service used by Hot Topic. While Hot Topic has remained silent, and no notifications were sent to potentially impacted customers, data analytics firm Atlas Privacy reported last week that the 730GB database actually impacts 54 million customers. Additionally, Atlas clarified that the dataset contains 25 million credit card numbers encrypted with a weak cipher that's easy to break using modern computers. Although Atlas is not 100% certain the database belongs to Hot Topic, it noted that nearly half of all email addresses were not seen in previous breaches, further supporting the legitimacy of the threat actor's claims. Altas says the breach appears to have occurred on October 19, and the data spans from 2011 until that date. The firm has set up a site that allows Hot Topic customers to check if their email address or phone number is exposed in the data leak. Meanwhile, the threat actor continues to sell the database, albeit at a lower price of $4,000. Potentially impacted Hot Topic customers should stay vigilant for phishing attacks, monitor their financial accounts closely for suspicious activity, and change their passwords on every platform where they use the same credentials. BleepingComputer has contacted Hot Topic again requesting a comment, but we have not heard back by publication time. It's budget season!

    "summary": "Have I Been Pwned warns that an alleged data breach exposed the personal information of 56,904,909 accounts for Hot Topic, Box Lunch, and Torrid customers. Hot Topic is an American retail chain specializing in counterculture-related clothing, accessories, and licensed music merchandise. The company operates over 640 stores across the United States and Canada, primarily located in shopping malls, and has a vast customer base. According to HIBP , the exposed details include full names, email addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, physical addresses, purchase history, and partial credit card data for Hot Topic, Box Lunch, and Torrid customers. The security incident was initially claimed on BreachForums by a threat actor named \"Satanic\" on October 21, 2024. The threat actor claimed to have stolen 350 million user records from Hot Topic and its related brands, Box Lunch and Torrid. \"Satanic\" was attempting to sell the database for $20,000 while also demanding a ransom payment of $100,000 from Hot Topic to remove the listing from the forums. At the time, BleepingComputer contacted Hot Topic to ask about the authenticity of the data but received no response. A report from HudsonRock published on October 23 suggested that the breach may have originated from an information stealer malware infection that stole credentials for a data unification service used by Hot Topic. While Hot Topic has remained silent, and no notifications were sent to potentially impacted customers, data analytics firm Atlas Privacy reported last week that the 730GB database actually impacts 54 million customers. Additionally, Atlas clarified that the dataset contains 25 million credit card numbers encrypted with a weak cipher that's easy to break using modern computers. Although Atlas is not 100% certain the database belongs to Hot Topic, it noted that nearly half of all email addresses were not seen in previous breaches, further supporting the legitimacy of the threat actor's claims. Altas says the breach appears to have occurred on October 19, and the data spans from 2011 until that date. The firm has set up a site that allows Hot Topic customers to check if their email address or phone number is exposed in the data leak. Meanwhile, the threat actor continues to sell the database, albeit at a lower price of $4,000. Potentially impacted Hot Topic customers should stay vigilant for phishing attacks, monitor their financial accounts closely for suspicious activity, and change their passwords on every platform where they use the same credentials. BleepingComputer has contacted Hot Topic again requesting a comment, but we have not heard back by publication time.

    "summary": "The Akira ransomware group is targeting small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) - 80% of its victims , since March 2023, have been SMBs. According to Arctic Wolf , the groups ransom demand ranges between $200,000 USD to over $4 million USD. If the organizations refuse to pay, the gang threatens to expose names and data. According to the same source, most intrusions leveraged compromise credentials to obtain initial access. Akira is just one example of the growing security problem for SMBs. While breaches at enterprises may grab the headlines, 56% of SMBs had cyberattacks last year. SMBs are attractive targets for cybercriminals. They typically have fewer resources like IT support, and lack robust security procedures, like employee cybersecurity training. Hackers also target SMBs to find entry points to larger enterprises. Many of the largest breaches in recent years were the result of third-party attacks that started with a smaller company that was digitally connected to another. In 2023, we’ve seen multiple breaches of SMBs that turned into large-scale attacks on major companies, including AT&T , Chic-fil-A , and 1Password . A successful breach can cause significant damage. Globally, the average cost to recover from a data breach is $4.45 million, according to IBM’s Cost of a Data Breach Report 2023 — a 15% increase over the past three years. For SMBs, the average cost of a data breach is nearly $150,000 . Indirect costs can also be significant. Breaches can undermine customer trust and damage reputations. Data may be lost forever. Even when the ransom is paid, nearly 40% of companies are unable to restore their data . Businesses should use best practices for cybersecurity, such as adopting the cybersecurity framework for SMBs developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). According to the framework, SMBs can mitigate risks by: These best practices can help reduce unauthorized access. However, 98% of cyber attacks start with some form of social engineering. If threat actors get their hands on an end-user's valid passwords, they can bypass many of these security measures. So, it is not only crucial to pay close attention to password policies, but to also block known compromised passwords. Enforcing a password policy that helps end-users create stronger passwords and blocks the use of weak and common phrases will make it more difficult for hackers. However, this must go beyond requiring basic password compliance requirements. Specops data shows that 83% of compromised passwords satisfied both length and complexity requirements of regulatory password standards. Password attacks are often successful because users are predictable. They tend to reuse passwords and use similar patterns when creating passwords and trying to meet the complexity requirements. For example, starting with a common word and then following it with a number or special character. Robust password policy enforcement can help users create easy-to-remember, but hard-to-crack passphrases. MFA reduces the risk of account takeovers by adding an additional layer of protection . Even if passwords are compromised, unauthorized users can’t access your network without the second authorization, such as a push notification sent to mobile devices or third-party identity verification providers. This helps mitigate the risk of stolen credentials and brute-force password hacking. The easiest way for cybercriminals to access networks is by using compromised credentials. At any one time, more than 24 billion user names and passwords are for sale on the dark web. You can significantly reduce your risk by blocking the use of known compromised passwords with Specops Password Policy with Breached Password Protection. Conduct password audit scans of your Active Directory with Specops Password Auditor to check end-user accounts against 950 million compromised passwords and other password related vulnerabilities. This is a free read only scan that can help your organization proactively identify password vulnerabilities in multiple reports. 88% of data breaches can be traced back to human error , according to a joint study between a Stanford University researcher and Tessian. The World Economic Forum’s Global Risk Report puts that figure at 95%. SMBs should require end-user training to help them better understand importance of following cybersecurity policies and recognizing the signs of phishing, smishing, and other attacks aimed at stealing their credentials and falling victim of ransomware. SMBs can start enhancing their security posture by protecting their frontline.

Viamedis and Almerys provide healthcare and insurance services in France with technological and administrative solutions to facilitate transactions. They manage the sensitive data of policyholders required for granting reimbursements and generally streamline the payment process in France's complex, multi-layered insurance coverage system. Viamedis first disclosed the cybersecurity incident one week ago on LinkedIn (the company's website remains down), saying that it suffered a data breach impacting beneficiaries and healthcare professionals. The company said the exposure includes names, dates of birth, insurer details, social security numbers, marital status, civil status, and guarantees open to third-party payment. No banking information, email addresses, postal details, or telephone numbers were exposed, as Viamedis said it does not store this type of data on the breached systems. The company serves 20 million insured individuals through the 84 healthcare organizations that use its services, but it opted not to disclose how many of them were impacted by the incident, saying that this is under investigation. The breach on Almerys was initially reported by local news outlets citing anonymous sources, and the firm is yet to release an official statement on the incident. However, the data protection authority in France (CNIL) has now confirmed both data breaches and says that the attacks impacted 33 million people in the country. \"The CNIL was informed by Viamedis and Almerys of the cyberattack they fell victim to at the end of January,\" reads the announcement . \"These operators, who manage the third-party payment for supplementary health insurance, saw the data necessary for their missions compromised during this breach. In total, this data leak concerns more than 33 million people.\" This makes the incident one of the most impactful cyberattacks in the country's recent history, impacting nearly half its entire population. Although the exposed data does not include financial info, it is still enough to raise the risk of phishing scams, social engineering, identity theft, and insurance fraud for the exposed individuals. CNIL states that it will ensure that Viamedis and Almerys inform impacted persons directly and individually, as required by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). If you suspect you are among the impacted, it is advisable to keep a close eye on your accounts and treat incoming communications, especially solicitations concerning health insurance cost reimbursements, with suspicion. \"Although contact data was not affected by the breach, it is possible that the data involved in the breach could be combined with other information from previous data leaks,\" warns CNIL.

Workday's customer list comprises over 11,000 organizations across a diverse range of industries, including more than 60% of the Fortune 500 companies.

These attacks are believed to have begun at the start of the year, with the threat actors tricking the targets' employees into linking a malicious OAuth app to their company's Salesforce instances through social engineering attacks. Once linked, the attackers use the connection to download and steal the companies' databases, with the stolen data later being used to extort the victims via email.

Avery is an American company that produces and sells self-adhesive labels, apparel branding elements, and printing services. In a data breach notification sent to impacted customers, Avery discovered they were attacked on December 9, 2024. Following an internal investigation by digital forensic experts, it was discovered that threat actors had planted a card skimmer on 'avery.com,' the company's online shop domain, on July 18, 2024.

The organization is Oklahoma's largest not-for-profit healthcare network, operating hospitals, clinics, and emergency care units across the state. On December 26, 2023, the organization confirmed it suffered a cyberattack after patients started receiving extortion emails informing that their sensitive personal information. Unless Integris Health met the attacker's demands, the stolen data would be sold to other cybercriminals on January 5, 2024. The threat actor told BleepingComputer that their attack did not involve encryption and they only stole the data. This did not cause any network interruption and allowed Integris Health to keep providing its services to patients. The emails the patients received from the threat actor contained accurate information and linked to a website in the Tor network hosting the stolen details, but access was not free. Visitors could pay $50 and trust the attacker's word on removing the details, or pay $3 to view information belonging to any other impacted individual. Integris published last week a notification confirming that the incident impacted patient data, which included the following details: The organization clarified that the leaked data did not involve employment information, driver's licenses, account credentials (usernames and passwords), or financial information. Talking to BleepingComputer, the threat actor said that they are selling on a dark web marketplace data for 2.3 million Integris patients (based on the number of social security numbers in the database). In a new entry today, the U.S. Department of HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) portal shows that the number of impacted Integris Health patients is 2,385,646 . Integris Health says all affected patients will receive individual notifications, and recipients should remain vigilant to spot and report identity theft and fraud attempts early. The organization has published a FAQ in the form of a PDF where victims can find some additional information regarding the incident, how it impacts them, and what protective steps they can take. It is worth noting that the deadline the threat actor set for Integris Health to pay a ransom has long passed and it is very likely that the stolen data has been sold or share with other cybercriminals, who could use it for various scams, phishing, or other types of attacks.

    "summary": "Dell is warning customers of a data breach after a threat actor claimed to have stolen information for approximately 49 million customers. The computer maker began emailing data breach notifications to customers yesterday, stating that a Dell portal containing customer information related to purchases was breached. \"We are currently investigating an incident involving a Dell portal, which contains a database with limited types of customer information related to purchases from Dell,\" reads a Dell data breach notification shared with BleepingComputer. \"We believe there is not a significant risk to our customers given the type of information involved.\" Dell states that the following information was accessed by the threat actor during the breach: The company stresses that the stolen information does not include financial or payment information, email addresses, or telephone numbers and that they are working with law enforcement and a third-party forensics firm to investigate the incident. BleepingComputer contacted Dell on Wednesday to learn more about the breach and how many people it impacted but was told they \"are not disclosing this specific information from our ongoing investigation.\" As first reported by Daily Dark Web , a threat actor named Menelik attempted to sell a Dell database on the Breach Forums hacking forum on April 28th. The threat actor said they stole data from the computer maker for \"49 million customer and other information systems purchased from Dell between 2017-2024.\" While BleepingComputer has not been able to confirm if this is the same data that Dell disclosed, it matches the information listed in the data breach notification. The Breach Forum's post has since been deleted from the site, which could indicate that another threat actor purchased the database. Dell does not \"believe there is significant risk to our customers given the type of information involved,\" yet the stolen information could potentially be used in targeted attacks against Dell customers. As the stolen information does not include email addresses, threat actors could target specific people with physical mailings with phishing links or that contain media (DVDs/thumb drives) to install malware on targets' devices. While this may sound far-fetched, threat actors have conducted similar attacks in the past, physically mailing tampered Ledger hardware wallets that stole cryptocurrency or sending gifts with USB drives that installed malware . As the database is no longer being sold, there is a good chance a threat actor is attempting to monetize it in some way through attacks. Therefore, be wary of any physical mailings or emails you receive that claim to be from Dell asking you to install software, change passwords, or perform some other potentially risky action.

London-based Finastra provides financial services software applications to more than 8,100 financial institutions across 130 countries, including 45 of the world's top 50 banks. As the company warned in breach notification letters sent to those impacted by the breach, the security incident was first detected on November 7 after Finastra identified malicious activity on some of its systems. \"Our investigation revealed that an unauthorized third party accessed a Secure File Transfer Platform (SFTP) at various times between October 31, 2024 and November 8, 2024. Findings from the investigation indicate that on October 31, 2024, the unauthorized third party obtained certain files from the SFTP,\" the fintech giant said. \"Finastra has no indication the unauthorized third party further copied, retained, or shared any of the data. We have no reason to suspect your information has or will be misused. As a result, we believe the risk to individuals whose personal data was involved is low.\" While Finastra has yet to share the number of individuals affected by the data breach and the nature of the exposed data (besides victims' names), the company started sending breach notification letters last week to at least 65 people in the state whose financial account information was stolen (according to filings with the Attorney General's office in Massachusetts). The financial services company also provides two years of free credit monitoring and identity restoration services through Experian to those whose information was exposed or stolen in the attack. Although Finastra disclosed very limited information in filings with Attorney General offices, the breach is believed to be linked to a (now-deleted) post made by a threat actor known as \"abyss0\" on the BreachForums online cybercrime community claiming to sell 400GB of data allegedly stolen from Finastra's network . ​When BleepingComputer asked about the forum post in November, a Finastra spokesperson would neither confirm nor deny if the data belonged to the company, only saying that they had suffered a limited-scope security breach and were evaluating its impact. \"On November 7, 2024 Finastra's Security Operations Center (SOC) detected suspicious activity related to an internally hosted Secure File Transfer Platform (SFTP) we use to send files to certain customers,\" Finastra told BleepingComputer. Finastra was also forced to take some of its systems offline in March 2020 to contain what Tom Kilroy, the company's Chief Operating Officer at the time, described as a ransomware attack. While the company didn't share how the attackers gained access to its systems, cyber threat intelligence firm Bad Packets found that Finastra had multiple Pulse Secure VPN and Citrix ADC (NetScaler) unpatched servers before the attack.

Finastra was also forced to take some of its systems offline in March 2020 to contain what Tom Kilroy, the company's Chief Operating Officer at the time, described as a ransomware attack. While the company didn't share how the attackers gained access to its systems, cyber threat intelligence firm Bad Packets found that Finastra had multiple Pulse Secure VPN and Citrix ADC (NetScaler) unpatched servers before the attack. A Finastra spokesperson was not immediately available for comment when contacted by BleepingComputer earlier today to provide more details on the October 2024 data breach. It's budget season!
