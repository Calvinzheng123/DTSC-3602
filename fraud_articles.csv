Google Ranks Phishing Above Keyloggers & Password Reuse as Bigger Threat to Users,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-ranks-phishing-above-keyloggers-and-password-reuse-as-bigger-threat-to-users/,Catalin Cimpanu,"November 9, 2017","Research carried out by Google engineers and academics from the University of California, Berkeley and the International Computer Science Institute has revealed that phishing attacks pose a more significant threat to users losing access to their Google accounts when compared to keyloggers or password reuse. Researchers reached these results after studying and analyzing data from multiple black markets peddling access to user accounts and user credentials. The study examined data advertised on these black markets between March 2016 and March 2017. The research team says it found over 788,000 credentials stolen via keyloggers, 12.4 million credentials stolen via phishing, and 1.9 billion credentials exposed by third-party breaches. From all the data researchers collected, they said that 12% of all records they found exposed via breaches at other services were for accounts registered via Gmail addresses. For 7% of these accounts registered with Gmail addresses, the user had also reused his Google password at the other account, putting both in danger. Despite this finding, Google said that data sold by hackers who claimed they obtained it via phishing kits and keyloggers contained many more valid passwords. Depending on the type of phishing kit or keylogger the crook had used, these datasets contained between 12% and 25% valid Google passwords. Google also said it used the results of this study to reset passwords for affected accounts. ""By ranking the relative risk to users, we found that phishing posed the greatest threat, followed by keyloggers, and finally third-party breaches,"" Google researchers said. ""We find victims of phishing are 400x more likely to be successfully hijacked compared to a random Google user. In comparison, this rate falls to 10x for data breach victims and roughly 40x for keylogger victims,"" the research team added. In addition, researchers also spotted a rising trend in keyloggers and phishing kits, which are now logging IP addresses and other geolocation data in an attempt to fool geo-based protection filters, while other more complex attack kits also log phone numbers and user-agent string data. A summary of the study's more important findings is below: The research team presented their study at the Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS).

Highly Sensitive Details of 143 Million Users Stolen in Equifax Hack,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/highly-sensitive-details-of-143-million-users-stolen-in-equifax-hack/,Catalin Cimpanu,"September 8, 2017","Equifax — one of the largest providers of consumer credit reporting and other financial services in the US — said last night it was the victim of a hack during which attackers made off with details on over 143 million of its customers. While the amount of stolen data is impressive in its size alone, affected users have real reasons for concern because of the nature of the data hackers made off with. According to a press release the company put out, attackers stole names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and, in some instances, driver's license numbers. Furthermore, hackers also accessed credit card numbers for approximately 209,000 US users and dispute documents with personal identifying information for approximately 182,000 more. In addition, Equifax said attackers also had limited access to the personal details of UK and Canadian residents but did not reveal the number of affected users. In most breaches, hackers get access to limited information, such as names, addresses, or credit card numbers. A breach of this magnitude and depth of sensitive information is a rare event, and a dangerous one. Any hacker holding the information stolen from Equifax can very easily build in-depth profiles on its targets and carry out fraudulent transactions, illegal tax returns, hijack online accounts, and more. Equifax made another big mistake by not notifying users right away. The company said it detected the hack on July 29, but waited more than a month to issue a public warning so users could freeze their assets or take precautionary measures. ""This is a disastrous data breach, probably one of the most detrimental breaches of this year, capable of undermining trust in an already quite fragile online financial space,"" Ilia Kolochenko, CEO and Founder of High-Tech Bridge told Bleeping Computer via email. ""Such a delayed public disclosure of the breach is quite dubious. Probably the disclosure was reasonably postponed in the interests of investigation, but it still could endanger the victims,"" Kolochenko added. Rick Smith, Equifax CEO, apologized for the incident in a YouTube video (see below) and offered to provide free credit monitoring services for one year to all US citizens, not just those affected by the breach. If you think the offer is generous, it is not. The 143 million figure is about 45% of the US' entire population, but if excluding children, the elderly and other inactive age groups, that's a large chunk of the active credit-eligible population anyway, meaning most US consumers were affected regardless. Equifax has set up a web page where affected users can verify if they're included in the reported data breach. They can also use this website to enroll in free credit monitoring services. Users included in the breach have a higher priority and can sign up and receive the free credit monitoring offer right away. Users not included in the breach will receive their one-year free credit monitoring service but from a later date. In the meantime, Equifax encourages these users to sign up for a commercial plan of credit monitoring services, just in case. In other words, Equifax is using its own hack to sell credit card monitoring services. The marketing blunder comes to complete the numerous other technical failures. For example, Equifax's breach verification site uses a stock WordPress site , hardly the best technology for running secure sites. Because it allows users to verify if they're in the breach by checking their name and last six digits of their SSN, the site quickly got flagged by OpenDNS as a phishing site . When it launched, the site also had SSL issues , which also contributed to OpenDNS marking the site as a threat. The primary Equifax website is also still vulnerable to an XSS flaw reported last year. One of the Equifax login pages shows debug codes that could be useful in gaining an idea about how Equifax's internal network works. In its official statement, Equifax said the intrusion took place after ""criminals exploited a U.S. website application vulnerability to gain access to certain files."" With such a clumsy effort on the technical side, it is no wonder that LinkedIn's CISO (Chief Information Security Officer) wanted to lay low. Susan Mauldin, Equifax's CISO, suddenly doesn't have a LinkedIn page https ://t.co/E5VnqDhrxB The good news is that Equifax is hiring new staff to bolster its security department, but it may bee just too late [ 1 , 2 ]. Besides expecting a visit from the FTC and ambulance chasing lawyers holding class-action lawsuits in their hands, Equifax should also expect the SEC. Shortly after the data breach press release was published, Bloomberg reported that three Equifax high-ranking execs were allowed to sell company stock of nearly $1.8 million. The date of this transaction came after the company discovered the data breach. In statements to the press, Equifax said the execs who sold their stock were not aware of the breach, an explanation that few are experts are buying. Weird how Equifax pr can't say whether users' SSNs were encrypted but knows that execs were unaware of a huge hack weeks after it happened. https://t.co/PsjtSeOob2 Just so we are all clear here https ://t.co/h6xgKHE76J pic.twitter.com/5mHqQYhWCW Equifax stock ( NYSE:EFX ) is expected to plummet when the US stock market opens on Friday, later today.

"12,449 Data Breaches Confirmed in 2018, a 424% Increase Over the Previous Year",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/12-449-data-breaches-confirmed-in-2018-a-424-percent-increase-over-the-previous-year/#comment_form,Sergiu Gatlan,"March 6, 2019","The number of confirmed data breaches during 2018 reached 12,449, a 424% increase when compared with 2017, 47% of all compromised identity records having been exposed in breaches experienced by organizations from the United States and China. 4IQ, the identity intelligence company which published this report on the breached data landscape and trends, also discovered that, while the number of breaches saw a substantial boost last year, the average breach sized decreased to 216,884 records, a value 4.7 times smaller than the year before. The company defines data breaches as confirmed incidents ""where credentials, personal, medical, financial or other records with sensitive data have been accessed or disclosed due to being hacked or leaked, either deliberately or by accident."" The report also unearths the fact that crooks also switched their attention from harder to infiltrate large organizations and corporations to the less protected small businesses, a trend which also contributed to the massive four times increase in the number of breaches detected during 2018. While on the whole United Stated data breaches haven't been as numerous as the ones from other countries, the size of the breaches contributed heavily to the large number of identity records being exposed throughout the year as part of US incidents, roughly 32% of the total number of curated records detected in such incidents around the world. 2018 also saw an important 71% jump in underground activity , with 14.9 billion raw identity stolen records being circulated and exchanging hands, although only 3.6 billion of them were new and authentic. ""As our personal data continues to get exposed and circulated in underground markets, the problem of identity-based attacks is only growing,"" said 4iQ CEO Monica Pal. Also, ""Consumers need to do what they can to prevent problems, like enable two-factor authentication, use a password manager, etc. but then they also need to take a proactive approach to protect themselves by signing up for identity theft protection services which include exposure alerts and help with remediation and insurance."" In addition, ""Government was the largest growing exposed sector in 2018, increasing over 291 percent from 2018,"" said 4iQ co-founder and CTO Julio Casal. ""This may be the result of mid-term elections and increasing geopolitical tensions. For the first time, we saw underground brokers actively including citizen data, such as voter databases , as part of their data portfolio."" 2018 was also the year of Internet-connected data storage devices left exposed for everyone to access , which could translate into a more careful approach during 2019, with companies and organizations being more careful when securing their databases. 4iQ also highlights the same big data breaches impacting large companies that led to millions of identity records being exposed per incident : 2018 saw companies like Google, Facebook, and Marriott make headlines as well. With new breaches being reported on an almost daily basis, “breach fatigue” has set in, with their occurrence becoming the “new normal.” 4iQ's 2019 Identity Breach Report uses data assembled from a far-reaching collection of both leaked and breached data obtained from open sources available on the surface, deep and dark web, as well as from black markets, social media, and underground forums and communities. This data was collected with the help of automated crawlers and it was analyzed by the company's breach-hunting team using data curation and verification methodology and tools.

Hacker selling 550 million stolen user records on hacking forum,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacker-selling-550-million-stolen-user-records-on-hacking-forum/,Lawrence Abrams,"May 14, 2020","A threat actor is selling twenty-nine databases on a hacker forum that allegedly contains a combined total of 550 million stolen user records. The actor began selling these databases on May 7th, when they posted them on a well-known hacker where threat actors can buy each one individually. According to cyber intelligence firm Cyble , none of these data breaches appear to be new, with the oldest being from 2012 and the latest from last month. The sheer volume of user accounts for sale is concerning as the information exposed could be used to perform large-scale credential stuffing or targeted phishing attacks. In addition to the combined total of 550 million user records, a database of 47.1 million phone numbers that were part of a 2018 Dubsmash data breach is being sold as well. Below are the various databases that were put up for sale and how many records each allegedly contains. For many of the databases being sold, they include millions of already cracked passwords, which will make a purchaser's job much easier when buying them for credential stuffing attacks. If you have an account at any of the above-breached sites and have not changed it since the breach date, it is strongly suggested that you change your password to be safe. If you do not know when you last set your password, change it to be safe. You can also see if your email was part of these breaches by checking at Cyble's amibreached.com data breach lookup service.

The password attacks of 2023: Lessons learned and next steps,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-password-attacks-of-2023-lessons-learned-and-next-steps/#comment_form,Home,"December 20, 2023","It should take more than eight characters to bring a business to a halt. However, the relentless onslaught of password-based cyber attacks underscores the alarming ease with which cybercriminals can exploit vulnerable credentials to inflict damage. Password attacks take many forms: from phishing schemes that dupe employees into handing over their login information, to underground markets where bad actors can sell or purchase stolen credentials. Either way, having a valid password allows bad actors to do everything from stealing data to taking over critical business systems. In fact, nearly half (49%) of incidents cited in Verizon's 2023 Data Breach Investigations Report involved compromised passwords. The password attacks of 2023 involved the following high-profile brands: Best known for its genetic testing and ancestry services, 23andMe disclosed that a hacker was offering to sell names, location, and other data that could cover half of its 14 million users. This incident was attributed to credential stuffing, where guessing login credentials or using credentials stolen from other sources are used to gain unauthorized access. It may be known as a provider of antivirus protection, but the vendor found its own security compromised following the discovery of a credential stuffing attack. The incident involved the company's own Norton Lifelock Password Manager. Norton said the incident involved close to a million customers, of whom 6,500 had data compromised . In late August, the online charity that helps divert reusable goods from landfills sent out an urgent request asking members to change their passwords . In an online form, a hacker claimed the breach included up to seven million accounts, with details such as user IDs, e-mails and hashed passwords. The organization said the attack may have begun years ago when a server was exposed, adding that changing credentials was particularly important if members are using the same ones for other services. While the exact steps of a security incident response will vary somewhat depending on the extent of a breach, some of the best practices to minimize the damage include: 1. Issuing a 'Reset All Passwords' directive Blocking access to cybercriminals will prevent further repercussions from the initial breach. This means sending clear communication to all employees and customers to immediately change their passwords . Businesses can simplify this process for their employees through a self-service password reset tool to minimize calls to the helpdesk. 2. Having an incident response team If you haven't already walked through the steps to handling a cybersecurity incident, you'll need to bring the appropriate stakeholders together to develop an action plan. This usually includes the IT department, legal counsel, and even marketing communications teams who'll inform affected parties. You may also need to bring on third-party help to conduct digital forensics to understand the full scope of the attack's impact. 3. Notifying those whose personal information has been compromised Effective data breach disclosure needs to be comprehensive and clear, with next-best steps included. Make sure you've compiled answers to the most anticipated questions and provide simple mechanisms where people can contact you for more details. Advise on any recommendations to safeguard information, such as the password reset directive described above. Defending your business against password attacks isn't a matter of reinventing the wheel. Many businesses simply need to apply some of the standard protective measures. This starts with education. Employees should be regularly trained in password security and informed about the dangers of using the same passwords across multiple services. Given that cybercriminals may be buying or selling lists of previously compromised credentials, businesses should also build routine monitoring to ensure they're not at risk. Tools like Specops Password Policy , which continuously scans your Active Directory for compromised passwords, allows businesses to move from reactive to proactive password security. Passwords provide a key to some of the most valuable information and systems in the world. With the right technologies and procedures, businesses can improve their ability to ensure those keys don't fall into the wrong hands. Sponsored and written by Specops Software .",0.5653413534164429
Robinhood discloses data breach impacting 7 million customers,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/robinhood-discloses-data-breach-impacting-7-million-customers/,Lawrence Abrams,"November 8, 2021","Stock trading platform Robinhood has disclosed a data breach after their systems were hacked and a threat actor gained access to the personal information of approximately 7 million customers. The attack occurred on November 3rd after a threat actor called a customer support employee and used social engineering to obtain access to customer support systems. After accessing the support systems, the threat actor was able to access customer information, including full names, email addresses, and for a limited number of people, data of birth, and zip codes. ""At this time, we understand that the unauthorized party obtained a list of email addresses for approximately five million people, and full names for a different group of approximately two million people,"" disclosed a blog post published today about the security incident. ""We also believe that for a more limited number of people—approximately 310 in total—additional personal information, including name, date of birth, and zip code, was exposed, with a subset of approximately 10 customers having more extensive account details revealed."" In summary, the data breach exposed: The company states that they do not believe any Social Security numbers, bank account numbers, or debit card numbers were exposed in the attack. After learning of the attack and securing their systems, RobinHood also received an extortion demand. While Robinhood has not provided any details regarding the extortion demand, it was likely a threat that the stolen data would be leaked if a Bitcoin ransom was not paid. RobinHood says they continue to investigate the incident with the help of Mandiant, a well-known cybersecurity firm commonly used to perform incident response after attacks. ""As a Safety First company, we owe it to our customers to be transparent and act with integrity,"" said Robinhood Chief Security Officer Caleb Sima. ""Following a diligent review, putting the entire Robinhood community on notice of this incident now is the right thing to do."" In 2019, Robinhood recommended users reset all of their passwords after it was discovered they were stored in their system in human readable format , otherwise known as clear text. While Robinhood did not detect any unauthorized access to these passwords, it could have allowed employees to see customers' passwords. If you are affected by this data breach or are simply concerned about the safety of your account, Robinhood suggests you take the following steps: With this latest incident, passwords were not exposed, as the threat actor had access to internal systems, it would not hurt to change your password to be extra cautious. BleepingComputer has reached out to RobinHood and will update the story if more details become available. This is a developing story.

In data breach notifications filed with the Office of Maine's Attorney General, Coinbase said, ""a small number of individuals, performing services for Coinbase at our overseas retail support locations, improperly accessed customer information."" While the exposed data did not include the impacted people's passwords, seed phrases, private keys, or other information that could be used to access their funds or accounts, it did include a combination of personal identifiers such as name, date of birth, last four digits of social security numbers, masked bank account numbers and some bank account identifiers, addresses, phone number, and email address. Depending on the affected customer, the stolen information can also contain images of government identification information (e.g., driver's license number, passport number, national identity card number) and account information (including transaction history, balance, transfers, account opening date). ""Attackers seek out this information because they want to conduct social engineering attacks, using this information to appear credible to try and convince victims to move their funds,"" Coinbase warned. The disclosure comes after many have voiced their concern that this incident could lead to serious consequences, including physical harm, after cybercriminals gain access to the account balances and addresses of impacted Coinbase customers affected by this data breach. On Thursday, Coinbase disclosed the data breach in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that the threat actors behind this attack obtained customer data of up to 1% of Coinbase's customer base with the help of support staff or contractors outside the United States. The attackers also sent an email on May 11 attempting to extort a $20 million ransom payment in exchange for not releasing the stolen information online. However, the crypto exchange said it would not pay the ransom but would establish a $20 million reward fund for tips that could help find the attackers who coordinated this attack and bring them to justice. While Coinbase is still assessing the breach's financial impact and the number of customers who were tricked into sending funds to the attackers in follow-up social engineering attacks is still unknown, the company said the resulting expenses will likely be ""within the range of approximately $180 million to $400 million"" for remediation and customer refunds. ""Coinbase will voluntarily reimburse retail customers who mistakenly sent funds to the scammer as a direct result of this incident prior to the date of this post, following a review to confirm the facts,"" the company said. Coinbase advises customers to be cautious of scammers impersonating their employees, who may try to obtain funds or sensitive information like passwords or 2FA codes.

As Ascension revealed in breach notification letters sent to affected individuals in April, their information was stolen in a data theft attack that impacted a former business partner in December. Depending on the impacted patient, the attackers could access personal health information related to inpatient visits, including the physician's name, admission and discharge dates, diagnosis and billing codes, medical record number, and insurance company name. They could also gain access to personal information, including name, address, phone number(s), email address, date of birth, race, gender, and Social Security numbers (SSNs). ""On December 5, 2024, we learned that Ascension patient information may have been involved in a potential security incident. We immediately initiated an investigation to determine whether and how a security incident occurred,"" Ascension said . ""Our investigation determined on January 21, 2025, that Ascension inadvertently disclosed information to a former business partner, and some of this information was likely stolen from them due to a vulnerability in third-party software used by the former business partner."" While Ascension didn't reveal the total number of affected individuals at the time, an April 29 filing said that the incident impacted 114,692 individuals in Texas, and the company also told Massachusetts' Office of the Attorney General that 96 residents had their medical records and SSNs exposed in the incident. However, the healthcare giant also disclosed in an April 28 filing with the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) that wasn't published until today that the data breach affected 437,329 individuals. ​Ascension offers two years of free identity monitoring services to those impacted by this incident, including credit monitoring, fraud consultation, and identity theft restoration. Although Ascension didn't share any details regarding the breach affecting its former business partner, the timeline of the breach implies that the attack was part of widespread Clop ransomware data theft attacks that exploited a zero-day flaw in Cleo secure file transfer software. Last year, Ascension notified almost 5.6 million patients and employees that their personal, financial, insurance, and health information had been stolen in a May 2024 Black Basta ransomware attack . After the incident, the healthcare organization revealed that the ransomware breach resulted from an employee downloading a malicious file onto a company device. Following the May 2024 attack, employees were forced to keep track of procedures and medications on paper, as patients' electronic records couldn't be accessed. Ascension also had to pause some non-emergent elective procedures, tests, and appointments and redirect emergency medical services to unaffected healthcare units to prevent triage delays. Ascension has over 142,000 employees, operates 142 hospitals and 40 senior care facilities acoss North America, and reported revenues of $28.3 billion in 2023.

Retail chain Hot Topic hit by new credential stuffing attacks,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/retail-chain-hot-topic-hit-by-new-credential-stuffing-attacks/,Sergiu Gatlan,"March 28, 2024","American retailer Hot Topic disclosed that two waves of credential stuffing attacks in November exposed affected customers' personal information and partial payment data. The Hot Topic fast-fashion chain has over 10,000 employees in more than 630 store locations across the U.S. and Canada, the company's headquarters, and two distribution centers. In credential stuffing attacks, cybercriminals use automated tools to trigger millions of login attempts using a list of username and password pairs. The technique is particularly effective when users reuse the same login information across multiple platforms. Breach notification letters sent to potentially impacted customers this week reveal that attackers targeted Hot Topic Rewards accounts in automated attacks using login information obtained from an unknown source. ""We determined that unauthorized parties launched automated attacks against our website and mobile application on November 18-19 and November 25, 2023, using valid account credentials (e.g., email addresses and passwords) obtained from an unknown third-party source,"" Hot Topic said. ""Based on our investigation to date, we are not able to determine which, if any, accounts were accessed by unauthorized third parties as opposed to legitimate customer logins during the relevant time periods."" Sensitive information that could've been exposed on compromised accounts includes affected customers' names, email addresses, order histories, phone numbers, months and days of birth, and mailing addresses. Hot Topic says that breached Rewards accounts would have only allowed the attackers to access partial payment data, specifically the last four digits of the card number. The retail chain worked with external cybersecurity experts after the November attacks to deploy bot protection software that should block such attacks in the future. Hot Topic will also require customers who receive the data breach notifications to set a new password to prevent other threat actors from hijacking their Hot Topic web or mobile accounts. This notification comes after five other waves of credential attacks targeted Hot Topic customers last year on February 7, March 11, May 19-21, May 27-28, and June 18-21.

Andrea Koos, American Airlines' Sr. Manager for Corporate Communications told BleepingComputer after the article was published that the employees' accounts were compromised in a phishing campaign but refused to reveal how many customers and employees were affected, instead saying that it was a ""very small number."" ""American Airlines is aware of a phishing campaign that led to the unauthorized access to a limited number of team member mailboxes. A very small number of customers and employees’ personal information was contained in those email accounts,"" Koos said. ""While we have no evidence that any personal information has been misused, data security is of the utmost importance and we offered customers and team members precautionary support. We are also currently implementing additional technical safeguards to prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future."" American Airlines was also hit by a data breach in March 2021 when global air information tech giant SITA confirmed that hackers breached its servers and gained access to the Passenger Service System (PSS) used by multiple airlines worldwide, including American Airlines. As the world's largest airline by fleet size (more than 1,300 aircraft in its mainline), American Airlines has more than 120,000 employees and operates almost 6,700 flights daily to roughly 350 destinations in over 50 countries.

"MyDeal data breach impacts 2.2M users, stolen data for sale online",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mydeal-data-breach-impacts-22m-users-stolen-data-for-sale-online/,Lawrence Abrams,"October 17, 2022","Woolworths' MyDeal subsidiary has disclosed a data breach affecting 2.2 million customers, with the hacker trying to sell the stolen data on a hacker forum. MyDeal is an Australian retail marketplace that connects online shoppers with local retailers. Retail giant Woolworths purchased 80% of the company in September but said their systems are on a completely different platform and unaffected by the incident. Last Friday, MyDeal stated that it suffered a breach after a hacker used compromised user credentials to access the company's Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system, allowing the threat actor to view and export customer information. The company says that 2.2 million customers were impacted by the data breach, with information such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, delivery addresses, and in some cases, birth dates exposed in the attack. For 1.2 million customers, only the email addresses were exposed in the breach. However, MyDeal states that no payment information, government IDs, or account passwords were exposed. MyDeal has already begun to send data breach notifications to affected customers and say that customers who do not receive one were not affected. On Sunday, the hacker behind the MyDeal breach began selling the stolen data on a hacking forum for $600. The hacker claims that the data currently consists of 1 million entries but that the number of exposed customers will increase as they finish parsing the database. As proof of their attack, the threat actor released screenshots of what they claim are the company's Confluence server and a single-sign-on prompt for the company's AWS account. Today, the threat actor released samples of the stolen data, exposing the personal information of 286 alleged MyDeal customers. While MyDeal said that no passwords were exposed in the attack, it is suggested that you err on the side of caution and reset your passwords anyway. As it is common for threat actors to purchase stolen data to use in their own attacks, all MyDeal customers should also be on the lookout for targeted phishing attacks.

""Ticketmaster recently discovered that an unauthorized third party obtained information from a cloud database hosted by a third-party data services provider,"" reads a data breach notification shared with the Office of the Maine Attorney General. ""Based on our investigation, we determined that the unauthorized activity occurred between April 2, 2024, and May 18, 2024. On May 23, 2024, we determined that some of your personal information may have been affected by the incident. We have not seen any additional unauthorized activity in the cloud database since we began our investigation."" Ticketmaster says that the breach exposed customers' names, basic contact information, and ""<extra>"" information, which is different depending on the user. The company recommends customers ""remain vigilant"" against identity theft and fraud and has offered one year of free identity monitoring to track their credit history. While Ticketmaster lazily said the breach only impacted more than 1000 people ("">1000""), it actually impacted millions of customers worldwide and exposed what many would consider much more sensitive information. Last month, a threat actor known as ShinyHunters began selling stolen data from Live Nation/Ticketmaster, claiming it contained the personal information and credit card information of 560 million users. The threat actors used compromised Ticketmaster credentials that did not have multi-factor authentication enabled to steal the data from their Snowflake account. Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehousing company used by the enterprise to store databases, process data, and perform analytics. ShinyHunters began selling the data on May 28 on a well-known hacking forum for $500,000. The threat actor claimed that the data was 1.3TB and contained information for 560 million customers, ticket sales, event information, customer fraud, and partial credit card information. Samples of the data seen by BleepingComputer contained more than just ""basic contact information,"" including full names, email addresses, phone numbers, addresses, hashed credit card details, and payment amounts. After remaining silent for days, Ticketmaster eventually confirmed the breach on May 31, in a Friday evening SEC filing, stating that they did not believe the breach would have a material impact on their company. Ticketmaster's breach is one of many recent data theft attacks linked to the Snowflake database platform. A joint investigation by SnowFlake, Mandiant, and CrowdStrike revealed that a threat actor, tracked as UNC5537, used compromised customer credentials to target at least 165 organizations that had not configured multi-factor authentication protection on their accounts. To breach Snowflake accounts, the threat actor used credentials stolen by information-stealing malware infections dating back to 2020. Recent breaches linked to these attacks include Neiman Marcus , Santander , Ticketmaster , QuoteWizard/LendingTree , Advance Auto Parts , Los Angeles Unified , and Pure Storage .

Fashion giant Chanel hit in wave of Salesforce data theft attacks,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fashion-giant-chanel-hit-in-wave-of-salesforce-data-theft-attacks/#comment_form,Lawrence Abrams,"August 4, 2025","French fashion giant Chanel is the latest company to suffer a data breach in an ongoing wave of Salesforce data theft attacks. Chanel says the breach was first detected on July 25th after threat actors gained access to a Chanel database hosted at a third-party service provider, as first reported by WWD . The breach only impacted customers in the United States and exposed personal contact information. ""Based on the findings of the investigation, the data obtained by the unauthorized external party contained limited details of a subset of individuals who contacted our client care center in the U.S. —specifically name, email address, mailing address and phone number,"" a Spokesperson told WWD. ""No other information was contained in the database. The clients affected have been informed."" While Chanel has not replied to our emails and the name of the third-party service provider was not mentioned, BleepingComputer has learned that it was stolen from the company's Salesforce instance. This attack has been attributed to the ongoing wave of Salesforce data-theft attacks conducted by the ShinyHunters extortion group. As first reported by Mandiant, threat actors have been actively targeting Salesforce customers in vishing (voice phishing) attacks to compromise credentials or to trick employees into authorizing a malicious OAuth app with their organization's Salesforce portal. Once they gain access to the Salesforce instance, they exfiltrate the database and use it as leverage in extortion demands on customers. In a statement to BleepingComputer, Salesforce emphasized that its platform was not compromised, but rather, customers' accounts are being breached in social engineering attacks. ""Salesforce has not been compromised, and the issues described are not due to any known vulnerability in our platform. While Salesforce builds enterprise-grade security into everything we do, customers also play a critical role in keeping their data safe — especially amid a rise in sophisticated phishing and social engineering attacks,"" Salesforce told BleepingComputer. ""We continue to encourage all customers to follow security best practices, including enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA), enforcing the principle of least privilege, and carefully managing connected applications. For more information, please visit: https://www.salesforce.com/blog/protect-against-social-engineering/ ."" The threat actors have not publicly leaked the data for any companies to date, with companies currently extorted via email.

Topps.com Sports Collectible Site Exposes Payment Info in MageCart Attack,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/toppscom-sports-collectible-site-exposes-payment-info-in-magecart-attack/,Lawrence Abrams,"February 27, 2019","Last week, the sports trading card and collectible company Topps issued a data breach notification stating that it was affected by an attack, which possibly exposed the payment and address information of its customers. This type of attack is called a MageCart attack, which is when attackers hack a site to inject a malicious script into a site's checkout or cart pages. When a visitor enters their payment and address information, this script will copy the submitted data and send it to a remote server for the attackers to collect. According to the data breach notification, on December 26th, 2018, Topps became aware of an unauthorized third-party that had hacked their site. Upon further investigation, it was discovered that these intruders added a malicious script that was active from November 19, 2018 to January 9, 2019. As part of this attack, Topps has stated that it is possible that customer information such as names, addresses, email address, and payment information may have been obtained by the attackers. ""It is possible that this incident compromised names, mailing addresses, telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, and payment information (including credit/ debit number, card expiration date, and security code) for customers who completed a purchase through the Topps website between November 19, 2018 and January 9, 2019,"" Topps stated in their data breach notification . ""Based on our investigation, we have no reason to believe that information for customers who completed a purchase through PayPal was affected."" On January 9th, 2019, Topps upgraded the software used to run their site and removed the malicious script. For customers who had used Topps.com between November 19th, 2018 through January 9th, 2019, it is advised that you monitor your credit history for identity theft and your credit card statements for fraudulent charges. It is also suggested that you contact your credit card company and alert them to this breach. After reading the data breach notice it became apparent that this breach was caused by a MageCart attack. BleepingComputer contacted Yonathan Klijnsma , a security researcher for RiskIQ, to see if he had any information on a MageCart attack against the Topps.com site. Klijnsma has confirmed that the Topps.com site was affected by a MageCart attack during the time periods indicated in the breach notice. ""We can confirm the dates Topps provided, additionally we have some insights into what the skimming looked like and who performed this attack. Topps was breached by a group we call Magecart Group 4, we documented them in our “Inside Magecart” report last November."" In a screenshot provided to BleepingComputer, it is shown that JavaScript was being used to inject a malicious script from http://creditprop.com/checkout. When loaded, this script would capture any payment information entered into the site and send it to a remote site where it could be collected by the attackers. Unfortunately, there is no clear-cut solution that can be given to web site owner on protecting themselves from MageCart attacks. Klijnsma has told BleepingComputer in the past that the best way to prevent MageCart attacks is to ""protect yourself from any kind of web attack."" This includes making sure your web servers and the software running on them have the latest security updates, implement subresource integrity (SRI) so that modified scripts are not loaded without your permission, and try to host third-party scripts on your own servers rather than on third-party servers.

The data breach was discovered when an ethical hacker responsibly disclosed the vulnerability to Capital One on July 17th 2019. After performing an internal investigation of whether this vulnerability had been used in the past, Capital One discovered that an unauthorized used had access their systems and customer data between March 22nd and 23rd of 2019 ""On July 19, 2019, we determined there was unauthorized access by an outside individual who obtained certain types of personal information relating to people who had applied for credit card products and Capital One credit card customers"", Capital One stated in a data security incident notice . ""This occurred on March 22 and 23, 2019."" Their investigation discovered that the unauthorized user was able to access the information for 100 million people in the United States and 6 million people in Canada. After fixing the vulnerability used in the breach, they provided information to the FBI who arrested the suspected hacker. While no credit card account numbers or login credentials were accessed, a wide range of other information was accessed. ""The largest category of information accessed was information on consumers and small businesses as of the time they applied for one of our credit card products from 2005 through early 2019. This information included personal information Capital One routinely collects at the time it receives credit card applications, including names, addresses, zip codes/postal codes, phone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, and self-reported income. Beyond the credit card application data, the individual also obtained portions of credit card customer data, including: No bank account numbers or Social Security numbers were compromised, other than: For our Canadian credit card customers, approximately 1 million Social Insurance Numbers were compromised in this incident."" Capital One will be notifying each user who was affected by email and will be providing free credit monitoring service. Due to the amount of personal information that was exposed and how it can be used for identity theft, it is strongly advised that users monitor their credit reports for suspicious activity and immediately report anything detected to both the police, Capital One, and the credit agencies. It is also strongly suggested that you freeze your credit report if you were affected to make it more difficult for bad actors to fraudulently take out credit in your name. A Seattle person named Paige Thompson was arrested by the FBI in connection to the hack of Capital One's systems. A press release by the Department of Justice states that a security researcher became suspicious after Thompson allegedly posted a comment on GitHub about her accessing Capital One's data and reported it to Capital One. ""According to the criminal complaint, THOMPSON posted on the information sharing site GitHub about her theft of information from the servers storing Capital One data,"" the DOJ announcement stated . ""The intrusion occurred through a misconfigured web application firewall that enabled access to the data. On July 17, 2019, a GitHub user who saw the post alerted Capital One to the possibility it had suffered a data theft. After determining on July 19, 2019, that there had been an intrusion into its data, Capital One contacted the FBI. Cyber investigators were able to identify THOMPSON as the person who was posting about the data theft. This morning agents executed a search warrant at THOMPSON’s residence and seized electronic storage devices containing a copy of the data. "" According to the New York Times , Thompson was the organizer of a Meetup group called the Seattle Warez Kiddies that was for anybody ""with an appreciation for distributed systems, programming, hacking, cracking, scripting, electronics, Linux, etc. "" Investigators stated that she went by the online alias “erratic"" and law enforcement was able to verify her identity after she posted an image of a veterinarian invoice. The full DOJ complaint can be read here . After seeing what large data breach announcements have done to the stock prices for other companies, Capital One is using the security incident notice to allay the fears of their investors. According to Capital One this incident is expected to generate costs of approximately $100 to $150 million in 2019 due to customer notifications, free credit monitoring services, security improvement costs, and legal fees. ""We expect the incident to generate incremental costs of approximately $100 to $150 million in 2019. Expected costs are largely driven by customer notifications, credit monitoring, technology costs, and legal support. We expect to accrue the costs for customer notification and credit monitoring in 2019. The expected incremental costs related to the incident will be separately reported as an adjusting item as it relates to the Company's financial results. "" Even with these increased costs, Capital One states that they have cyber security insurance that will cover up to $400 million with a $10 million deductible. With this said they are trying to reassure investors that this breach will not have much affect on their bottom line and are ""affirming its existing efficiency guidance, which in all cases is net of adjustments.""

In a new data breach notification published today, MoneyGram now says that the threat actors had access to its network even earlier, between September 20 and 22, 2024. During this time, the threat actors stole a varied amount of sensitive customer information, including transaction information, email addresses, postal addresses, names, phone numbers, utility bills, government IDs, and social security numbers. ""The impacted information included certain affected consumer names, contact information (such as phone numbers, email and postal addresses), dates of birth, a limited number of Social Security numbers, copies of government-issued identification documents (such as driver's licenses), other identification documents (such as utility bills), bank account numbers, MoneyGram Plus Rewards numbers, transaction information (such as dates and amounts of transactions) and, for a limited number of consumers, criminal investigation information (such as fraud),"" reads the data breach notification first spotted by TechCrunch . MoneyGram says the amount and type of data stolen vary depending on the affected customer. The specific information stolen from a customer will likely be listed in data breach notifications sent to impacted individuals.

Credential stuffing is a type of attack where threat actors make use of large collections of username/password combinations that were leaked in previous security breaches to gain access to user accounts on other online platforms. Such attacks work particularly well against users who reuse their credentials for multiple online accounts on several sites. Their end goal is to gain access to as many accounts as possible onto the targeted site and to steal sensitive information, steal money, or take over the identities of the account owners. The attackers were able to gain access to various types of personal information stored on customers' accounts at thenorthface.com according to a notice of data breach sent to affected clients. Potentially impacted information that may have been accessed via compromised accounts includes but is not limited to customers' names, birthdays, telephone numbers, billing and shipping addresses, purchased or favorited products, and email preferences. ""The perpetrator was not able to view any credit or debit card numbers, expiration data, nor CVVs, because that information is not kept on copy on thenorthface.com,"" a company spokesperson told BleepingComputer. ""The site only stores a 'token' which cannot be used to initiate purchases anywhere other than thenorthface.com."" While the breach notification sent to impacted users does not mention it, an official statement hints at the fact that, in some cases, ""unauthorized purchases"" were also made on thenorthface.com. ""We have offered full refunds for any unauthorized purchases on thenorthface.com, and all customers who could have been impacted were sent official notification,"" BleepingComputer was told.

""As a further precaution, we disabled all passwords from accounts that were accessed during the timeframe of the attack,"" customers were also told. The North Face also deleted all tokens associated with customer payment cards for all thenorthface.com accounts. Impacted users will be asked to enter their payment information again and create new passwords next time they visit the company's online store. ""Please change your password at thenorthface.com and at all other sites where you use the same password,"" The North Face says in the breach notification later. ""In addition, we recommend avoiding using easy-to-guess passwords."" ""We strongly encourage you not to use the same password for your account at thenorthface.com that you use on other websites, because if one of those other websites is breached, your email address and password could be used to access your account at thenorthface.com.""

The domains were seized following a joint law enforcement operation in coordination with the National Police Corps of the Netherlands and the Federal Police of Belgium. This international law enforcement action also resulted in the arrest of a suspect, seizures of server infrastructure, and searches at several locations. The FBI and the US DOJ also announced the seizure of the WeLeakInfo.com domain in January 2020, used in similar cybercrime activity. Just as WeLeakInfo.to, it also offered subscriptions, allowing customers to search 12 billion indexed records for specific information exposed in thousands of data breaches. As part of the 2020 WeLeakInfo seizure, two suspects believed to have made £200,000 from its operation were arrested in Ireland and Netherlands. ""These seizures are prime examples of the ongoing actions the FBI and our international partners are undertaking to disrupt malicious cyber activity,"" FBI Special Agent in Charge Wayne A.

Credit card info of 1.8 million people stolen from sports gear sites,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/credit-card-info-of-18-million-people-stolen-from-sports-gear-sites/,Bill Toulas,"December 17, 2021","Four affiliated online sports gear sites have disclosed a cyberattack where threat actors stole credit cards for 1,813,224 customers. While not much is known about the attack, a law firm representing the four websites stated that personal information and credit card information, including full CVV, were stolen on October 1st, 2021. The affected websites are the following: The sites first learned of the breach on October 15th, and after an investigation, confirmed on November 29th the customers that had their payment information stolen. The details that have been compromised as a result of this incident are the following: After the conclusion of the investigation, the websites sent notices to the affected individuals on December 16th, 2021. None of the published notices to impacted customers provide any details on the nature of the incident, so the actual means of obtaining the data remains unknown. However, as the description states, ""External system breach (hacking),"" this appears close to be a database breach rather than the implantation of card skimmers on the websites, although both scenarios are likely. Whatever the case is, if you have purchased anything from these four websites, you should treat incoming communications with vigilance, monitor your bank account and credit card statements, and report any suspicious transactions immediately. ""Upon becoming aware of the incident, Tackle Warehouse took the measures referenced above. We also reported the incident to the payment card brands in an attempt to prevent fraudulent activity on the affected accounts,"" reads Tackle's notification letter to customers. ""We also reported the incident to law enforcement and have worked closely with the digital forensics firm to enhance the security of our sites to facilitate safe and secure transactions."" Unfortunately, the affected customers have not been offered an identity protection service this time, even though the compromised data is extremely sensitive information.

Jason’s Deli says customer data exposed in credential stuffing attack,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/jasons-deli-says-customer-data-exposed-in-credential-stuffing-attack/,Bill Toulas,"January 23, 2024","Jason's Deli is warning of a data breach in notifications sent to customers of its online platform stating that their personal data was exposed in credential stuffing attacks. Jason's Deli is an American restaurant chain with 246 branches in 29 states, employing over 6,000 people and having an annual revenue of over $400 million. In a data breach notification sent to customers, Jason's Deli says hackers obtained credentials of member accounts at Jason's Deli from other sources and, on December 21, 2023, used them in a credential stuffing attack against the restaurant's website. ""On December 21, 2023, we learned that an unauthorized party had obtained an unknown number of Deli Dollar and online account login credentials (usernames and passwords) most likely from other data breaches or other sources not involving Jason's Deli,"" reads the notice . ""These unauthorized parties apparently used these login credentials to determine if they matched those of our reward and online accounts."" The effectiveness of this attack depends on whether the impacted users have set the same credentials across multiple online services and platforms, aka ""password recycling,"" making their account susceptible to hijacking. Furthermore, these types of attacks can be mitigated through IP address rate-limiting. The amount of data exposed in these credential stuffing attacks depends on the type of information a Jason's Deli member has added to their online profiles and may include the following: Jason's Deli says it detected those attempts for unauthorized access but cannot determine how many accounts have been impacted. ""We do not know the number of accounts that the unauthorized party was able to access, but out of an abundance of caution, we are sending this notice to all potentially affected account holders,"" reads the data breach notification from Jason's Deli. According to a listing at the Office of the Maine Attorney General, the total number of potentially impacted customers is 344,034 people. People confirmed as impacted will receive a password reset prompt urging them to choose a new, complex password. If you are among them, note that you should also change your passwords on all online platforms where you might be using the same credentials and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) where available. The company also said that, where applicable, Deli Dollars reward points used without authorization from breached accounts would be restored so customers would not experience losses.

VisionDirect Data Breach Caused by MageCart Attack,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/visiondirect-data-breach-caused-by-magecart-attack/,Lawrence Abrams,"November 19, 2018","VisionDirect, a popular contact lens online merchant in Europe, has posted an advisory stating that their web site had a data breach that led to the theft of credit card and account information. According to the notification, account and payment information entered on the site between November 3rd and November 8th could have been captured and sent to attackers. This data includes all account information such as billing addresses, phone numbers, and credit card information. ""The personal information was compromised when it was being entered into the site and includes full name, billing address, email address, password, telephone number and payment card information, including card number, expiry date and CVV,"" stated the advisory . VisionDirect stated that Paypal payment credentials would not have been stolen. This attack only affected visitors who logged into their accounts and entered or updated their account information during the affected period. Users who simply visited the site or used store billing information would not have been affected. VisionDirect said they will be contacting all affected customers in the next few days. This data breach was caused by a MageCart attack, which is when attackers add malicious JavaScript to a site that captures payment and account information when it is entered into a form or submitted. In this particular attack, a script was added various VisionDirect domains that pretended to be Google Analytics. That's exactly what it was. The data was stolen via a fake Google Analytics script: https://g-analytics[.]com/libs/1.0.16/analytics.js – you can view a copy of the JS via the @urlscanio archive of https://t.co/TV22dxvCcK https://t.co/SFi5Wp4gm3 pic.twitter.com/rY13cMR2TL While the script looks very similar to the normal Google Analytics code, the domain g-analytics[.]com is not actually owned by Google. Instead this domain is owned by the attackers who use it to store the stolen credit card and account information. Security researcher Willem de Groot told BleepingComputer that he had discovered this domain being used in MageCart attacks in early September. ""In this case, the breach is related to several payment exfiltration domain that we saw earlier, such as g-statistic .com, google-anaiytic .com, msn-analytics .com"" De Groot further stated that even though the advisory only mentions visiondirect.co.uk, domains for other countries were also affected. It wasn't just UK. Also infected between Nov 3rd and Nov8th: https://t.co/fQy7WsKmfq https://t.co/8JUn9frF9v https://t.co/WBCPQOIv46 https://t.co/DCyaQzuTkM https://t.co/pwfBvDWZDz https://t.co/q9of3VMPZ5 https://t.co/LclCV3VvHY https://t.co/Ouge4ebR7v https://t.co/85sRXtC50m While the script is heavily obfuscated, one portion containing a list of strings used by the script was easily decoded. In the below script you can see various strings that are being monitored such as payment, checkout, admin, login, password, account, and cart submissions. Recently we reported on the Infowars.com's online store also being compromised with a MageCart attack. In that attack, the malicious script was also masquerading as Google Analytics but used the domain google-analyitics[.]org instead. While the attack method is similar, the script itself is quite different. When BleepingComputer asked De Groot if there was any connection between these attackers and the one who targeted InfoWars, he said there was no way to conclude that they were same group. ""Could be, but I have not found other commonalities so far,"" De Groot told BleepingComputer. ""They certainly use different type of malware. Sorry, I see it would be nice if you could link them up. But cannot say for sure."" Alex Jones, the owner of Infowars, felt that his attackers were Communist China, ""Big Tech"", and the U.S. Democratic party.

Rising healthcare breaches driven by hacking and unsecured servers,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/rising-healthcare-breaches-driven-by-hacking-and-unsecured-servers/,Ionut Ilascu,"February 17, 2021","2020 was a bad year for healthcare organizations in the U.S., which had to deal with a record-high number of cybersecurity incidents on the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic. Hacking and IT incidents affected the industry to a larger extent last year, accounting for more than 67% of all breaches and exposed the personal data of tens of millions of individuals. Analyzing data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, threat protection company Bitglass found that the count of healthcare breaches reported in 2020 increased to 599, a jump of more than 50% compared to the previous year (386). Most of the breaches were caused by hacking and IT incidents, which exposed data from 24.1 million individuals, making them vulnerable to identity theft and phishing attacks. However, despite the rise in incidents, the total number of affected individuals is slightly lower compared to 2019. A breakdown of the breaches per state shows that California had the highest number, 49 incidents, followed by Texas with 43. New York with 39 breaches, and Florida and Pennsylvania, each with 38 breaches, take the next three spots. Looking at the states that had the largest count of individuals affected, Michigan ranks first, mostly because of a single incident at the Trinity Health healthcare delivery system , which impacted 3.3 individuals. According to the Ponemon Institute, breaches affecting healthcare organizations are the most expensive to deal with and have the longest recovery time. On average, the cost per breached record in 2020 was $499, and recovery took about 236 days. Also on the downside is the fact that healthcare institutions take 96 days to identify a breach, more than any other industry. While the report from Bitglass does not break down the hacking incidents by their type, ransomware attacks likely account for a significant proportion. Maze, Ryuk, REvil (Sodinokibi), SunCrypt, Snake, and Clop are just some of the ransomware groups that attacked hospitals and healthcare organizations. A report from Check Point earlier this year named Ryuk and REvil the top threats for the healthcare sector at a global level. At the end of October 2020, the U.S. Government released a warning about Ryuk ransomware attacks targeting hospitals and healthcare providers. An earlier notification, in April, sounded the alarm about ransomware groups breaching hospitals by exploiting a remote execution vulnerability in Pulse Secure VPN servers. News about ransomware hitting various hospitals in the U.S. trickled all through 2020, most of them towards the end of the year ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ), and some organizations ending up paying the hackers hundreds of thousands of U.S. dollars to return to normal activity.

Top 10 healthcare breaches in the U.S. exposed data of 19 million,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/top-10-healthcare-breaches-in-the-us-exposed-data-of-19-million/#comment_form,Ionut Ilascu,"December 31, 2021","The healthcare sector has been the target of hundreds of cyberattacks this year. A tally of public data breach reports so far shows that tens of millions of healthcare records have been exposed to unauthorized parties. Most of the largest data breaches result from ransomware attacks and the first ten of them account for more than half of all the healthcare records exposed in 2021. The breach notification rule under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), requires healthcare organizations to disclose a breach if it affects more than 500 residents of a state or jurisdiction. The top ten cyber events with the widest impact listed on the portal of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office for Civil Rights are from hacking incidents and account for exposing data of almost 19 million people. At the top of the list reported this year is an incident that impacted Florida Healthy Kids Corporation . Hackers exploiting vulnerabilities left unpatched for seven years in its website hosting platform had access to data of 3.5 million individuals. The second-largest data breach in the healthcare sector impacted the 20/20 Eye Care Network in Florida, which resulted in exposing the personal data of over 3.2 million individuals . Hackers gained access to the company’s AWS S3 buckets and deleted the information. A class-action suit was filed against 20/20 Eye Care Network. Another notable data breach comes from dermatology group practice Forefront Dermatology , which found that an unauthorized party had access to its systems for a week. The intrusion exposed information of more than 2.41 million patients, including names, addresses, dates of birth, health insurance plan member IDs, and medical and clinical treatment details. On February 19, 2021, NEC Networks (CaptureRx) discovered that its systems had been compromised two weeks earlier and the intruders had access to customer records. The investigation later determined that it was a ransomware attack that impacted data belonging to 1.65 million people. Data of over 1.5 million individuals was compromised in an attack on August 4 against Eskenazi Health public hospital division. The hackers had been on the internal network since May 19, preparing to encrypt the network, although they failed to complete the operation, the company said . While the threat actor did not encrypt any data, they managed to steal from the organization personal and health information belonging to patients. The Kroger Co. confirmed a data breach that exposed records of 1.47 million people. The incident was part of an extortion campaign from the Clop ransomware gang. Access to corporate data was possible by exploiting vulnerabilities in Accellion's legacy File Transfer Appliance service used by up to 100 companies. The Kroger supermarket chain, also a pharmacy operator, agreed to pay $5 million to end claims against it on behalf of customers and employees who had their personal information exposed. Also a victim of a ransomware attack, the St. Joseph’s/Candler health system announced that it detected the intrusion on June 17, 2021. An investigation revealed that the hackers had access to the network since December 18, 2020. While on the network the attackers had access to data of 1.4 million patients, including addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, driver’s license number, financial information, health insurance plan member ID, and medical and clinical treatment information. The REvil ransomware gang breached the systems of the University Medical Center Southern Nevada in mid-June that stored data of 1.3 million people. The data included personally identifiable information (PII) as well as “certain protected health information,” reveals the data security incident notification from the organization. American Anesthesiology notified patients in early January 2021 that Mednax Services, one of its service providers, had suffered a phishing incident that resulted in personal information being exposed to an unauthorized party The attacker had gained access to the partner’s Microsoft Office 365 email system in mid-June 2020 and could access personal information belonging to American Anesthesiology patients. In total, data of 1.2 million people were exposed. Last on the list of the largest ten data breaches reported so far in 2021 is Professional Business Systems, Inc., d/b/a Practicefirst Medical Management Solutions and PBS Medcode Corp., (“Practicefirst”) - a vendor for multiple healthcare providers. The incident was a failed ransomware attack and it became known in late December 2020. The hackers did not encrypt any data but they copied files from Practicefirst’s network , exposing the personal information of more than 1.2 million patients and employees. More than 50 hacking incidents disclosed on the HHS portal have affected upwards of 100,000 individuals, showing that organizations in the healthcare sector continue to be attractive targets. According to HIPAA Journal , close to 45 million healthcare records have been exposed or stolen in breaches reported in 2021.

According to an 8-K form filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Prudential detected the incident on February 5 , one day after the attackers (a suspected cybercrime group) breached its systems and accessed administrative/user data and employee/contractor accounts. In March, the Fortune 500 company revealed in a filing with the Maine Attorney General's Office that it notified over 36,000 people whose personal information (including names, driver's license numbers, and non-driver identification card numbers) was stolen during the breach. ""Through the investigation, we learned that the unauthorized third party gained access to our network on February 4, 2024 and removed a small percentage of personal information from our systems,"" Prudential said. ""As part of our response, we have worked with leading cybersecurity experts to confirm the unauthorized third party no longer has access to our company systems."" However, last week, the company updated the information shared with the Maine Attorney General's Office regarding the February data breach and now says that the incident impacted 2,556,210 people . A Prudential Financial spokesperson has yet to reply to BleepingComputer's request for more details regarding the attack. While Prudential has yet to share additional information regarding the threat actors behind the February 2024 data breach, the ALPHV/Blackcat ransomware gang claimed the attack on February 13. ALPHV shut down its operations and pulled an exit scam after stealing the $22 million ransom from Notchy, the affiliate behind the Change Healthcare breach. The FBI linked this ransomware gang to over 60 breaches worldwide during its first four months of activity and said that ALPHV raked in at least $300 million from over 1,000 victims until September 2023. Prudential is the second-largest life insurance company in the United States, with 40,000 employees worldwide and reported revenues of over $50 billion in 2023. In May 2023, the personal information of an additional 320,000 Prudential customers —including names, addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, and Social Security numbers—was also exposed after the Clop cybercrime gang hacked into the MOVEit Transfer file-sharing platform of Pension Benefit Information (PBI), a third-party vendor handling the data.

Beginning yesterday evening, DoorDash, which serves millions of customers across the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, started emailing those impacted by the newly discovered security incident. ""On October 25, 2025, our team identified a cybersecurity incident that involved an unauthorized third party gaining access to and taking certain user contact information, which varied by individual,"" states the email notification from DoorDash. The information may have included: ""Our investigation has since confirmed that your personal information was affected."" The incident has been traced to a DoorDash employee falling victim to a social engineering scam. Upon becoming aware, the company's incident response team shut down the unauthorized party's access, started an investigation, and referred the matter to law enforcement. The disclosure does not specify how many users were affected, though the company says the incident impacted a mix of consumers, Dashers, and merchants. This marks the third notable security incident suffered by the delivery giant. In 2019, a data breach at DoorDash had exposed the information of roughly 5 million customers , Dashers and merchants to an unauthorized party. In August 2022, the company encountered another data breach from threat actors who had also attacked Twilio that year. What's interesting is that a French translation of the notice is appended to these emails: At this time, it appears that the emails primarily went to DoorDash Canada users (including myself). However, an undated security advisory posted on DoorDash's website suggests the incident may extend beyond Canada. It has references to U.S.-specific data types, like Social Security Numbers (SSNs), which DoorDash says were not accessed (Canadian counterpart would be Social Insurance Numbers (SINs) ). BleepingComputer has approached the DoorDash press team to clarify whether the breach also affects users in the U.S. or other regions where the company operates. Some users on social media have rebuked DoorDash, questioning the company's handling of the incident and the timing of the notifications. ""I'm sorry - if this isn't sensitive information, what is? Don't downplay this just because they didn't get credit card or password information. It's gone deaf,"" posted Chris from Toronto. Cybersecurity professional Kostas T. also reacted to the email's phrasing, expressing that the statement ""no sensitive information was accessed"" conflicted with the personal information that the company acknowledged was accessed. ""DoorDash took 19 whole days to notify me of a data breach that has leaked my personal information. Thankfully I used a fake name and forwarded email address for my account, but my real phone number and physical address have been leaked,"" wrote X user Ohqay. ""This is incredibly unprofessional, dangerous, and potentially illegal behaviour from DoorDash... This process violates Canadian data breach law. I'll be filing a case against DoorDash in provincial small claims court and making a complaint to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada."" Users should be wary of unsolicited communications or targeted phishing emails appearing to originate from DoorDash. DoorDash warns that you should avoid clicking on links or attachments within suspicious emails, and to refrain from providing any personal information to unfamiliar websites. ""We have already taken steps to respond to the incident, including deploying enhancements to our security systems, implementing additional training for our employees, bringing in a leading cybersecurity forensic firm to assist in our investigation of this issue, and notifying law enforcement for ongoing investigation,"" states the company. DoorDash users with questions related to the incident can further call the toll-free number +1-833-918-8030 and cite reference code: B155060.

The type of information exposed in the data breach includes the following: The data could help an attacker target MBS customers in various scams as well as phishing and social engineering attacks. It is specifically clarified that current evidence does not indicate that casino members (Sands Rewards Club) have been impacted by the incident. The company says that MBS customers who have had their personal data exposed to the attackers will be informed of the breach and impact in indivifual notifications. After discovering the incident, MBS reported it to authorities in Singapore and other relevant countries. While the scope of the attack has not been clarified publicly, the intrusion could be related to a ransomawre attack. Threat actors are often stealing data from company networks and then try to extort money from the victim.

Ascension discloses new data breach after third-party hacking incident,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ascension-discloses-new-data-breach-after-third-party-hacking-incident/#comment_form,Sergiu Gatlan,"April 30, 2025","​Ascension, one of the largest private healthcare systems in the United States, is notifying patients that their personal and health information was stolen in a December 2024 data theft attack, which affected a former business partner. The health network operates 142 hospitals nationwide, has over 142,000 employees, and has reported a total revenue of $28.3 billion in 2023. ""On December 5, 2024, we learned that Ascension patient information may have been involved in a potential security incident. We immediately initiated an investigation to determine whether and how a security incident occurred,"" Ascension says in data breach notifications sent to affected individuals. ""Our investigation determined on January 21, 2025, that Ascension inadvertently disclosed information to a former business partner, and some of this information was likely stolen from them due to a vulnerability in third-party software used by the former business partner."" Depending on the impacted patient, the attackers gained access to a combination of personal information, including name, address, phone number(s), email address, date of birth, race, gender, and Social Security numbers (SSNs). They could also access personal health information related to inpatient visits, including the physician's name, admission and discharge dates, diagnosis and billing codes, medical record number, and insurance company name. Even though the breach notifications didn't include any information regarding the total number of patients who had their data exposed in this breach, the healthcare system said in an April 29 filing that the incident impacted 114,692 individuals in Texas alone. The company also told Massachusetts' Office of the Attorney General that 96 MA residents were also affected and had their medical records and SSNs exposed in the incident. Ascension now offers two years of free identity monitoring services, including credit monitoring, fraud consultation, and identity theft restoration to those affected by this data breach. While the company didn't share any additional details regarding the breach impacting its former business partner, the timeline of the breach implies the attack was part of a series of Clop ransomware data theft attacks that exploited a zero-day flaw in Cleo secure file transfer software. An Ascension spokesperson was not immediately available for comment when contacted by BleepingComputer earlier today.

American Express Customer Info Accessed by Employee for Possible Fraud,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/american-express-customer-info-accessed-by-employee-for-possible-fraud/,Lawrence Abrams,"October 2, 2019","An American Express employee is being investigated for accessing card holder information and potentially using it to open accounts at other financial institutions. Starting on September 30th, 2019, American Express began sending out data breach notifications to cardholder members whose information was fraudulently accessed by an employee. According to this notification, an employee was accessing the information for cardholders and potentially using it to perform identity theft by fraudulently opening accounts at other financial institutions. ""It was brought to our attention that personal information, related to your American Express Card account listed above, may have been wrongfully accessed by one of our employees in an attempt to conduct fraudulent activity, including potentially opening accounts at other financial institutions. In response, we immediately launched an investigation and are fully cooperating with law enforcement agencies to further their investigation."" The information that was accessed for affected members includes the full name, physical and/or billing address, Social Security numbers, birth dates, and the credit card number. While the notifications are titled ""Notice of Data Breach"", this is not the same type of data breach that we commonly report on. No systems were hacked or databases stolen. Instead this was an employee of American Express accessing information when they were not supposed to in order to use it for fraudulent purposes. In a statement to BleepingComputer, AMEX has stated that the person is no longer employed by them and is currently under criminal investigation. ""We are aware of this issue. Ensuring the security of our customers’ information is our top priority, and we are investigating this matter in close partnership with law enforcement,"" American Express told BleepingComptuer via email. ""We can tell you the person in question is no longer an employee of American Express. Given this is an active criminal investigation, we can’t provide any further comment."" For those who are affected, American Express is offering free credit monitoring through Experian Identity Works. To enroll, the AMEX data breach notification will contain an activation code and order number that needs to be used when registering the service. It is also strongly advised that victims monitor their credit report and statements for any fraudulent activity and immediately report it to their financial institution.

Flipboard Databases Hacked and User Information Exposed,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/flipboard-databases-hacked-and-user-information-exposed/#comment_form,Lawrence Abrams,"May 28, 2019","The news aggregation site, Flipboard, has disclosed that their databases had been hacked and unauthorized users have potentially downloaded the data contained within them. This data included the personal account information and digital tokens for some of their over 100 million users. According to emails seen by BleepingComputer and a security incident notice published on their site, Flipboard stated that hackers gained access to some of their databases during two different time periods.The first time was between June 2nd, 2018 and March 23, 2019 and the second was between April 21st and 22nd, 2019. It is not known if these were the same users accessing the databases at different periods or two separate data breaches. ""We recently identified unauthorized access to some of our databases containing certain Flipboard users’ account information, including account credentials,"" stated Flipboard's security incident notice . ""In response to this discovery, we immediately launched an investigation and an external security firm was engaged to assist. Findings from the investigation indicate an unauthorized person accessed and potentially obtained copies of certain databases containing Flipboard user information between June 2, 2018 and March 23, 2019 and April 21 – 22, 2019."" On April 23rd, 2019, while investigating suspicious activity on their databases in March 2019, they discovered that there was further unauthorized activity on April 21-22nd, 2019. This allowed the hackers to view and potentially download user information such as user names, hashed and salted passwords, and for some users, their email addresses and digital tokens used to login to Flipboard using site credentials from Google, Facebook, and Twitter. Flipboard states that the vast majority of the exposed user passwords were hashed with a strong cipher called bcrypt. This would make it difficult, but not impossible, to crack the passwords. Users who have not logged into their accounts since March 14th, 2012, though, would have had their passwords hashed using SHA-1, which would be easier to crack. Of particular concern are digital tokens for sites used to login to Flipboard that were stored in the database. If the hacker gained access to these tokens, they could used them to gain access in some manner to these other sites. To be safe, Flipboard replaced or deleted all digital tokens stored in these databases. ""Flipboard replaced or deleted all digital tokens. Those tokens are no longer valid and therefore cannot be misused. Prior to the digital tokens being replaced or deleted, the access that the unauthorized person may have had to the third-party accounts linked to Flipboard accounts varies by the type of linked account as well as the permissions the user gave when linking it to the user’s Flipboard account, but potentially may have allowed the unauthorized person to read or make posts and messages on the account and access some user account information, such as user name, profile information, posts to the site, and connections. In some cases, this access also allowed changes to this information, such as inviting new people to connect. We have not found any evidence the unauthorized person accessed third-party account(s) connected to your Flipboard accounts."" Flipboard has stated that they are still investigating the breach and do not know at this time how many users were affected. Due to this, they have decided to reset all of their user's passwords and emailed a security notice describing the incident. ""We’re still in the process of determining the total number. We do know that not all accounts were compromised.""

Malaysia Airlines discloses a breach spanning 9 years of data,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/malaysia-airlines-discloses-a-breach-spanning-9-years-of-data/,Lawrence Abrams,"March 2, 2021","​Malaysia Airlines has suffered a data breach spanning nine yearsof data that exposed the personal information of members in its Enrich frequent flyer program. Starting yesterday, Malaysia Airlines began emailing members of their Enrich rewards program to disclose that they were affected by a data breach. According to Malaysia Airlines, the breach occurred at a third-party IT service provider who notified the airline that member data was exposed between March 2010 and June 2019. ""Malaysia Airlines was notified of a data security incident at one of its third-party IT service providers which involved some personal data of members of Enrich, Malaysia Airlines' Frequent Flyer Programme between the period of March 2010 and June 2019. The incident did not affect Malaysia Airlines' own IT infrastructure and systems in any way."" The member information exposed during the data breach includes member names, contact information, date of birth, gender, frequent flyer number, status. and rewards tier level. The exposed data did not include Enrich member's itineraries, reservations, ticketing, or any ID card or payment card information. While Malaysia Airlines says that no passwords were exposed and there is no evidence of misuse, the airline recommends that users change their passwords anyway. It is unknown how many Enrich members were affected by this breach. BleepingComputer has contacted Malaysia Airlines with further questions but has not heard back. If you are a member of the Enrich program, you should immediately login to your account and change your password. If this password is utilized at other sites, it should be changed there as well. Malaysia Airlines further warned that it would not be contacting members about updating their information over the phone. Therefore, if you receive a phone call from Malaysia Airlines about this breach or asking for further information, you should be immediately suspicious and hang up the call. It is common for threat actors to use data found in data breaches to perform malicious attacks, and all Enrich members should be wary of emails, texts, and calls from the airline.

After becoming aware of the incident on July 24th, the networking equipment giant discovered that the attacker tricked an employee and gained access to a third-party cloud-based Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system used by Cisco. This allowed the threat actor to steal the personal and user information of individuals with Cisco.com user accounts, including names, organization names, addresses, Cisco-assigned user IDs, email addresses, phone numbers, and account metadata such as creation dates. However, the company said that the attacker didn't obtain ""organizational customers' confidential or proprietary information, or any passwords or other types of sensitive information."" Cisco added that the incident didn't impact its products or services, and no other Cisco CRM system instances were affected. ""Upon learning of the incident, the actor's access to that CRM system instance was immediately terminated and Cisco commenced an investigation. Cisco has engaged with data protection authorities and notified affected users where required by law,"" the company said . ""We are implementing further security measures to mitigate the risk of similar incidents occurring in the future, including re-educating personnel on how to identify and protect against potential vishing attacks."" Cisco has yet to disclose how many individuals had their personal and user account information stolen in the incident, and whether the attackers requested a ransom in exchange for not leaking the stolen data online. Although not yet confirmed by the company, this is likely part of an ongoing wave of Salesforce data theft attacks using vishing and social engineering techniques that have been linked to the ShinyHunters extortion group . Other high-profile companies have been impacted by Salesforce data breaches in recent weeks, including Adidas , Qantas , Allianz Life , LVMH brands Louis Vuitton , Dior , and Tiffany & Co. , as well as fashion giant Chanel . When contacted by BleepingComputer, a Cisco spokesperson referred us to the public statement and did not confirm whether the data was stolen from a compromised Salesforce instance, nor did they disclose the number of individuals affected. In October, Cisco also had to take its public DevHub portal offline after a threat actor known as IntelBroker leaked ""non-public"" data on the BreachForums hacking forum.

7 million Robinhood user email addresses for sale on hacker forum,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/7-million-robinhood-user-email-addresses-for-sale-on-hacker-forum/#comment_form,Lawrence Abrams,"November 15, 2021","The data for approximately 7 million Robinhood customers stolen in a recent data breach are being sold on a popular hacking forum and marketplace. Last week, Robinhood disclosed a data breach after one of its employees was hacked, and the threat actor used their account to access the information for approximately 7 million users through customer support systems. The data stolen during the attack includes the following personal information for Robinhood users: In addition to stealing the data, Robinhood stated that the hacker attempted to extort the company to prevent the data from being released. Stolen email addresses, especially those for financial services, are particularly popular among threat actors as they can be used in targeted phishing attacks to steal more sensitive data. Two days after Robinhood disclosed the attack, a threat actor named 'pompompurin' announced that they were selling the data on a hacking forum. In a forum post, pompompurin said he was selling 7 million Robinhood customers' stolen information for at least five figures, which is $10,000 or higher. The sold data includes 5 million email addresses, and for another batch of Robinhood customers, 2 million email addresses and their full names. However, pompompurin said they were not selling the data for 310 customers who had more sensitive information stolen, including identification cards for some users. Robinhood did not initially disclose the theft of ID cards, and the threat actor states that they downloaded them from SendSafely, a secure file transfer service used by the trading platform when performing Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements. ""As we disclosed on November 8, we experienced a data security incident and a subset of approximately 10 customers had more extensive personal information and account details revealed,"" Robinhood told BleepingComputer after we contacted them regarding the sale of their data. ""These more extensive account details included identification images for some of those 10 people. Like other financial services companies, we collect and retain identification images for some customers as part of our regulatory-required Know Your Customer checks."" pompompurin told BleepingComputer that he gained access to the Robinhood customer support systems after tricking a help desk employee into installing a remote access software on their computer. Once remote access software is installed on a device, a threat actor can monitor their activities, take screenshots, and remotely access the computer. Additionally, while remotely controlling a device, the attackers can also use the employee's saved login credentials to log in to internal Robinhood systems that they had access to. ""I was able to see all account information on people. I saw a few people while the support agent did work,"" pompompurin told BleepingComputer. In response to further questions regarding how the employee's device was breached, Robinhood referred us back to their original statement stating that the threat actor ""socially engineered a customer support employee by phone."" However, they did confirm to BleepingComputer that malware was not used in the attack As proof that they conducted the attack, pompompurin posted screenshots seen by BleepingComputer of the attackers accessing internal Robinhood systems. These screenshots included an internal help desk system used to lookup Robinhood member information by email address, an internal knowledge base page about a ""Project Oliver Twister"" initiative designed to protect high-risk customers, and an ""annotations"" page showing notes for a particular customer. After learning of the data being sold, BleepingComputer contacted Robinhood and asked for confirmation as to whether these screenshots originated from their systems. While they did not explicitly confirm the screenshots are of their systems, they asked that any screenshots be redacted of private information, indicating they were likely taken during the attack. This threat actor, pompompurin, was also responsible for abusing FBI's email servers to send threatening emails over the weekend, This weekend, US entities began to receive emails sent from FBI infrastructure warning recipients that their ""virtualized clusters "" were being targeted in a ""sophisticated chain attack,"" as shown in the email below. To send these emails, pompompurin found a bug in the FBI Law Enforcement Enterprise Portal (LEEP) portal that the actor could exploit to send emails from IP addresses belonging to the FBI. As the emails came from IP addresses owned by the FBI, it added legitimacy to the emails, causing the government agency to become flooded with concerned calls about the fake warnings.

Truepill is a B2B-focused pharmacy platform that uses APIs for order fulfillment and delivery services for direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands, digital health companies, and other healthcare organizations across all 50 states in the U.S. Regarding the number of impacted individuals, According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights breach portal the incident incident impacts 2,364,359 people . The letter informs that the company discovered unauthorized network access on August 31, 2023. The investigation of the incident revealed that the attackers had gained access a day before. The data types that might have been accessed by the threat actors include: The above information increases the risks of phishing and social engineering attacks. The notice clarifies that Social Security numbers (SSNs) were not in the exposed data set. Some of the people receiving the data breach notices were somewhat puzzled , claiming they had never heard of the company and were unsure how their data got to Truepill. The far-reaching impact of the incident may lead to legal consequences as multiple class action lawsuits are being prepared across the country, arguing that the breach would have been prevented if Postmeds maintained a better security stance compatible with the industry guidelines. Specifically, Postmeds is blamed for not encrypting sensitive healthcare information stored on its servers, which would significantly lessen the impact of a data breach. The delay in notifying consumers may also be part of the possible lawsuits, as the firm took more than two months to inform affected persons. During that time, some of the impacted people observed suspicious activity on their Venmo accounts, and confirmed later that their personal data had been posted on the dark web. The content of the notices is also criticized for being too vague, not providing details about how the intruders gained access to the firm’s systems, and lacking any protection guidance for the recipients and identity theft protection service coverage. One of the law firms leading a litigation motion against Postmed reports that the leaked data also includes addresses, dates of birth, medical treatment information, diagnosis information, and health insurance information, which aren’t mentioned in the firm’s notice.

MoneyLion locks customer accounts after credential stuffing attacks,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/moneylion-locks-customer-accounts-after-credential-stuffing-attacks/,Sergiu Gatlan,"October 1, 2021","The banking and investing platform MoneyLion had to lock customer accounts that were breached in credential stuffing attacks over the summer, in June and July. The fintech company has provided mobile banking services for borrowing, saving, and investing money to more than 8.5 million Americans since its launch in 2013. In credential stuffing attacks, threat actors use large collections of username/password combinations leaked following security breaches of various online services to log into the victims' user accounts on other online platforms. Such attacks commonly work particularly well against those who reuse their credentials for accounts on multiple sites. The attackers' end goal is to gain access to as many accounts as possible to steal sensitive info and money or to take over the identities of the accounts' owners. ""MoneyLion promptly started an investigation and determined that a very limited number of accounts were potentially impacted. Similar activity occurred again between July 13 – 16, and once again between July 27 – 30,"" the company said in a data breach notice . ""Through our investigation, we have determined that an unauthorized outside party appears to have been attempting to gain access to your account on the application using an account password and/or possibly email address that appear to have been potentially compromised in a prior event on another site unrelated to MoneyLion."" The attackers could only gain access to customers' accounts but didn't breach MoneyLion's systems. The digital financial platform found no evidence that the credentials used in the attacks were obtained from MoneyLion's servers. MoneyLion also failed to find proof that the affected customers' Social Security Number, driver license numbers, and payment information relating to linked bank accounts or debit cards were impacted in the incidents. However, the company admitted that ""it does appear that an unauthorized outside party"" used their passwords to access their accounts. In response to the attacks, MoneyLion locked the impacted customers' accounts to force them to reset their credentials and notified them of the incident. ""Additionally, as you may be aware, we also have implemented additional multi-factor authentication for all accounts,"" MoneyLion added. ""As always, we recommend that you remain vigilant to fraud and that you always use unique passwords for all websites and applications – and update those passwords often, storing them in a secure location."" MoneyLion announced plans to become publicly traded after the completion of a business combination with Fusion Acquisition Corp, a transaction approved at a Fusion stockholders' meeting on September 21.

Both airlines were informed of the Pilot Credentials incident on May 3, which was limited solely to the systems of the third-party vendor, with no compromise or impact on the airlines' own networks or systems. An unauthorized individual gained access to Pilot Credentials' systems on April 30 and stole documents containing information provided by certain applicants in the pilot and cadet hiring process. According to breach notifications filed on Friday with Maine's Office of the Attorney General, American Airlines said the data breach affected 5745 pilots and applicants , while Southwest reported a total of 3009 . ""Our investigation determined that the data involved contained some of your personal information, such as your name and Social Security number, driver’s license number, passport number, date of birth, Airman Certificate number, and other government-issued identification number(s),"" American Airlines revealed. Although no evidence indicating that the pilots' personal information was specifically targeted or exploited for fraudulent or identity theft purposes was found, the airlines will, from now on, direct all pilot and cadet applicants to self-managed internal portals. ""We are no longer utilizing the vendor, and, moving forward, Pilot applicants are being directed to an internal portal managed by Southwest,"" Southwest Airlines said. American Airlines and Southwest Airlines have also notified relevant law enforcement authorities of the breaches and are fully cooperating with their ongoing investigation into the matter. The disclosures come after American Airlines disclosed another data breach in September 2022 that impacted over 1,708 American Airlines customers and team members following a July 2022 phishing attack that led to the compromise of a number of employee email accounts. As disclosed at the time, personal information exposed in the July 2022 breach may have included employees' and customers' names, dates of birth, mailing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, driver's license numbers, passport numbers, and/or certain medical information. A subsequent investigation also indicated that the attackers used the employees' compromised accounts to send more phishing emails. American Airlines was also hit by a data breach in March 2021 after global air information tech giant SITA disclosed that hackers breached its servers and accessed the Passenger Service System (PSS) used by multiple airlines worldwide. American Airlines is the world's largest airline by fleet size (with over 1,300 aircraft in its mainline), operates almost 6,700 flights daily to roughly 350 destinations in over 50 countries, and has more than 120,000 employees.

Three U.S. Universities Disclose Data Breaches Over Two-Day Span,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/three-us-universities-disclose-data-breaches-over-two-day-span/,Sergiu Gatlan,"June 15, 2019","Three U.S. universities have disclosed data breach incidents impacting personally identifiable information of students or employees following unauthorized access to some of their employees' email accounts. All three universities — Graceland University, Oregon State University, and Missouri Southern State University — have notified the individuals whose personal information was potentially stolen or accessed about the security incidents. In addition, no evidence has been found of the impacted personal information being stolen or used in a malicious manner while investigating the disclosed data privacy incidents involving all three universities. Graceland University says in a notice of data breach published on June 14 that an ""unauthorized user gained access to the email accounts of current employees,"" on March 29, 2019, as well as ""from April 1-30 and April 12-May 1, 2019, respectively."" As the university discovered during the breach investigation, ""the personal information of some people who had interacted with these email accounts over the past several years was available during the time the unauthorized user(s) had access."" The information that could have been accessed during the incident contained: • full name • social security number • date of birth • address • telephone number • email address • parents/children • salary information • financial aid information for enrollment or possible enrollment at Graceland Oregon State University (OSU) states in a press release that ""636 student records and family records of students containing personally identifiable information were potentially affected by a data privacy incident that occurred in early May."" OSU says that a joint investigation carried out with the help of forensics specialists found that an employee's hacked email account containing documents with the info of the 636 students and their family members was also used by the attackers to ""send phishing e-mails across the nation."" As detailed by Steve Clark, OSU's VP for university relations and marketing: OSU is continuing to investigate this matter and determine whether the cyber attacker viewed or copied these documents with personal information. According to Clark, the university is also reviewing the protection systems and procedures used to shield OSU's e-mail accounts and information systems. Missouri Southern State University (MSSU) , the third entity which reported a breach, states in a notice of data breach sent to the Office of the Vermont Attorney General that it was alerted of a possible cyber attack triggered by a phishing email on January 9. The phishing attack made several victims among the university's employees which prompted a law enforcement notification. The university officials were told afterward to delay notification of affected individuals until investigations are complete. MSSU also hired a leading forensic investigation firm to look into the security incident and to ""block potential email exploitation, including a mass password reset of all employee Office 365 accounts."" After analyzing the contents of the impacted Office 365 accounts, MSSU found that the emails contained within stored ""first and last names, dates of birth, home addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers, and social security numbers."" As further explained in the data breach notification send to the Vermont Attorney General by MSSU: In late March, April, and early May, the University identified emails containing personal information that may have been compromised by the attack. In mid-May, the University confirmed that your first and last name and social security number were contained in the impacted accounts. BleepingComputer has reached out to Graceland University, Oregon State University, and Missouri Southern State University for additional comments, but had not heard back at the time of this publication. Update June 17: Mike Olmstead, Missouri Southern State University's Director of News Services & Messaging, sent an official statement from the university: Missouri Southern State University was the victim of a cybersecurity attack on January 9, 2019. The University responded quickly and engaged a leading forensic investigation firm to help stop the attack and provide subsequent investigation services. The University notified the Federal Bureau of Investigation Cyber Crime Task Force and the Missouri Attorney General’s Office about the incident. The University worked diligently to notify all impacted individuals once the results of its investigation had been communicated to law enforcement. The notification letters were mailed to all impacted individuals on June 13, 2019, and the University has offered all impacted individuals 24 months complimentary credit monitoring.

21 Million Logins for Top 500 Firms Offered on the Dark Web,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/21-million-logins-for-top-500-firms-offered-on-the-dark-web/,Ionut Ilascu,"October 30, 2019","A little over 21 million login credentials stolen from Fortune 500 companies have been found in various places on the dark web, many of them already cracked and available in plaintext form. The information was compiled by crawling multiple resources, like markets in the Tor network, web forums, Pastebin, IRC channels, social networks, and messenger chats. 21,040,296 is the exact number of credentials belonging to companies ranking in the first 500 that security researchers found on the web. Most of them were from tech companies, closely followed by organizations in the financial industry. Entities in the healthcare, energy, telecommunications, retail, industrial, transport, aerospace and defense sectors are also on the list. Not all of them are fresh, though. ImmuniWeb says in a report published today that 16,055,871 of the credentials they found were compromised in the past 12 months. However, the researchers reveal a worrying statistic: ""95% of the credentials contained unencrypted, or brute-forced and cracked by the attackers, plaintext passwords."" Using machine learning technology, the researchers were able to determine the accuracy and reliability of the data set by cleaning it of fake leaks, duplicates and default passwords set automatically. Despite finding as many as 21 million login records, the report notes that only 4.9 million of them were unique, ""suggesting that many users are using identical or similar passwords."" Of course the most insecure password and variations of it are present in the data set; and they were found in data sets for companies in almost all verticals, except the financial one, where users relied on other, equally weak logins. Although it was not the most popular in all cases, ""password"" and its variants exist in the top five most used passwords. A simple glance at the passwords below makes it clear that companies still haven't learned how to protect access to their assets and that recommendation for using a strong password flew right past them. Even an uncomplicated phrase that does not use special symbols, numbers or upper case letters is better than any of them. According to the report, the weakest logins were from the retail industry, where almost half of the passwords were less than eight characters long and could be found in common dictionaries. However, companies in other industries are not far behind in this. Most industries in the top ten with the weakest passwords from ImmuniWeb's report have a third or more logins that could be cracked in seconds. The researchers note that about 11% of the passwords from a data breach are identical. This could be explained by the use of default passwords, bots creating accounts. A reset procedure that defined the same password for a large number of accounts is another possibility, ImmuniWeb says. Additionally, there may be a connection between the number of subdomains with a poor web security grade (C or F) and the exposed credentials as they are proportional. Ilia Kolochenko, CEO and Founder of ImmuniWeb says that cybercriminals focus on the shortest, least resistant path to get what they want. Given the login data in the report, they have no trouble getting their prize.

Shopping platform PandaBuy data leak impacts 1.3 million users,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/shopping-platform-pandabuy-data-leak-impacts-13-million-users/#comment_form,Bill Toulas,"April 1, 2024","Data belonging to more than 1.3 million customers of the PandaBuy online shopping platform has been leaked, allegedly after two threat actors exploited multiple vulnerabilities to breach systems. PandaBuy allows international users to purchase products from various e-commerce platforms in China, including Tmall, Taobao, and JD.com. Yesterday, a threat actor named 'Sanggiero' claimed a breach on PandaBuy, allegedly performed together with another threat actor called 'IntelBoker.' ""The data was stolen by exploiting several critical vulnerabilities in the platform's API and other bugs were identified allowing access to the internal service of the website,"" the threat actor said. ""The data contained 3M+ unique UserId, First Name, Last Name, Phone Numbers, Emails, Login IP, Orders_Data, Orders_Id, Home_address, Zip, Country, and so on."" According to data breach aggregation service Have I Been Pwned (HIBP), 1,348,407 PandaBuy accounts have been exposed in the breach. The details of PandaBuy shoppers were leaked on a forum and can be obtained by any registered members in exchange for a symbolic payment in cryptocurrency. To prove to unregistered members that the information is valid, the threat actor provides a small sample containing email addresses, customer names, order numbers and details, shipping addresses, transaction dates and times, and payment IDs. Troy Hunt, the creator of HIBP, tested password reset requests using the leaked addresses and confirmed that at least 1.3 million email addresses are valid and come from PandaBuy. The rest are made-up and duplicate addresses, so the ""3 million"" figure was inflated by the threat actors. PandaBuy has not made any statements about the data breach. According to some reports , the company is trying to conceal the incident by censoring user posts on Discord and Reddit . A company representative with an administrator role on the Discord channel said that a security incident had occurred in the past and that the leaked data was old and that the platform's security team had responded to the issue promptly. If you have an account on PandaBuy, it is strongly recommended to reset your password. Also, remain vigilant for scam attempts and treat unsolicited communications with suspicion. PandaBuy user data has been added to HIBP and subscribers to the service should have received an email informing them of the leak.

Reddit hackers threaten to leak data stolen in February breach,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/reddit-hackers-threaten-to-leak-data-stolen-in-february-breach/,Lawrence Abrams,"June 18, 2023","The BlackCat (ALPHV) ransomware gang is behind a February cyberattack on Reddit, where the threat actors claim to have stolen 80GB of data from the company. On February 9th, Reddit disclosed that its systems were hacked on February 5th after an employee fell victim to a phishing attack. This phishing attack allowed the threat actors to gain access to Reddit's systems and steal internal documents, source code, employee data, and limited data about the company's advertisers. ""After successfully obtaining a single employee's credentials, the attacker gained access to some internal docs, code, as well as some internal dashboards and business systems,"" explained a post by Reddit CTO Christopher Slowe, aka KeyserSosa. ""We show no indications of breach of our primary production systems (the parts of our stack that run Reddit and store the majority of our data)."" However, Reddit said that production systems were not breached, and no user passwords, accounts, or credit card information were impacted. While Reddit did not share many details on the phishing attack, they said it was similar to a phishing attack on Riot Games that allowed hackers to gain access to systems and steal source code for League of Legends (LoL), Teamfight Tactics (TFT), and the company's Packman legacy anti-cheat platform. During the attack on Riot, the threat actors demanded $10 million not to leak the stolen data . However, when a ransom was not paid, the threat actors attempted to sell the data for $1 million on a hacking forum . As first spotted by Dominic Alvieri and shared with BleepingComputer, the ALPHV ransomware operation, more commonly known as BlackCat, now claims to be behind the February 5th cyberattack on Reddit. In a ""Reddit Files"" post on the gang's data leak site, the threat actors claim to have stolen 80 GB of compressed data from the company during the attack and now plan on leaking the data. The threat actors say they attempted to contact Reddit twice, on April 13th and June 16th, demanding $4.5 million for the data to be deleted but did not receive a response. ""I told them in my first email that I would wait for their IPO to come along. But this seems like the perfect opportunity! We are very confident that Reddit will not pay any money for their data,"" threatened the ransomware operation. ""But I am very happy to know that the public will be able to read about all the statistics they track about their users and all the interesting confidential data we took. Did you know they also silently censor users? Along with artifacts from their GitHub!"" After not receiving a response, the threat actors now threaten to leak Reddit’s data if the company doesn’t pay the ransom and backtrack on their plans on charging for API access. While Reddit declined to comment about BlackCat's post, BleepingComputer has been able to confirm that this is the same attack disclosed by Reddit in February. It should be noted that while BlackCat is a ransomware gang, they did not encrypt devices in this attack. The same hacking group is believed to be linked to a similar attack on Western Digital in March 2023, causing a massive outage to the company's My Cloud cloud service. While the threat actors behind the Western Digital attack initially claimed not to have a name, screenshots of the stolen data were leaked on the ALPHV data leak site, with the threat actors taunting the company about the attack . Western Digital sent data breach notifications in May, warning online store customers that their data was stolen during the attack. It's budget season!

Google Estimates 1.5% of Web Logins Exposed in Data Breaches,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-estimates-15-percent-of-web-logins-exposed-in-data-breaches/,Lawrence Abrams,"August 15, 2019","A study released by Google estimates that 1.5% of all logins used across the web are vulnerable to credential stuffing attacks due to being disclosed in data breaches. This number is based off of anonymous login data provided to Google through their Password Checkup extension. To conduct this study, Google created a breach notification service and an associated Chrome Password Checkup browser extension that collects anonymous data and hashed logins. When a user logs into a site with the extension installed, the anonymous hash of the login credentials is sent back to Google and checked against 4 billion usernames and passwords that were leaked in data breaches. If a match was found, a notification like the one below would be shown that warns the user and prompts them to change their password. Using anonymous statistics collected during a period of one month between February 5–March 4, 2019, Google found that 1.5% of the 21,177,237 monitored logins were found in data breaches. This came out to 316,531 logins for the approximately 670,000 users who installed the Password Checkup extension. Of those users who were notified, only 26% of the warnings resulted in a password change. Of these password changes, though, 60% resulted in the user changing to a more secure password than their original one. ""Nearly 670,000 users from around the world installed our extension over a period of February 5–March 4, 2019. During this measurement window, we detected that 1.5% of over 21 million logins were vulnerable due to relying on a breached credential—or one warning for every two users. By alerting users to this breach status, 26% of our warnings resulted in users migrating to a new password. Of these new passwords, 94% were at least as strong as the original."" The category of sites that created the largest amount of warnings were adult sites and entertainment sites, like video streaming sites. Adult sites had a warning rate of 3.6%, while entertainment sites had a rate of 6.3%. As compromised login credentials could be used in credential stuffing attacks, which is when attackers try to access other sites using leaked logins, it is important to use unique passwords for each site and to quickly change passwords that are exposed. While Google estimates that only 1.5% of all logins have been compromised in data breaches, it is very possible that this number is higher. Most users who use the web to shop, bank, or perform other logins are probably not as security conscious as those who installed Google's Password Checkup extension. ""Our detection rate is lower than the 6.9% reported by Thomas et al. [54] for 751 million Google accounts and 1.9 billion breached credentials. Possible reasons include the user population that adopted our extension is more security conscious— thus avoiding reuse as a behavior—or that dormant accounts have a higher reuse rate, which by nature our extension cannot observe as we perform checks at login time"" Therefore if you take into consideration the general population of users on the web, rather than those who take an active approach to security, the percent of compromised logins could be considerably higher. The full results from Google's study can be found in the "" Protecting accounts from credential stuffing with password breach alerting "" paper whose results will be presented this week at the USENIX Security Symposium .

PayPal accounts breached in large-scale credential stuffing attack,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/paypal-accounts-breached-in-large-scale-credential-stuffing-attack/,Bill Toulas,"January 19, 2023","PayPal is sending out data breach notifications to thousands of users who had their accounts accessed through credential stuffing attacks that exposed some personal data. Credential stuffing are attacks where hackers attempt to access an account by trying out username and password pairs sourced from data leaks on various websites. This type of attack relies on an automated approach with bots running lists of credentials to ""stuff"" into login portals for various services. Credential stuffing targets users that employ the same password for multiple online accounts, which is known as ""password recycling."" PayPal explains that the credential stuffing attack occurred between December 6 and December 8, 2022. The company detected and mitigated it at the time but also started an internal investigation to find out how the hackers obtained access to the accounts. By December 20, 2022, PayPal concluded its investigation, confirming that unauthorized third parties logged into the accounts with valid credentials. The electronic payments platform claims that this was not due to a breach on its systems and has no evidence that the user credentials were obtained directly from them. According to the data breach reporting from PayPal, 34,942 of its users have been impacted by the incident. During the two days, hackers had access to account holders' full names, dates of birth, postal addresses, social security numbers, and individual tax identification numbers. Transaction histories, connected credit or debit card details, and PayPal invoicing data are also accessible on PayPal accounts. PayPal says it took timely action to limit the intruders' access to the platform and reset the passwords of accounts confirmed to have been breached. Also, the notification claims that the attackers have not attempted or did not manage to perform any transactions from the breached PayPal accounts. ""We have no information suggesting that any of your personal information was misused as a result of this incident, or that there are any unauthorized transactions on your account,"" reads PayPal's notification to impacted users. ""We reset the passwords of the affected PayPal accounts and implemented enhanced security controls that will require you to establish a new password the next time you log in to your account"" - PayPal Impacted users will receive a free-of-charge two-year identity monitoring service from Equifax. The company strongly recommends that recipients of the notices change the passwords for other online accounts using a unique and long string. Typically, a good password is at least 12-characters long and includes alphanumeric characters and symbols. Moreover, PayPal advises users to activate two-factor authentication (2FA) protection from the 'Account Settings' menu, which can prevent an unauthorized party from accessing an account, even if they have a valid username and password.

DraftKings warns data of 67K people was exposed in account hacks,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/draftkings-warns-data-of-67k-people-was-exposed-in-account-hacks/,Sergiu Gatlan,"December 19, 2022","Sports betting company DraftKings revealed last week that more than 67,000 customers had their personal information exposed following a credential attack in November . In credential stuffing attacks, automated tools are used to make a massive number of attempts (up to millions at a time) to sign into accounts using credentials (user/password pairs) stolen from other online services. This tactic works exceptionally well against user accounts whose owners have reused the same login information across multiple platforms. The attackers aim to take over as many accounts as possible to steal personal and financial info, which gets sold on hacking forums or the dark web. However, the stolen information may also be used in identity theft scams to make unauthorized purchases or empty banking accounts linked to compromised accounts. In a data breach notification filed with the Main Attorney General's office, DraftKings disclosed that the data of 67,995 people was exposed in last month's incident. The company said the attackers obtained the credentials needed to log into the customers' accounts from a non-DraftKings source. ""In the event an account was accessed, among other things, the attacker could have viewed the account holder's name, address, phone number, email address, last four digits of payment card, profile photo, information about prior transactions, account balance, and last date of password change,"" the breach notification reads. ""At this time, there is currently no evidence that the attackers accessed your Social Security number, driver's license number or financial account number. ""While bad actors may have viewed the last four digits of your payment card, your full payment card number, expiration date, and your CVV are not stored in your account."" After detecting the attack, DraftKings reset the affected accounts' passwords and said it implemented additional fraud alerts. It also restored the funds withdrawn as a result of the credential attack, refunding up to $300,000 identified as stolen during the incident, as DraftKings President and Cofounder Paul Liberman said in November. The common denominator for user accounts that got hijacked seems to be an initial $5 deposit followed by a password change, enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) on a different phone number and then withdrawing as much as possible from the victims' linked bank accounts. While DraftKings has not shared additional info on how the attackers stole funds, BleepingComputer has since learned that the attack was conducted by a threat actor selling stolen accounts with deposit balances on an online marketplace for $10 to $35. The sales included instructions on how the buyers could make $5 deposits and withdraw all of the money from hijacked DraftKings user accounts. ​After DraftKings announced the credential stuffing attack, they locked down the breached accounts, with the threat actors warning that their campaign was no longer working. ​The company is now advising customers never to use the same password for multiple online services, never share their credentials with third-party platforms, turn on 2FA on their accounts immediately, and remove banking details or unlink their bank accounts to block future fraudulent withdrawal requests.​ As the FBI warned recently , credential stuffing attacks are quickly growing in volume due to readily available automated tools and aggregated lists of leaked credentials. In September, identity and access management company Okta also reported that the situation has drastically worsened this year since it recorded over 10 billion credential-stuffing events during the first three months of 2022. This amounts to roughly 34% of the overall authentication traffic tracked by Okta, which means that one in three sign-in attempts are malicious and fraudulent. It's budget season!

LiveAuctioneers is an auction site that allows people worldwide to bid on auctioned items in real-time. On July 10th, 2020, a data breach broker began selling a database that allegedly contains 3.4 million user records stolen from the LiveAuctioneers' site. BleepingComputer was told by the data broker that the database is being sold for $2,500. This data allegedly contains user's email addresses, usernames, MD5 hashed passwords, names, phone numbers, addresses, IP addresses, and social media profiles. In addition to the this data, the seller stated that 3 million of the accounts had their passwords decrypted, which were included in the sale. This type of data is a treasure trove for threat actors as it can be used in targeted phishing attacks and credential stuffing attacks at other sites The user records were later verified by cybersecurity intelligence firm CloudSEK who was able to confirm verify the data for various users listed in the sold database. ""Using public sources we were able to verify various fields such as mobile number, physical address and email address in the sample data. The sample has a mix of US and UK users’ data,"" CloudSEK stated in a report . On July 11th, a day after the database was listed for sale, LiveAuctioneers posted a security notification stating that they suffered a data breach. Accord to the data breach notification, the site's data was compromised on June 19th, 2020, after a ""LiveAuctioneers data processing partner"" was breached. ""As of July 11th, 2020, our cybersecurity team has confirmed that an unauthorized third party accessed certain user data through a security breach at a LiveAuctioneers data processing partner that occurred on June 19, 2020.,"" the data breach notification stated. They stress that credit card information was not accessed, and do not believe bidding history was affected. The information exposed in this data breach matches the data being sold on the hacker forum. After discovering the breach, LiveAuctioneers disabled the passwords for all bidder accounts and is requiring members to perform a password reset via the ""Forgot password"" link. If you are a LiveAuctioneers user and are worried that this breach has exposed your data, you should take the following steps. As your plain-text password may have been exposed, you should change your password on any site that uses the same credentials. When changing your password, be sure to use a unique and strong password at every site that you visit. Doing this prevents a data breach at one site affecting your account at other sites. You should also be on the lookout for phishing attacks targeting your LiveAuctioneer's member information and eBay accounts.

"Over 100,000 ChatGPT accounts stolen via info-stealing malware",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/over-100-000-chatgpt-accounts-stolen-via-info-stealing-malware/,Bill Toulas,"June 20, 2023","​More than 101,000 ChatGPT user accounts have been stolen by information-stealing malware over the past year, according to dark web marketplace data. Cyberintelligence firm Group-IB reports having identified over a hundred thousand info-stealer logs on various underground websites containing ChatGPT accounts, with the peak observed in May 2023, when threat actors posted 26,800 new ChatGPT credential pairs. Regarding the most targeted region, Asia-Pacific had almost 41,000 compromised accounts between June 2022 and May 2023, Europe had nearly 17,000, and North America ranked fifth with 4,700. Information stealers are a malware category that targets account data stored on applications such as email clients, web browsers, instant messengers, gaming services, cryptocurrency wallets, and others. These types of malware are known to steal credentials saved to web browsers by extracting them from the program's SQLite database and abusing the CryptProtectData function to reverse the encryption of the stored secrets. These credentials, and other stolen data, are then packaged into archives, called logs, and sent back to the attackers' servers for retrieval. ChatGPT accounts, alongside email accounts, credit card data, cryptocurrency wallet information, and other more traditionally targeted data types, signify the rising importance of AI-powered tools for users and businesses. Because ChatGPT allows users to store conversations, accessing one's account might mean gaining insights into proprietary information, internal business strategies, personal communications, software code, and more. ""Many enterprises are integrating ChatGPT into their operational flow,"" comments Group-IB's Dmitry Shestakov . ""Employees enter classified correspondences or use the bot to optimize proprietary code. Given that ChatGPT's standard configuration retains all conversations, this could inadvertently offer a trove of sensitive intelligence to threat actors if they obtain account credentials."" It is due to these concerns that tech giants like Samsung have outright banned staff from using ChatGPT on work computers, going as far as threatening to terminate the employment of those who fail to follow the policy. Group-IB's data indicates that the number of stolen ChatGPT logs has grown steadily over time, with almost 80% of all logs coming from the Raccoon stealer, followed by Vidar (13%) and Redline (7%). If you input sensitive data on ChatGPT, consider disabling the chat saving feature from the platform's settings menu or manually delete those conversations as soon as you are done using the tool. However, it should be noted that many information stealers snap screenshots of the infected system or perform keylogging, so even if you do not save conversations to your ChatGPT account, the malware infection could still lead to a data leak. Unfortunately, ChatGPT has already suffered a data breach where users saw other users' personal information and chat queries. Therefore, those working with extremely sensitive information shouldn't trust inputting it on any cloud-based services, but only on secured locally-built and self-hosted tools. Update 6/22 - An OpenAI spokesperson has sent BleepingComputer the following comment: The findings from Group-IB’s Threat Intelligence report is the result of commodity malware on people’s devices and not an OpenAI breach. We are currently investigating the accounts that have been exposed. OpenAI maintains industry best practices for authenticating and authorizing users to services including ChatGPT, and we encourage our users to use strong passwords and install only verified and trusted software to personal computers.

According to HIBP, StreetEasy was hit with a data breach in June 2016 that disclosed the information for close to 1 million users. This information included email addresses, names, passwords, and usernames, ""In approximately June 2016, the real estate website StreetEasy suffered a data breach. In total, 988k unique email addresses were included in the breach alongside names, usernames and SHA-1 hashes of passwords, all of which appeared for sale on a dark web marketplace in February 2019. The data was provided to HIBP by a source who requested it be attributed to ""JimScott.Sec@protonmail.com""."" HIBP also stated that Sephora Southeast Asia was breached in January 2017 and the data for 780,073 customers was stolen. The data stolen included customer's dates of birth, email addresses, ethnicities, genders, names, and physical attributes ""In approximately January 2017, the beauty store Sephora suffered a data breach.

American car rental giant Avis notified customers that unknown attackers breached one of its business applications last month and stole some of their personal information. According to data breach notification letters sent to impacted customers on Wednesday and filed with California's Office of the Attorney General, the company took action to stop the unauthorized access, launched an investigation with the help of external cybersecurity experts, and reported the incident to relevant authorities after learning of the breach on August 5. This investigation revealed that the attacker accessed its business applications from August 3 until August 6, when the company evicted the malicious actor from its systems and blocked its access. On August 14, it also found that the attacker stole some customers' personal information, including their names and other undisclosed sensitive data. As revealed in a separate filing with Maine's attorney general , the attackers stole the personal information of 299,006 Avis customers in the breach. ""We continue to further enhance our cybersecurity practices and defenses and are sending individual notifications to approximately 300,000 U.S. customers (less than 1% of our customer base) whose personal information was affected with offers of complimentary credit and identity monitoring services,"" an Avis spokesperson told BleepingComputer. Since the breach, Avis says it has worked with outside experts to strengthen security measures for the affected application and implemented additional safeguards across its systems. The company added that it's actively reviewing security monitoring and controls to bolster security defenses and warned customers of identity theft and fraud risks following the data breach. ""It is always a good idea to remain vigilant against threats of identity theft or fraud,"" Avis told those whose personal information was stolen in the incident. ""You can do this by regularly reviewing and monitoring your account statements and credit history for any signs of unauthorized transactions or activity. You can contact the credit reporting agencies if you suspect any unauthorized activity."" The car rental company also offered those affected a free one-year membership to Equifax's credit monitoring service, which assists with identity theft detection and resolution. Avis is a subsidiary of Avis Budget Group, a leading global mobility solutions provider that also owns Zipcar, the world's leading car-sharing network. Its Avis and Budget car rental brands operate over 10,000 rental locations in 180 countries across North America, Europe, and Australasia. Avis Budget Group has reported more than $3.0 billion in revenues for the second quarter of 2024. The company has not responded to multiple requests for comment from BleepingComputer asking for more information about the attack's nature, the number of affected customers, and the other personal information stolen in the breach.

Scandinavian Airlines says cyberattack caused passenger data leak,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/scandinavian-airlines-says-cyberattack-caused-passenger-data-leak/#comment_form,Bill Toulas,"February 16, 2023","Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) has posted a notice warning passengers that a recent multi-hour outage of its website and mobile app was caused by a cyberattack that also exposed customer data. The cyberattack caused some form of a malfunction on the airline's online system, causing passenger data to become visible to other passengers. This data includes contact details, previous and upcoming flights, as well the last four digits of the credit card number. The airline, which operates a fleet size of 131 aircraft and flies people to 168 destinations, says the risk of this exposure is minimal, as the leaked financial information is only partial and cannot be easily exploited. Also, it clarifies that no passport details have been exposed. However, full names and contact information is enough to allow threat actors and scammers to perform targeted phishing attacks if they accessed the exposed data during the attack. ""We always cooperate with the national CAA (Civil Aviation Agency), police, and security police when security matters are concerned – irrespective of the issue in question,"" concludes the SAS statement. ""We are monitoring the situation closely and continue the work to analyze and evaluate the attack and related consequences, as well as take preventive measures."" As reported by TheRecord , the attack on SAS was claimed by a group of so-called hacktivists called 'Anonymous Sudan,' who posted a statement about the attack on their Telegram channel. The threat actors state they attacked SAS due to an event that took place in front of the Turkish embassy in Stockholm, Sweden, on January 21, 2023, where a far-right nationalist group burnt a copy of the Holy Quran in protest to Turkey's objections over Sweden's NATO membership bid. This act has drawn condemnation from Muslims worldwide, Sudan included. SAS being the flagship carrier of Sweden (and also Denmark and Norway) became a target for hacktivists seeking to express their condemnation. The same group of actors hit SVT earlier this week, forcing Sweden's national public television broadcaster into a temporary outage. IT security experts questioned by SVT stated that it's likely that Russian hackers are conducting the attacks or at least aiding the Sudanese group with firepower and know-how.

"Over 400,000 corporate credentials stolen by info-stealing malware",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/over-400-000-corporate-credentials-stolen-by-info-stealing-malware/#comment_form,Bill Toulas,"July 25, 2023","The analysis of nearly 20 million information-stealing malware logs sold on the dark web and Telegram channels revealed that they had achieved significant infiltration into business environments. Information stealers are malware that steals data stored in applications such as web browsers, email clients, instant messengers, cryptocurrency wallets, FTP clients, and gaming services. The stolen information is packaged into archives called 'logs,' which are then uploaded back to the threat actor for use in attacks or sold on cybercrime marketplaces. The most prominent information-stealing families are Redline, Raccoon, Titan, Aurora, and Vidar, offered to cyber criminals on a subscription-based model, allowing them to conduct malware campaigns that steal data from infected devices. While information stealers primarily target careless internet users who download software, such as cracks, warez, game cheats, and fake software from dubious sources, it has also been found to have a massive impact on corporate environments. This is because employees use personal devices for work or access personal stuff from work computers, resulting in many info-stealer infections stealing business credentials and authentication cookies. More specifically, as cybersecurity firm Flare explains in a new report shared with BleepingComputer, there are approximately 375,000 logs containing access to business applications such as Salesforce, Hubspot, Quickbooks, AWS, GCP, Okta, and DocuSign. More specifically, Flare found the following in the examined stealer logs: In addition to the above, there are about 48,000 logs that include access to ""okta.com,"" an enterprise-grade identity management service used by organizations for cloud and on-premise user authentication. Most of these logs (74%) were posted on Telegram channels, while 25% were seen on Russian-speaking marketplaces, like the 'Russian Market.' ""Logs containing corporate access were over-represented on Russian Market and VIP Telegram channels, indicating that the methods attackers use to harvest logs may incidentally or intentionally have more corporate targeting,"" describes the Flare report. ""Additionally, public Telegram channels may deliberately post lower value logs, saving high-value logs for paying customers."" Flare also found more than 200,000 stealer logs containing OpenAI credentials, which is double the amount that Group-IB reported recently and constitutes a risk for leaking proprietary information, internal business strategies, source code, and more. Corporate credentials are considered ""tier-1"" logs, making them particularly high-valued in the cybercrime underground, where they are sold on private Telegram channels or forums like Exploit and XSS. That value is derived from the potential profit cybercriminals can make by leveraging compromised credentials to access CRMs, RDP, VPNs, and SaaS applications and then using that access to deploy stealthy backdoors, ransomware, and other payloads. ""Based on evidence from the dark web forum Exploit in, we rate it as highly likely that initial access brokers are using stealer logs as a principal source to gain an initial foothold to corporate environments that can then be auctioned off on top-tier dark web forums,"" explains Flare researcher Eric Clay. It is recommended that businesses minimize the risk of info-stealer malware infections by imposing the use of password managers, enforcing multi-factor authentication, and setting strict controls on personal device use. Furthermore, employees should be trained to identify and avoid common infection channels such as malicious Google Ads, YouTube videos, and Facebook posts.

A filing with the Office of Maine's Attorney General revealed that the incident impacted 538,959 individuals. The attackers gained access to the affected people's names, Social Security numbers, and other personal identifiers. ""On or about December 24, 2023, the Ohio Lottery detected unauthorized access to our internal office network as a result of a cybersecurity incident that resulted in the exposure of the data we maintain.

""After an extensive forensic investigation and our manual document review, we learned on April 5, 2024 that certain files containing your personal information was subject to unauthorized access."" Ohio Lottery says that no evidence was found that the stolen information had been used for fraud. Still, it provides free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services to all potentially impacted individuals ""out of an abundance of caution."" While the Ohio Lottery didn't reveal the nature of the incident, which affected mobile and prize-cashing operations, the DragonForce ransomware gang claimed the attack days later. The threat actors claimed they encrypted devices and stole documents belonging to both Ohio Lottery customers and employees. An entry added to the ransomware group's dark web leak site on December 27 said the attackers stole over 3 million records. After negotiations failed, the gang leaked four .bak archives and multiple CSV files on January 22, allegedly stolen from Ohio Lottery's systems. ​DragonForce says the 94 GB of leaked data contains only 1.500.000 records with Ohio Lottery clients' names, Social Security numbers, and dates of birth. While DragonForce ransomware is a relatively new operation that exposed its first victim in December 2023, the tactics, negotiation style, and data leak site suggest an experienced extortion group. Since their leak site now lists almost four dozen victims and law enforcement has been disrupting many ransomware operations in recent months, it wouldn't be surprising if this was a rebrand of a previously known gang. DragonForce ransomware also claimed a cyberattack that impacted Japanese probiotic beverage manufacturer Yakult's IT systems in Australia and New Zealand in mid-December.

Skimmers are snippets of JavaScript code injected on order checkout pages to steal inputted payment card details from customers, in this case, people who bought a ticket to a live entertainment event. According to a data breach notification shared with the Montana Attorney General's office, See Tickets discovered the breach in April 2021, when they started an investigation with the help of a forensics firm. However, it wasn't until January 8, 2022, that the malicious code was fully removed from its site. After engaging with forensic experts and Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover to investigate the incident further, See Tickets concluded on September 12, 2022, that unauthorized parties may have accessed customer credit card information. The internal investigation showed that the infection happened on June 25, 2019, so the total duration of the exposure was just over 2.5 years. The customer information that the hackers might have stolen includes the following data: See Tickets says Social Security Numbers, state identification numbers, or bank account information have not been exposed due to this incident, as they're not stored in its systems. Due to the type of data the hackers stole, See Tickets warns that users should be vigilant against unauthorized credit card transactions and identity theft. Threat actors commonly use stolen credit card information to purchase goods from online stores and then sell them to private individuals for money laundering. The proceedings of these sales are often bounced through ""money mule"" networks before they reach the crooks to obscure their trace. Additionally, the notice urges the impacted recipients to remain vigilant against phishing emails or other unsolicited communication and monitor credit card statements for suspicious charges. Unfortunately, See Tickets has not offered a free-of-charge identity protection service for the impacted individuals, so exposed customers were left on their own to deal with the consequences of the security breach.

The breach came to light at the end of October when an anonymous user alerted Lowyat.net , a Kuala Lumpur-based technology site, about data belonging to millions of Malaysians being sold online on the Dark Web. After news broke of the incident, the data became a must-have for all hackers and quickly spread as a free download on a variety of underground hacking forums. The stolen data contained information on 46.2 million mobile numbers from almost all of Malaysia telephony providers, including Altel, Celcom, DiGi, Enabling Asia, Friendimobile, Maxis, MerchantTradeAsia, PLDT, RedTone, TuneTalk, Umobile, and XOX. Included in the shared files were telephone numbers and names for each subscriber, and highly sensitive details such as identity card numbers, home addresses, IMSI, IMEI, and SIM numbers. The data also contained private details for more than 80,000 individuals from records stolen from the Malaysian Medical Council, the Malaysian Medical Association, and the Malaysian Dental Association. All stolen data appears to have been stolen no later than July 2014. In a press conference today, Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Mohamad Fuzi Harun said investigators have pinpointed the possible culprits, which they believe to be the employees of a company that was involved with the transfer of the stolen data. Mohamad Fuzi did not detail what kind of transfer took place, nor how many people they suspect to be involved, but said the fault does not appear to be with any of the telcos. Malaysian police have not made any arrests at the time of writing. Instead, another state agency —the Data Privacy Protection Department (JPDP)— intervened and blocked a website set up by Malaysian security researcher Keith Rozaria that allowed victims to search and see if they were included in the leaked data. The site —located at SayaKenaHack.com — was blocked locally. Rozaria responded by setting up a mirror to bypass ISP filters. This is not the first hack to affect an entire country. Similar mega-breaches have also taken place in the Philippines (55 million), Turkey (50 million), and South Africa (30 million).

However, it appears to just be a compilation of previously leaked credentials stolen by infostealers, exposed in data breaches, and via credential stuffing attacks. To be clear, this is not a new data breach, or a breach at all, and the websites involved were not recently compromised to steal these credentials. Instead, these stolen credentials were likely circulating for some time, if not for years. It was then collected by a cybersecurity firm, researchers, or threat actors and repackaged into a database that was exposed on the Internet. Cybernews, which discovered the briefly exposed datasets of compiled credentials, stated it was stored in a format commonly associated with infostealer malware, though they did not share samples An infostealer is malware that attempts to steal credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, and other data from an infected device. Over the years, infostealers have become a massive problem, leading to breaches worldwide. These types of malware impact both Windows and Macs, and when executed, will gather all the credentials it can find stored on a device and save them in what is called a ""log."" An infostealer log is generally an archive containing numerous text files and other stolen data. The text files contain lists of credentials stolen from browsers, files, and other applications. Stolen credentials are usually saved one per line in the following format: Sometimes, the delimiter between each component is changed to a comma, semicolon, or dash. For example, the following is how an infostealer will save credentials stolen from a device to a log: If someone is infected with an infostealer and has a thousand credentials saved in their browser, the infostealer will steal them all and store them in the log. These logs are then uploaded to the threat actor, where the credentials can be used for further attacks or sold on cybercrime marketplaces. The infostealer problem has gotten so bad and pervasive that compromised credentials have become one of the most common ways for threat actors to breach networks. We have a webinar next month titled "" Stolen credentials: The New Front Door to Your Network "" that focuses on infostealers, compromised credentials, and how organizations can protect themselves. This problem has also led law enforcement worldwide to actively crack down on these cybercrime operations in recent actions, such as "" Operation Secure "" and the disruption of LummaStealer . As infostealers have become so abundant and commonly used, threat actors release massive compilations for free on Telegram, Pastebin, and Discord to gain reputation among the cybercrime community or as teasers to paid offerings. To see how many passwords are given away for free, the single 1,261.4 MB file in the image above contained over 64,000 credential pairs. There are thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of similarly leaked archives being shared online, resulting in billions of credentials records released for free. Many of these free archives were likely compiled into massive data sets that were briefly exposed and seen by Cybernews. Similar credential collections were released in the past, such as the RockYou2024 leak , with over 9 billion records, and "" Colection #1 ,"" which contained over 22 million unique passwords. Despite the buzz, there's no evidence this compilation contains new or previously unseen data So, now that you know there was a massive leak of credentials likely stolen through infostealers, data breaches, and credential-stuffing attacks, you may be wondering what you should do. The most important step is to adopt and maintain good cybersecurity habits you should already be following. If you're concerned that an infostealer might be present on your computer, scan your device with a trusted antivirus program before changing any passwords. Otherwise, newly entered credentials could be stolen as well. Once you're confident your system is clean, focus on improving your password hygiene. That means using a unique, strong password for every site you use, and relying on a password manager to keep them organized and secure. However, even unique passwords won't help you stay protected if you are hacked, fall for a phishing attack, or install malware. Therefore, it is crucial that you also use two-factor authentication (2FA) along with an authentication app, like Microsoft Authenticator , Google Authenticator , or Authy , to manage your 2FA codes. Some password managers, like Bitwarden and 1Password, also include authentication functionality, allowing you to use one application for both. With 2FA enabled, even if a password at a site is compromised, threat actors cannot access the account without your 2FA code. As a general rule, you should avoid using SMS texts to receive 2FA codes, as threat actors can conduct SIM-swapping attacks to hijack your phone number and obtain them. As for this leak, with this many credentials leaked, there is a chance one of the readers of this article will be listed in the compilation. However, don't panic and stress about it, running around changing all your passwords. Instead, take this opportunity to improve your cybersecurity habits. To check if your credentials have appeared in known breaches, consider using services like Have I Been Pwned . And if you use the same password across multiple sites, now is the time to switch to unique ones. That way, leaks like this become far less dangerous to you.

The City began notifying potentially impacted individuals on September 23 that, among the sensitive personal information exposed during the incident, the attacker could have accessed the affected individuals' names and Social Security numbers. ""On September 12, this review concluded, and the review determined that the information at issue included certain personal information,"" the City revealed in a separate announcement on its official website. ""The information within the potentially accessed files included certain individuals' name, Social Security number, driver's license or state identification number, and passport number.""

Temu denies breach after hacker claims theft of 87 million data records,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/temu-denies-breach-after-hacker-claims-theft-of-87-million-data-records/#comment_form,Bill Toulas,"September 17, 2024","Temu denies it was hacked or suffered a data breach after a threat actor claimed to be selling a stolen database containing 87 million records of customer information. The threat actor put the alleged data up for sale yesterday on the BreachForums hacking forum, along with a small sample to serve as proof of the stolen data. Temu says it has examined and cross-checked the data samples with its database, but no matches were found. Temu is a rapidly growing e-commerce platform offering a wide range of products at competitive prices, focusing on low-cost clothing, home goods, electronics, and accessories. Temu is Chinese but operates globally, including in Europe and the United States, where it gained popularity for its deep discounts and promotional strategies. Though Temu has faced scrutiny over concerns relating to data privacy, product quality, and shipping times, it has not found itself at the epicenter of a major data breach incident as of yet. Yesterday, a threat actor using the moniker 'smokinthashit' claimed to have stolen a database with 87 million records from Temu and attempted to sell it to other cybercriminals. The threat actor published samples of the allegedly stolen data that contained usernames and IDs, IP addresses, full names, dates of birth, gender, shipping addresses, phone numbers, and hashed passwords. Responding to BleepingComputer's request for comment, Temu categorically denied the published data is theirs and said it would press charges against those spreading this misinformation. ""Temu's security team has conducted a comprehensive investigation into the alleged data breach and can confirm that the claims are categorically false; the data being circulated is not from our systems. Not a single line of data matches our transaction records,"" Temu told BleepingComputer. ""We take any attempt to tarnish our reputation or harm our users extremely seriously and reserve the right to pursue legal action against those responsible for spreading false information and attempting to profit from such malicious activities."" ""At Temu, the security and privacy of our users are paramount. We follow industry-leading practices for data protection and cybersecurity, ensuring that consumers can shop with peace of mind on our platform."" The e-commerce platform also underlined that it follows industry-leading data protection and cybersecurity practices, noting the app's MASA certification, independent validations, its HackerOne bug bounty program, and compliance with the PCI DSS payment security standard. BleepingComputer contacted the threat actor about the breach, and they continued to say they breached Temu. The threat actor claims to still have access to the company's email and internal panels, and that there are vulnerabilities in their code. However, the threat actor did not share any proof of these claims, and BleepingComputer cannot determine whether they are valid. Whether or not the data breach claims are valid, they can still harm a firm's reputation and seed distrust in customers. Out of an abundance of caution, if you are a Temu user, it would be prudent to enable two-factor authentication on your account, change the password to something new and unique, and stay vigilant for potential phishing attempts. BleepingComputer contacted Temu again about these further claims, but no response was immediately available. Update 9/19 : The threat actor has been banned on BreachForums for miserepresenting and attempting to sell data that was already publicly available. CheckPoint Research investigating on that claim told BleepingComputer that some of the information the threat actor posted appears to originate from a data breach at foreup.com, dating back to mid-2021.

Capital One notifies more clients of SSNs exposed in 2019 data breach,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/capital-one-notifies-more-clients-of-ssns-exposed-in-2019-data-breach/,Sergiu Gatlan,"April 2, 2021","US bank Capital One notified additional customers that their Social Security numbers were exposed in a data breach announced in July 2019. The day the breach was disclosed, the Department of Justice arrested and indicted the suspected hacker, former Amazon Web Services (AWS) employee Paige Thompson, who posted about stealing data on GitHub after infiltrating Capital One's AWS cloud servers. Thompson allegedly stole over 100 million people's personal information, including names, email addresses, dates of birth, transaction data, credit scores, payment history, balances, and for some, linked bank accounts and social security numbers. The suspect also gained access to roughly 140,000 Social Security numbers and around 80,000 linked bank account numbers of credit card customers. Thompson also used the compromised servers to mine for cryptocurrency, according to the indictment . Capital One was not the only organization hacked by the attacker, with media reporting that the list of breached companies might also include Vodafone, Ford, Unicredit, the Ohio Department of Transportation, and Michigan State University. While the breach notification letters might seem out of place almost two years after the incident, they were prompted by new findings while analyzing data stolen during the 2019 security breach. However, after re-analyzing the stolen data using new tools, the bank discovered that the hacker did gain access and stole some of its customers' SSNs. ""Immediately after the 2019 data security incident, we conducted an analysis with the assistance of an external third-party expert to determine what information was accessed by the unauthorized individual,"" Capital One said . ""At that time, we did not identify you as one of the individuals whose Social Security number was part of the accessed data."" ""Recently, Capital One re-examined the files that were impacted by the 2019 data security incident using new and more advanced tools. As part of this analysis, we determined that your Social Security number was among the data to which the unauthorized individual gained access."" According to Capital One, the bank notified customers of this additional exposed personal information even though there is no evidence that it was disseminated or used for fraud. Capital One said that the incident is expected to generate costs of $100 to $150 million due to customer notifications, free credit monitoring services, security improvement costs, and legal fees. However, the bank also added that it had cybersecurity insurance that will cover up to $400 million with a $10 million deductible. Last year, Capital One was fined $80 million by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the US banking regulator, for its failure to protect its customers' personal and financial information. ""The OCC took these actions based on the bank's failure to establish effective risk assessment processes prior to migrating significant information technology operations to the public cloud environment and the bank's failure to correct the deficiencies in a timely manner,"" OCC said.

The company disclosed the attack on May 27, when it linked ongoing service outages to a ransomware incident that disrupted access to some internal systems and online applications for its staff and customers. Impacted services included multi-factor authentication (MFA), account SSO (Single Sign-On), the MathWorks cloud center, file exchange, license center, and the online store. In a recent filing with Maine's Attorney General, the company said that it discovered the incident on May 18, more than one month after the attackers gained access to its systems. According to the same filing, the attackers stole the data of 10,476 individuals. MathWorks also revealed in data breach notification letters filed with the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office that the ransomware gang behind the April cyberattack stole documents containing personal information of affected individuals. Depending on the impacted individual, this stolen information includes a combination of names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security Numbers, and/or other non-U.S. national identification numbers. Although it has already confirmed that it was the victim of a ransomware attack, MathWorks has yet to reveal additional details regarding this incident, including the name of the ransomware operation behind the breach. Additionally, no ransomware gang has claimed responsibility for the breach, which suggests that MathWorks is still in negotiations or has already paid the ransom demanded by the attackers. Founded in 1984 and Headquartered in Natick, Massachusetts, MathWorks has over 6,500 employees in 34 offices worldwide.

Australian loan giant Latitude Financial Services (Latitude) has released an updated data breach notification warning customers that the breach is much more significant than initially stated, taking the number of affected individuals from 328,000 to 14 million. On March 16, 2023, the Australian personal loan and financial service provider disclosed a cyber-incident where a threat actor stole an employee's login to breach two of the company's service providers holding Latitude's customer data. At that time, the company estimated that the intruder accessed about 328k customer records, mostly driver's licenses. Latitude's response included shutting down customer-facing systems to contain the attack while the investigations to reveal the full scope of the impact continued. Unfortunately, after further investigating the incident, Latitude has revealed that the impact of the incident is much more significant, now believed to have affected 14 million customers or loan applicants from Australia and New Zealand. ""As our forensic review continues to progress, we have identified that approximately 7.9 million Australian and New Zealand driver license numbers were stolen, of which approximately 3.2 million, or 40%, were provided to us in the last 10 years,"" reads the new statement . ""A further approximately 6.1 million records dating back to at least 2005 were also stolen, of which approximately 5.7 million, or 94%, were provided before 2013."" The 6.1 million customer records also include customers' full names, addresses, telephone numbers, and dates of birth. Additionally, Latitude has found that the attackers stole approximately 53,000 passport numbers. Latitude says they will reimburse those wishing to replace their stolen ID documents and recommend customers monitor their credit reports for fraudulent activity. Instructions on enrolling for the protection services are enclosed in the notifications sent to impacted individuals and on the public statement. The Australian Federal Police (AFP), which assists Latitude in the ongoing investigations, has also announced that it is expanding ""Operation Guardian"" to help protect Latitude's customers from cybercriminals attempting to exploit the leaked personal data.

Fake data breach alerts used to steal Ledger cryptocurrency wallets,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-data-breach-alerts-used-to-steal-ledger-cryptocurrency-wallets/,Lawrence Abrams,"December 10, 2020","A phishing scam is underway that targets Ledger wallet users with fake data breach notifications used to steal cryptocurrency from recipients. Ledger is a hardware cryptocurrency wallet that allows you to store, manage, and sell cryptocurrency. The funds held in these wallets are secured using a 24-word recovery phrase and supports 12, 18, or 24-word recovery phrases used by other wallets. Anyone who knows this recovery phrase can use it to access the funds that it secures. Therefore, recovery phrases must be kept offline and private so that cryptocurrency funds are not stolen. In July 2020, Ledger suffered a data breach after a website vulnerability allowed threat actors to access customers' contact details. At the time of the breach, Ledger stated that they emailed the affected 9,500 customers and provided a dedicated email that can be used for more information about the attack. Starting in October 2020, Ledger users began receiving fake emails about a new data breach from Ledger. The email stated that the user was affected by the breach and that they should install the latest version of Ledger Live to secure their assets with a new pin. ""We regret to inform you that we have been alerted of a data breach affecting confidential data belonging to approximately 115,000 of our customers, which includes personal information, PIN-encrypted private and public keys, as well as the amount of each cryptocurrency stored inside the wallet,"" the fake Ledger data breach phishing email reads. These emails contain links to domain names using Punycode characters that allow the attackers to impersonate the legitimate Ledger.com using accented or Cyrillic characters. For example, a lookalike domain currently being used is https://ledģėr.com, which, at a glance, appears to be the legitimate Ledger site. This fake site prompts users to download Ledger Live applications, as shown below. If a visitor downloads the mobile Ledger Live app, they will be redirected to the legitimate Apple and Google app pages. On the other hand, if they try to download the desktop version, it will download a fake Ledger Live application from the Ledger phishing site. As you can see below, the legitimate Ledger Live application is signed using a certificate for ""Ledger SAS"" (left) and the fake Windows version [ VirusTotal ] is signed as ""Source Code Solutions Limited"" (left), When installed, the fake Ledger Live application is designed to be almost identical to the legitimate version, minus some choices when you startup the program. When you launch the fake software, it will prompt you with two choices - 'Restore devices from Recovery phrase' or 'Don't have a Ledger device.' As the user reached this malicious site because the data breach notification told them to reset their PIN, most will click on the restore device option. When doing so, the application displays a screen asking you to enter your recovery phrase. After users enter their recovery phrase, the secret phrase will be sent back to the threat actors at the domain happyflyingcow.com. Now that the threat actors have your recovery phrase, they can try to steal your cryptocurrency assets. As some Ledger users add additional security in the form of a secret passphrase to their wallets, the phishing app will ask for that passphrase as well. Once you enter the secret passphrase, the phishing application will now send both your recovery phrase and secret passphrase back to the attackers at happyflyingcow.com. Armed with both the recovery phrase and the secret passphrase, the attackers can gain full access to your cryptocurrency funds and steal them. First and foremost, never enter your recovery phrase or secret passphrase in any app or website. It should only be entered directly on the Ledger device you are trying to recover. As it is easy to create lookalike domains that impersonate legitimate sites, when it comes to cryptocurrency and financial assets, always type the domain you're trying to reach into your browser rather than relying on links in emails. This way, you know you are going to ledger.com rather than a site impersonating it. Finally, disregard any emails claiming to be from Ledger stating that you were affected by a recent data breach. If you are concerned, rather than click on the link in these emails, contact Ledger directly for more information. Ledger has told BleepingComputer that they plan on publishing a phishing status page next week to provide information about these attacks. Thx to Andreas Tasch , Nicodaemos, and Craael for sharing their phishing samples. Update 12/11/20: Updated article to state that you should only enter recovery phrase directly on device.

Macy's Customer Payment Info Stolen in Magecart Data Breach,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/macys-customer-payment-info-stolen-in-magecart-data-breach/,Lawrence Abrams,"November 18, 2019","Macy's has announced that they have suffered a data breach due to their web site being hacked with malicious scripts that steal customer's payment information. This type of compromise is called MageCart attack and consists of hackers compromising a web site so that they can inject malicious JavaScript scripts into various sections of the web site. These scripts then steal payment information that is submitted by a customer. According to a ' Notice of Data Breach ' issued by Macy's, their web site was hacked on October 7th, 2019 and a malicious script was added to the 'Checkout' and 'My Wallet' pages. If any payment information was submitted on these pages while they were compromised, the credit card details and customer information was sent to a remote site under the attacker's control. ""On October 15, 2019, we were alerted to a suspicious connection between macys.com and another website. Our security teams immediately began an investigation. Based on our investigation, we believe that on October 7, 2019 an unauthorized third party added unauthorized computer code to two (2) pages on macys.com. The unauthorized code was highly specific and only allowed the third party to capture information submitted by customers on the following two (2) macys.com pages: (1) the checkout page - if credit card data was entered and “place order” button was hit; and (2) the wallet page - accessed through My Account. Our teams successfully removed the unauthorized code on October 15, 2019."" As part of this breach, attackers were able to access customer information and credit card information that includes the customer's first name, last name, address, city, state,zip, phone number, email address, payment card number, payment card security code, and payment card month/year of expiration if submitted on a compromised page. Macy's states that they were alerted to this hack on October 15th, 2019, a full week after the site was breached and attackers were collecting payment information. After the web site was cleaned, Macy's notified law enforcement and hired ""a leading class forensics firm"" to help with their investigation. They have also contacted all relevant credit card brands including Visa, American Express, Discover, and Mastercard to notify them of this breach. Macy's told BleepingComputer that only a small amount of customers were affected and that they instituted additional security measures so this does not happen again. ""We are aware of a data security incident involving a small number of our customers on Macys.com,"" Macy's told BleepingComputer in a statement. ""We have investigated the matter thoroughly, addressed the cause and have implemented additional security measures as a precaution. All impacted customers have been notified, and we are offering consumer protections to these customers at no cost."" Macy's has started sending out emails to those who were affected and advise them to monitor their credit card statement for suspicious or fraudulent activity. If anything is detected, consumers should immediately contact their credit card company and dispute the charge. Macy's is also offering all users who were affected by this breach a free year of the Experian IdentityWorks credit monitoring service. Users will be able to sign up with the enclosed instructions and unique ID assigned to them. A researcher who wishes to remain anonymous at this time, reported the Magecart attack to Macy's and shared some of its details with BleepingComputer. When the attackers compromised the Macy's website, they altered the https://www.macys.com/js/min/common/util/ClientSideErrorLog.js script to include an obfuscated Magecart script. The researcher told us that when a customer submitted their payment information, this script would launch and send the submitted information to a command and control server at Barn-x.com/api/analysis.php. The attackers could then access any stolen payment information by logging into the command and control server. Update 11/18/19 : Added information about the magecart script and the C2 server.

Aside from the affected user, we currently believe that no other accounts or systems at SANS were compromised,"" states the SANS data incident notification . The threat actor then proceeded to configure a rule that forwarded all email received in this account to an ""unknown external email address"" and installed a malicious Office 365 add-on. SANS has not provided much information about this add-on, but it likely an Office 365 Oauth app used to gain persistence to the email account. This configured rule forwarded a total of 513 emails, with some containing a total of approximately 28,000 records of personal information (PII) for SANS members. This information does not include passwords or financial information such as credit cards, does include email addresses, full names, phone numbers, work title, company names, and physical addresses. As a cybersecurity training organization, few entities are better equipped to perform the incident response into this compromise using their own personnel. As such, SANS states that their digital forensics instructions are heading up the investigation and are working to make sure no other systems are compromised and harden their existing systems and security. As an educational opportunity, SANS states that they will host a webcast that includes information about this incident that would be useful to the greater security community. ""SANS digital forensics instructors are heading up the investigation. We are working to ensure that no other information was compromised and to identify opportunities to harden our systems and improve our response. When the investigation is complete, we will run a webcast to outline our learnings if there is information that we think would be useful to the community."" Those affected are being notified and should be on the lookout for targeted phishing attacks utilizing the stolen information.

French unemployment agency data breach impacts 43 million people,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/french-unemployment-agency-data-breach-impacts-43-million-people/,Bill Toulas,"March 14, 2024","France Travail, formerly known as Pôle Emploi, is warning that hackers breached its systems and may leak or exploit personal details of an estimated 43 million individuals. France Travail is the French governmental agency responsible for registering unemployed individuals, providing financial aid, and assisting them in finding jobs. Yesterday, the agency disclosed that hackers stole details belonging to job seekers registered with the agency in the last 20 years in a cyberattack between February 6 and March 5. Data from individuals with a job candidate profile was also exposed. A notice on France’s portal for assisting victims of cyberattacks informs that affected individuals will receive a notification from the agency regarding the personal data violation as a result of the incident. France Travail has informed the country’s data protection agency, the National Commission of Informatique and Liberties (CNIL), which stated that up to 43 million people may be impacted. The types of the data that have been exposed from this attack include: This data increases the risk of identity theft and phishing for the exposed individuals, so the agency recommends potentially impacted people to be particularly vigilant with emails, phone calls, and SMS they receive. France Travail clarified that the data breach incident does not impact people’s bank details or account passwords, but CNIL warns that cybercriminals may use what’s available to correlate with missing data points from other breaches. Those impacted by the data breach incident at France Travail can file a complaint with the Paris prosecutor’s office to help with the investigation. Last August, France Travail suffered a massive data breach, which impacted approximately 10 million individuals . That incident was indirectly attributed to the Clop ransomware group breaching the agency's systems by exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in the MOVEit Transfer software tool. The current cyberattack on the agency sets a new record in France, as it affects the largest number of individuals, more than the 33 million people impacted by the Viamedis and Almerys breach in February.

Over 460 million records exposed in breach incidents reported in May,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/over-460-million-records-exposed-in-breach-incidents-reported-in-may/#comment_form,Ionut Ilascu,"June 1, 2020","At least 460 million records were exposed in data breach incidents that were reported in May. The figure is a very conservative estimate as it reflects only publicly reported events. In many cases, the amount of data exposed to unauthorized users was not provided, so the number is likely much higher. While not all the records represent sensitive or personally identifiable information and it is a highly cautious count, it is a worrying result. IT Governance, a provider of cyber risk and privacy management solutions, compiled a list of publicly disclosed cyber incidents that impacted data records from various services around the world. The company counted 8.8 billion records exposed in May but 8.3 came from a single incident at AIS mobile operator in Thailand, who exposed a database of DNS query and NetFlow logs. With this event, IT Governance counted 105 incidents that exposed over 8.8 billion records. Adding the numbers from major incidents, we stopped counting at 460 million. The list also has many entries where the compromised records is unknown. In a breakdown of the incidents, the same source attributes 39 of them to cyber attacks, 37 to data breaches, 17 to ransomware attacks , and six to insider threats or other types of cyber events. It is worth highlighting that not all the records are sufficiently valuable for attackers to use but they can provide the necessary context for an attack. Reports for previous months from the company show that April was the month with the smallest number of records exposed as a result of data breaches and cyber attacks: 216 million from 49 publicly reported incidents. Monthly reports show that in March there were 67 incidents reported, cumulating at least 832 million records. Before that, in February, 623.5 million records were exposed in 105 incidents. January shows with the largest number of exposed records, 1.5 billion from 61 incidents. Most of that figure, though, is from a report in November 2019 from vulnerability analysis and management company Greenbone Networks, who found medical data exposed on the internet. Despite these inconsistencies, data breaches and leaks are showing up more frequently in media reports. However, what gets into the public space reflects only a fraction of the current reality. In many cases, the victims learn of the intrusion at a much later time or don’t learn about it at all. Others, don’t even report the incidents for fear of fines and losing their customers. Hackers are constantly trading or selling smaller data sets that do not capture media attention. There multiple actors that steal databases and either extort owners for money or sell them. These incidents are usually noticed only when the activity is on a larger scale.

Sears and Delta Airlines Suffer Card Breaches via Shared Live Chat Provider,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sears-and-delta-airlines-suffer-card-breaches-via-shared-live-chat-provider/,Catalin Cimpanu,"April 5, 2018","The customers of at least two major US companies —department store chain Sears and Delta Airlines— might have had their payment card details stolen due to a hack at a common software supplier. The hacked company is [24]7.ai, a San Jose-based company that provides various customers support services, including live chat systems and AI-assisted chatbots. The company revealed on Wednesday that an unauthorized party gained access to its network, from where it collected customer payment information for a small number of client companies. [24]7.ai did not reveal any customer names, but on the same day, both Sears and Delta Airlines published press releases revealing they were two of the victims. Delta says the attacker managed to get its hands on information such as the card holder's name, address, card number, CVV number, and expiration date. Delta didn't reveal how many passengers were affected but said the attacker didn't gain access to passport or government ID details, nor to data hosted in the SkyMiles program. On the other hand, Sears put a number on the breach, revealing the attacker had access to less than 100,000 payment card numbers. While [24]7.ai remained mum on the incident revealing very few details, Delta Airlines says the attacker managed to infect the chat provider's network with malware on September 26, 2017. [24]7.ai discovered and removed the malware from its network on October 12. The chat provider then spent five and a half months investigating the incident together with law enforcement. Only in late March did [24]7.ai notify Sears, Delta, and the other affected companies of the incident, so they could, in turn, tell their own customers. Despite being [24]7.ai's fault, Delta is now providing free credit monitoring services to all affected customers. Both Delta and Spears are warning users who utilized their website to make orders to keep an eye on card statements for suspicious transactions. Customers did not have to interact with the online chat tool to be impacted. However, Sears and Delta aren't the only companies that suffered card breaches this week. On Monday, news surfaced that PaneraBread might have exposed the card details of millions of customers after ignoring a security researcher's warnings for more than eight months. Also on Monday, news also surfaced that hacking group FIN7 had stolen and put up for sale card details for over five million customers of high-end luxury store chain Saks, Lord & Taylor. Update [April 6]: Post-publication, Best Buy, too, admitted to have been affected by the [24]7.ai cyber-incident. The store chain did not reveal how many customers were affected. It's budget season!

UScellular discloses data breach after billing system hack,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/uscellular-discloses-data-breach-after-billing-system-hack/,Sergiu Gatlan,"January 4, 2022","UScellular, self-described as the fourth-largest wireless carrier in the US, has disclosed a data breach after the company's billing system was hacked in December 2021. The mobile carrier said in data breach notification letters sent to 405 impacted individuals that the attackers also ported some of the affected customers' numbers using personal information stolen in the incident. ""On December 13, 2021, UScellular detected a data security incident in 'which unauthorized individuals illegally accessed our billing system and gained access to wireless customer accounts that contain personal information,"" the carrier explained. ""Unauthorized individuals attempted to leverage access to that information to fraudulently port numbers. Based on our investigation, we believe that the incident occurred on December 13-19, 2021."" After hacking into UScellular's CRM system, the attackers could also view customers' account information, including their phone numbers and addresses. ""Information in customer accounts include name, address, PIN code and cellular telephone number(s) as well as information about wireless services including service plan, usage and billing statements,"" UScellular said. ""Sensitive personal information, such as Social Security number and credit card information, is masked within the CRM system. At this time, we have no indication that there has been unauthorized access to your UScellular online user account."" While UScellular did not say if any of its employees' accounts were compromised in this security breach, the company reset an undisclosed number of retail store login employee credentials. The mobile carrier also reset the impacted customers' security questions, answers, and personal identification numbers (PIN) linked to their accounts. ""Upon discovery of the incident, UScellular immediately disconnected the computer accessed by the unauthorized individuals from the internet and requested immediate removal from the internet of the fraudulent websites used by the fraudsters as part of the scheme,"" UScellular added. Impacted UScellular customers are advised to be on the lookout for targeted phishing scams using personal information stolen from the company's CRM systems. This is the second data breach that hit UScellular in 2021 after hackers were also able to gain access to the carrier's CRM software in January 2021. Just as following the December breach, the threat actors were also able to successfully port some UScellular customers' numbers which would allow them to steal two-factor authentication codes sent via text messages and, potentially, hijack the victims' online accounts.

Data Breach at Website with 45 Million Users Discovered During Academic Research,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/data-breach-at-website-with-45-million-users-discovered-during-academic-research/,Catalin Cimpanu,"December 14, 2017","A team of three researchers from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) has created a tool that can detect when user-registration-based websites suffer a data breach. The tool, named Tripwire, works on a simple concept. Researchers say that Tripwire registers one or more accounts on websites by using a unique email address that they do not use for anything else. Each email account and the website profile used the same password. Tripwire would check at regular intervals if someone used this password to access the email account, which would indicate the website suffered a breach and an attacker used the stolen account data to log into the associated email account. In a live test, researchers said they registered accounts at over 2,300 sites. At the end of the study's period, scientists said that attackers accessed email accounts for 19 of these sites, including one with a userbase of over 45 million. UCSD researchers reached out to each website, but to their astonishment, none notified users of the breach. ""I was heartened that the big sites we interacted with took us seriously,"" said Alex C. Snoeren, professor of computer science at the Jacobs School of Engineering at the University of California San Diego, and one of Tripwire's four authors together with Joe DeBlasio, Stefan Savage, and Geoffrey M. Voelker. ""I was somewhat surprised no one acted on our results,"" Snoeren added, saying his team won't disclose the websites' names. ""The reality is that these companies didn’t volunteer to be part of this study. By doing this, we’ve opened them up to huge financial and legal exposure. So we decided to put the onus on them to disclose."" But the research didn't end here. The simple concept behind Tripwire also exposes when websites store passwords in plaintext, researchers said. For example, researchers say someone could use Tripwire to record multiple honeytrap accounts on the same websites, some with a simple password, and others with very complex and lengthy passphrases. If an attacker accesses both, this means the website stores password information in plaintext, or another easy-to-break password hashing system like MD5. If only accounts with the simple passwords are accessed, this means the website stores passwords in a secure manner, and an attacker might have used a basic brute-force dictionary attack to guess some user passwords. In addition, researchers said they also carried out extra tests to determine if the breach took place at the actual website or the email provider that hosted the email address. They said they created more than 100,000 email accounts to serve as control accounts. If an attacker accessed only the email addresses associated with online profiles, but not any of the other 100,000 test accounts, then this meant the breach took place at the third-party website, and not the email provider. UCSC researchers published the source code for the Tripwire tool on GitHub , and they hope that companies would deploy it internally as an additional breach detection system. The research team also presented their work on Tripwire at the ACM Internet Measurement Conference in London, this November. Their work on Tripwire is documented in a research paper titled "" Tripwire: Inferring Internet Site Compromise .""

The American crypto exchange began sending notices to impacted individuals a month ago, on June 26, 2024 but submitted a sample of the letters yesterday to the Attorney General's Office in California. According to the notification, Gemini suffered a third-party data breach when an unauthorized actor breached its vendor's systems between June 3 and June 7, 2024. The incident affected some of Gemini's customers' banking information, including their full name, bank account number, and routing number, which Gemini used for ACH fund transfers. The crypto exchange says that no other information, such as date of birth, physical address, social security number, email address, phone number, username, or password, was hosted on the service provider's systems, and were not compromised. The data breach incident is now contained, and an investigation aided by external experts is underway. However, no other information has been made available at this point. The notifications' recipients are advised to remain vigilant about incoming communications and look for signs of fraud that uses part of the exposed information. Moreover, people are told to enable multi-factor authentication on the bank accounts they provided to Gemini to prevent potential hacks, and contact their bank to ask for the activation of additional protection measures or a new account number. If suspicious or unauthorized activity is detected on the impacted bank account, it should be reported to the banks immediately. Gemini also recommends that letter recipients consider placing fraud alerts or security freezes on their credit reports but has not offered the impacted individuals any identity theft protection services. Gemini shared a statement after publishing saying that 15,000 people were impacted by the incident ""The incident at a third party involved information of approximately 15K Gemini customers,"" Gemini told BleepingComputer ""Although we notified the customers involved out of an abundance of caution, our analysis found no evidence of customer impact.""

FinWise data breach shows why encryption is your last defense,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/finwise-data-breach-shows-why-encryption-is-your-last-defense/#comment_form,Home,"October 22, 2025","The 2024 FinWise data breach serves as a stark example of the growing insider threats faced by modern financial institutions. Unlike typical cyberattacks originating from external hackers, this incident stemmed from unauthorized access by a former employee using retained credentials. On May 31, 2024, the ex-employee accessed FinWise Bank’s systems after leaving the company and leaked sensitive personal information belonging to 689,000 customers of American First Finance (AFF). Even more alarming, this unauthorized access went undetected for more than a year before being discovered by the bank on June 18, 2025. The most troubling aspect of the case lies in the time gap between the initial breach and its discovery. FinWise Bank only became aware of the incident and notified affected customers in June 2025 which was over a year after the breach occurred. Lawsuits allege that the stolen data may not have been adequately encrypted and secured, causing public criticism and concern. Security experts emphasize that a well-designed information protection framework must not only encrypt critical financial data but also proactively detect and prevent abnormal access attempts. FinWise Bank’s failure to implement such basic safeguards, coupled with potentially poor encryption practices, has led the institution to face legal action and heightened scrutiny from regulators and customers alike. Although FinWise has yet to issue an official statement regarding its encryption practices, the data breach will result in irreversible damage to both the company and its customers. In incidents like the FinWise breach, encryption serves as the last line of defense for data. However, true data protection goes beyond encryption alone; it also requires key management and access control measures. If FinWise properly implemented and managed its data encryption systems, the exposure of customers’ personal information could have been prevented even after the breach. Moreover, effective key management could have lowered the risk of data misuse, safeguarding sensitive information from further exploitation. Prevent data misuse after cyber attacks. D.AMO combines encryption, key management, and centeralized control to protect your organization’s most sensitive data. In response to data breaches like the one at FinWise, Penta Security’s D.AMO (Encryption Platform) has drawn renewed attention as an effective countermeasure. More than just a data encryption tool, D.AMO is a comprehensive data security platform that integrates powerful encryption, granular access control, and an independent key management system (KMS). Launched in 2004 as South Korea’s first packaged encryption solution and a pioneering product among global leaders, D.AMO has since established itself as a trusted name in the industry. With over 10,000 clients across finance, public, and enterprise sectors, D.AMO’s long-standing experience and proven technology have solidified its position as a leading force in the database encryption market. D.AMO has established itself as the No. 1 data encryption solution in South Korea’s public sector, recognized for its robust cybersecurity infrastructure and specialized expertise. Trusted by government institutions and major enterprises alike, it leads the market with unmatched reliability and technological depth. The platform supports multiple encryption methods, including API-based, plug-in-based, and kernel-level encryption, ensuring flexible deployment across both new implementations and live service environments. Going further, D.AMO enables selective column-level encryption based on data sensitivity, minimizing performance degradation while maintaining full compatibility across all layers of a customer’s system environment. In high-traffic sectors such as finance and government, service continuity is critical. D.AMO ensures that search and operational functions remain intact even after encryption, allowing organizations to achieve both operational efficiency and strong data protection. This balance of performance and security has made us the preferred choice for countless public institutions and large-scale enterprises. While encryption itself can prevent the misuse of sensitive information in the event of a data breach, effective key management is equally critical. The strength of any data encryption strategy is directly proportional to the security of its key management system. D.AMO KMS is a dedicated hardware appliance designed to securely manage encryption keys independently from the data they protect. By separating the privileges of database administrators and security administrators, D.AMO KMS ensures that even those with access to encrypted data cannot access the corresponding keys. This separation of duties serves as one of the most effective defenses against insider threats, such as the FinWise data breach. Furthermore, because D.AMO KMS stores keys in a physically and logically isolated appliance, encrypted data remains protected even if a hacker or insider were to gain full access to the database. Without the decryption keys, the stolen data remains unusable—providing a powerful safeguard against both internal and external breaches. D.AMO Control Center enables centralized management and access control for all encryption products deployed across every layer of a customer’s internal server infrastructure. Through this unified management system, administrators can monitor logs generated by each product and efficiently operate encryption solutions within a single, integrated interface. Incidents like the FinWise data breach underscore the critical importance of user access privileges in preventing insider threats. D.AMO Control Center addresses this challenge by providing granular privilege management, including user account separation, encryption/decryption permission settings, and data access control. By enforcing strict role-based access policies, organizations can proactively defend against potential insider misuse and strengthen overall data security governance. The FinWise data breach was not merely a technical incident, but a systemic failure rooted in inadequate security governance and potentially insufficient encryption and centralized management. This case highlights the growing need for financial institutions to adopt robust defense strategies—not only against external attacks, but also against unpredictable insider threats. Penta Security’s D.AMO provides a comprehensive solution to these challenges. Designed to meet global compliance standards such as PCI-DSS, GDPR, ITSCC, CCPA, and CPRA, D.AMO integrates data encryption (D.AMO), a dedicated key management system (D.AMO KMS), and centralized management (D.AMO Control Center) into a single, unified platform. Through its advanced audit and logging features, D.AMO detects potential data theft resulting from privilege abuse, and even in cases of internal access, its robust encryption and strict key management render the exposed data useless. An analysis of the FinWise breach shows that D.AMO directly addresses every vulnerability revealed in the incident. Organizations must shift their approach to data security from reactive response to proactive prevention. For any institution handling sensitive information, adopting an integrated encryption platform like D.AMO is no longer optional. Data encryption is a critical investment in the future of secure data management. > Download D.AMO White Paper to Learn More . Sponsored and written by Penta Security .",0.5044212341308594

Data consisting of 15 million user records is now being offered for sale on the dark web. This breach is part of a spree of leaks from a group of hackers that is now selling over 73 million user records from 11 companies. The service provides an easy way to create photo books using Instagram and Facebook social media accounts as the source. A hacker group called Shiny Hunters on May 3 started advertising ChatBooks user records on a dark web market, asking $2,000 for 15 million rows of data. They provided a sample with email addresses, hashed passwords (SHA-512), social media access tokens, and personally identifiable information. Users sharing the security breach notification received the bad news on Friday, May 8, saying that the hackers stole login credentials to the service, names, email addresses, and passwords (salted and hashed). “Additionally, for a small portion of the affected records, some phone numbers, FacebookIDs, and inactive social media access and merchant tokens were also stolen” - Nate Quigley, ChatBooks co-founder and CEO The company informed that payment or credit card information was not present in their database, so it was not impacted. Also, there is no evidence to suggest that personal data, like photos, was stolen. According to the notification, the company learned about the intrusion on Tuesday, May 5, two days after the hackers started advertising ChatBooks user records on a dark web market. Based on forensic investigation, the breach occurred on March 26. ChatBooks are not the only victims od Shiny Hunters but it is the first company that admitted to being hacked and alerted their customers. BleepingComputer found that the same hackers are selling user records from multiple companies. Some of them learned from the media that their user records were on sale and had just begun an investigation when BleepingComputer reached out for comment. At this moment, the price for the ChatBooks database is higher, at $3,500. The hackers do not offer the information exclusively, and the details included may have attracted an increased number of buyers. The stolen passwords enjoy some security but the company advises its customers to change their them as soon as possible. Although hashing is a one-way process that does not allow reversing to the original string, hackers have huge lists of passwords. They can convert them to hashes, add the salt, and compare the results with what the stolen database provides. Any match is a cracked password.

"First GDPR Sanction in Germany Fines Flirty Chat Platform EUR 20,000",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/first-gdpr-sanction-in-germany-fines-flirty-chat-platform-eur-20-000/#comment_form,Ionut Ilascu,"November 23, 2018","Following a hack that resulted in leaking about 808,000 email addresses and over 1.8 million usernames and passwords, a social network website in Germany received a fine of EUR 20,000 from the Baden-Württemberg Data Protection Authority. In July this year, flirty chat platform Knuddels.de suffered a data breach and the information stolen from its servers was published online in clear form. A member of the staff said at the time that the incident affected all users that had an account with the service or a username for the chat platform on July 20, 2018. According to a post from another team member, 330,000 of the leaked email addresses were verified, and once Knuddels learned of the leaks (one on Pastebin, another on Mega cloud storage service), it improved security measures, alerted the users and reset their passwords. It was later discovered that the website did not apply any form of protection for sensitive information such as passwords and stored them in plain text. If you think that we made a type about the penalty to be paid and it is missing zero, it is not. To remove all confusion, converted to other currencies, the fine incurred by Knuddels.de is $23,000, or around £18,000. This is the first penalty in Germany under the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which entered into force in May this year. Depending on the level of the infringement, the GDPR provides for fines of up to EUR 20 million or ""4% of the annual revenue of the prior fiscal year, whichever is higher."" In calculating the penalty it is also considered the number of the people impacted, the nature of the infringement, mitigation actions, preventative measures, cooperation with the supervisory authority, transgression record, and notification of data protection enforcer. It appears that Knuddels.de checked almost all the boxes for a more lenient penalty, but failed to comply with data security norms specified by Article 32, letter a) of the GDPR regarding pseudonymization and encryption of users personal data. The German Data Protection Authority says that Knuddels.de proved exemplary transparency, cooperation and was quick to implement security upgrades. Stefan Brink, the State Commissioner for the Baden-Württemberg Data Protection and Freedom of Information (LfDI), says that the organization he runs is not interested in entering a competition for the highest possible fines because the end goal is to improve privacy and data security for the users. Knuddels may seem to have gotten away with a slap on the wrist, but they did have to act fast to mitigate the security faults and ensure minimum impact on its users. These actions occurred over the course of a few weeks, which is no small feat. Furthermore, the company agreed to implement additional security measures in coordination with the LfDI. When you draw the line, Knuddels.de was forced into an unplanned improvement of its security posture, adding to a significant overall financial burden.

LifeLabs Data Breach Exposes Personal Info of 15 Million Customers,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lifelabs-data-breach-exposes-personal-info-of-15-million-customers/,Lawrence Abrams,"December 17, 2019","Canadian clinical laboratory services provider LifeLabs has announced a data breach that exposed the personal information for up to 15 million Canadians after an unauthorized user gained access to their systems. LifeLabs CEO Charles Brown apologized for the data breach that exposed customer information stored on their systems. ""Personally, I want to say I am sorry that this happened. As we manage through this issue, my team and I remain focused on the best interests of our customers. You entrust us with important health information, and we take that responsibility very seriously."" The data breach notification goes on to say that the personal data for up to 15 million customers was accessed by an unauthorized user. This information includes customer names, addresses, emails, logins, passwords, date of birth, and health card numbers. Of these 15 million customers, approximately 85,000 customers had their lab results exposed as well. The exposed data was reportedly from 2016 and earlier and the vast majority of these customers are from B.C. and Ontario After discovering the breach, LifeLabs worked with third-party cybersecurity experts to secure the affected systems and purchase the stolen data from the hackers. It is not known how much they paid for the data. LifeLabs states that they have already notified privacy commissioners and government partners about the breach and in the ""interest of transparency"" are releasing the data breach announcement . For any customer who is concerned about the breach, LifeLabs is offering a free one-year subscription of dark web monitor and identity theft protection. ""Any customer who is concerned about this incident can receive one free year of protection that includes dark web monitoring and identity theft insurance."" BleepingComputer advises all users who are affected by this breach to take them up on their offer of free dark web monitoring subscription as it is very common for attackers to sell stolen information on underground hacker forums. Furthermore, if you use the same password for your LifeLabs account at other sites, it is strongly advised that you change your passwords at those sites. Everyone should also only use unique passwords when registering at other sites so that a data breach at one site does not affect you at another. BleepingComputer has reached out to LifeLabs for more information, but have not heard back as of yet. It's budget season!

Ascension: Health data of 5.6 million stolen in ransomware attack,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ascension-health-data-of-56-million-stolen-in-ransomware-attack/,Sergiu Gatlan,"December 20, 2024","​Ascension, one of the largest private U.S. healthcare systems, is notifying nearly 5.6 million patients and employees that their personal and health data was stolen in a May cyberattack linked to the Black Basta ransomware operation. The health network reported a total revenue of $28.3 billion in 2023 and operates 140 hospitals and 40 senior care facilities across the United States. The company now mails data breach notifications to 5,599,699 affected individuals via the United States Postal Service. Starting Thursday, December 19, Ascension also offers affected people 24 free months of IDX identity theft protection services, including CyberScan monitoring and a $1,000,000 insurance reimbursement policy. Ascension says it notified law enforcement and government partners, such as CISA and the FBI, of the breach after detecting the May 8 attack. ""Upon discovering the unauthorized activity, we initiated an investigation with the assistance of leading cybersecurity experts,"" Ascension states in the breach notification letters . ""Through this investigation, we found evidence that on May 7 and 8, a cybercriminal obtained a copy of certain files containing personal information of our patients and associates."" Since the breach, Ascension's investigation has revealed that some of the stolen files contained patients' and employees' names and information across one or more of the following categories (the specific type of exposed information varies from one individual to another): After the incident, Ascension revealed that the ransomware breach was caused by an employee who downloaded a malicious file onto a company device. However, it believes this was likely an ""honest mistake,"" given that the employee thought they were downloading a legitimate file. The ransomware attack impacted Ascension's MyChart electronic health records system, phones, and systems for ordering tests, procedures, and medications. It also forced the healthcare giant to take some devices offline on May 8 to contain what it initially described as a ""cyber security event."" Following the incident, Ascension employees had to keep track of procedures and medications on paper, as they could no longer access patients' electronic records. The company also had to pause some non-emergent elective procedures, tests, and appointments and divert emergency medical services to other healthcare units to prevent triage delays. While the healthcare giant has yet to link the May attack to a ransomware operation, CNN linked the Black Basta cybercrime gang to the incident (the ransomware group has yet to add Ascension to its data leak site). Days after the breach, the Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center (Health-ISAC) also warned that Black Basta ""has recently accelerated attacks against the healthcare sector."" Since the operation emerged in April 2022, Black Basta has breached the networks of many high-profile victims, including German defense contractor Rheinmetall , outsourcing giant Capita , U.S. government contractor ABB , and the Toronto Public Library . Joint research from Elliptic and Corvus Insurance shows that the ransomware gang collected over $100 million from more than 90 victims until November 2023.

"OpenSea discloses data breach, warns users of phishing attacks",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/opensea-discloses-data-breach-warns-users-of-phishing-attacks/,Sergiu Gatlan,"June 30, 2022","OpenSea, the largest non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace, disclosed a data breach on Wednesday and warned users of phishing attacks that could target them in the coming days. The online NFT marketplace says it has more than 600,000 users and a transaction volume that surpassed $20 billion. The company's Head Of Security, Cory Hardman, said that an employee of Customer.io, the platform's email delivery vendor, downloaded email addresses belonging to OpenSea users and newsletter subscribers. Since the email addresses stolen in the incident were also shared with an unauthorized external party, Hardman urged potentially affected users to be alert for phishing attempts impersonating OpenSea. ""If you have shared your email with OpenSea in the past, you should assume you were impacted. We are working with Customer.io in their ongoing investigation, and we have reported this incident to law enforcement,"" Hardman said . ""Because the data compromise included email addresses, there may be a heightened likelihood for email phishing attempts."" Users were also told to look for emails sent from domains that malicious actors could use to spoof OpenSea's official email domain opensea.io. Examples of domains that could be utilized in phishing attacks targeting OpenSea users include opensea.org, opensea.xyz, and opeansae.io. Hardman also shared a set of safety recommendations that would help defend against phishing attempts advising them to be suspicious of any emails trying to impersonate OpenSea, not to download and open email attachments, and to check the URLs of pages linked in OpenSea emails. Users are also urged never to share or confirm their passwords or secret wallet phrases and never to sign wallet transactions if prompted directly via email. ""We wanted to share the information we have at this time, and let you know that we've reported the incident to law enforcement and are cooperating in their investigation,"" Hardman added. In the past, OpenSea users have been targeted by threat actors impersonating fake support staff and by a phishing attack that left more than a dozen users without hundreds of NFTs worth roughly $2 million. In September, OpenSea also closed a bug that could let attackers empty OpenSea account owners' cryptocurrency wallets by luring them to click on malicious NFT art. An OpenSea spokesperson replied to BleepingComputer's request for more details but provided the same information Hardman shared in today's disclosure.

""Our investigation found that the intrusion originated with an account belonging to a third-party service provider that provided support services to Grubhub,"" the company said on Monday. ""We immediately terminated the account’s access and removed the service provider from our systems altogether."" In response to this incident, the company hired external forensic experts to assess the breach's impact, rotated passwords to prevent further unauthorized access, and added additional anomaly detection mechanisms across its internal services. The follow-up investigation found no evidence that the attackers accessed other sensitive personal and financial information, including Grubhub Marketplace customer passwords, merchant login information, full payment card numbers, bank account details, Social Security numbers, or driver's license numbers. However, GrubHub said that, depending on the affected individual, the attackers gained access to names, email addresses, and phone numbers, as well as partial payment card information (including card type and last four digits of the card number) for some campus diners. ""The unauthorized individual accessed contact information of campus diners, as well as diners, merchants and drivers who interacted with our customer care service,"" GrubHub said. ""The unauthorized party also accessed hashed passwords for certain legacy systems, and we proactively rotated any passwords that we believed might have been at risk. While the attackers didn't access Grubhub Marketplace account passwords, the company urged customers to always use unique passwords to minimize risks. A Grubhub spokesperson was not immediately available for comment when contacted by BleepingComputer earlier today. Grubhub is a food-ordering and delivery platform with over 375,000 merchants and 200,000 delivery partners in more than 4,000 cities nationwide. In December, it agreed to pay $25 million to settle FTC charges and stop engaging in unlawful practices , including not telling consumers the full delivery cost, deceiving drivers about how much money they'd earn, and listing restaurants on its platform without their consent.

Hacker is selling 34 million user records stolen from 17 companies,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacker-is-selling-34-million-user-records-stolen-from-17-companies/#comment_form,Lawrence Abrams,"October 31, 2020","A threat actor is selling account databases containing an aggregate total of 34 million user records that they claim were stolen from seventeen companies during data breaches. On October 28th, a data breach broker created a new topic on a hacker forum to sell the stolen user databases for seventeen companies. In a conversation with BleepingComputer, the seller told us that they were not responsible for hacking into the seventeen companies and is acting as a broker for the databases. When asked how the hacker gained access to the various sites, the seller stated, ""Not sure if he want to disclose."" Stolen databases are typically sold first in private sales, like those listed above, with previous ranging from $500, as seen in the Zoosk data breach, to $100,000 for the Wattpad database . After some time, it is common for the stolen databases to be released for free on hacker forums to increase a threat actor's 'street cred.' According to the data breach broke, all of the seventeen databases being sold were obtained in 2020, with the largest breach being Geekie.com.br with 8.1 million records. The most well-known affected company is Singapore's RedMart that exposed 1.1 million rec The seller told BleepingComputer that they are selling the RedMart database for $1,500. None of these companies have previously reported recent data breaches prior to this week. After BleepingComputer contacted all affected companies, only RedMart disclosed a data breach yesterday, and Wongnai.com told BleepingComputer that they are investigating the incident. ""Thanks for your inquiry, we were aware of this incident last night (Bangkok time) and our tech team have been investigating this matter,"" Wongnai emailed BleepingComputer.com. The seventeen databases being sold are shown below: According to the seller, the following information is exposed per breach: From the samples of each database seen by BleepingComputer, we have confirmed that exposed email addresses correspond to accounts for thirteen of the allegedly seventeen breached services. We could not verify accounts for Clip.mx, Katapult, CouponTools, or Aps-builder.com. The combined databases expose over 34 million user records. While a password is not included in every record, for example, Clip.mx, there is still useful information disclosed in each database that threat actors can use. BleepingComputer has contacted each of the companies being sold online and has only heard from Wongnai at this time. Unfortunately, this lack of response is common when reporting data breaches, and a few weeks later, if not months later, the companies will eventually disclose the breach. To be safe, if you are a user of one of these sites, you should assume that they have been breached and immediately change your password. If you use the same password at other sites, you should also change the password at those sites to a unique and strong one that you only use for that site. Using unique passwords at every site you have an account prevents a data breach at one site from affecting you at other websites you use. It is suggested that you use a password manager to help you keep track of unique and robust passwords at every site.

"ShinyHunters claims Santander breach, selling data for 30M customers",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/shinyhunters-claims-santander-breach-selling-data-for-30m-customers/,Lawrence Abrams,"May 31, 2024","A threat actor known as ShinyHunters is claiming to be selling a massive trove of Santander Bank data, including information for 30 million customers, employees, and bank account data, two weeks after the bank reported a data breach. ShinyHunters is known for selling and leaking data from numerous companies over the years, including this week's alleged massive Ticketmaster data breach impacting 560 million people. They're also the owner of BreachForums, a notorious online community trafficking in the sale and leaking of stolen data which has survived several law enforcement takedowns over the past couple of years Two weeks ago, Spain's largest bank, Santander, disclosed a data breach after detecting unauthorized access to a database hosted by a third-party provider. The company's investigation determined that the threat actor accessed data for employees and customers in Chile, Spain, and Uruguay. ""Following an investigation, we have now confirmed that certain information relating to customers of Santander Chile, Spain and Uruguay, as well as all current and some former Santander employees of the group had been accessed,"" reads a statement from Santander . ""Customer data in all other Santander markets and businesses are not affected."" Fast forward two weeks, and as first spotted by Dark Web Informer , ShinyHunters is now claiming to sell the data for Santander customers in Chile, Spain, and Uruguay for $2 million, the same data the bank reported was stolen. ShinyHunters claims that the stolen data contains the personal information of 30 million customers and employees, 28 million credit card numbers, and 6 million account numbers and balances. As part of the sale listing, the threat actor also shared samples of the data that contains the listed information but cannot be confirmed to belong to Santander. It should be noted that Santander's Q1 2024 financial report states that there are only 19.5 million customers in those countries, rather than tht 30 million claimed by the threat actor. This sales listing comes soon after the FBI seized BreachForums on May 15th, which was operated by ShinyHunters and another threat actor known as Baphomet. While ShinyHunters says that Baphomet was arrested, he quickly restored the BreachForums site from a backup to a new domain. Since then, the threat actor posted the sale of Ticketmaster and Santander, which some feel was done to restore the reputation of the site after its takedown by law enforcement. However, what makes these sales unusual is that both were first listed on the Russian-speaking Exploit hacking forum days before they were listed on the newly-restored BreachForums. These sales were listed under the accounts of new members, with no reference to BreachForums or ShinyHunters, making others believe the sale on BreachForums is a fake. However, ShinyHunters has commonly acted as a data breach broker for other threat actors in the past, and it is not uncommon for these threat actors to create new aliases on various forums to sell stolen data. While TicketMaster has not confirmed whether a data breach occurred, ShinyHunters has a reputation for selling valid data breaches in the past. In 2021, Shiny Hunters claimed to be selling the stolen data of 73 million AT&T customers, which the company repeatedly denied to BleepingComputer. ""I don't care if they don't admit. I'm just selling,"" ShinyHunters told BleepingComputer at the time. In 2024, after the AT&T data was leaked on a hacking forum, AT&T finally confirmed that the data was legitimate and that they had suffered a breach. In the past, ShinyHunters has breached or leaked the data for numerous companies, including Wattpad , Tokopedia , Microsoft's GitHub account , BigBasket , Nitro PDF , Pixlr , TeeSpring , Promo.com , Mathway , and many more .

Massive Allianz Life data breach impacts 1.1 million people,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/massive-allianz-life-data-breach-impacts-11-million-people/#comment_form,Sergiu Gatlan,"August 19, 2025","Hackers have stolen the personal information of 1.1 million individuals in a Salesforce data theft attack, which impacted U.S. insurance giant Allianz Life in July. Allianz Life has nearly 2,000 employees in the United States and is a subsidiary of Allianz SE, which has over 128 million customers worldwide and ranks as the world's 82nd largest company based on revenue. As the company disclosed last month , information belonging to the ""majority"" of its 1.4 million customers was stolen by attackers who gained access to a third-party cloud CRM system on July 16th. While Allianz Life did not name the provider of the compromised cloud-based CRM system at the time of the disclosure, BleepingComputer first reported that the breach was part of a wave of Salesforce-targeted data theft attacks linked to the ShinyHunters extortion group. Since the attack, ShinyHunters has leaked the databases stolen from the company's Salesforce instances, containing roughly 2.8 million data records for individual customers and business partners, including wealth management companies, financial advisors, and brokers. On Monday, data breach notification service Have I Been Pwned revealed the extent of the incident, reporting that the email addresses, names, genders, dates of birth, phone numbers, and physical addresses of 1.1 million Allianz Life customers were stolen during the breach. BleepingComputer has also confirmed with multiple people affected by this breach that their data (including their tax IDs, phone numbers, email addresses, and other information) in the leaked files is accurate. Many other high-profile companies worldwide were also breached in this campaign, including Google , Adidas , Qantas , Louis Vuitton , Dior , Tiffany & Co. , Chanel , and, most recently, human resources giant Workday . The attacks are believed to have begun at the start of the year, with the threat actors tricking employees into linking a malicious OAuth app to their company's Salesforce instance. Once connected, the attackers downloaded and stole company databases, later using the data to extort victims via email. These extortion demands were signed as coming from ShinyHunters, a well-known extortion group linked to a string of high-profile breaches over the years, including the Snowflake attacks and those against AT&T and PowerSchool . When contacted by BleepingComputer to confirm Have I Been Pwned's findings, an Allianz Life spokesperson couldn't ""offer any additional comment at this time"" because of an ongoing investigation. However, the spokesperson confirmed that ""some selected Allianz Life employees"" were also impacted by the breach. Update August 19, 08:47 EDT: Added Allianz Life statement. It's budget season!

Founded in 1984 in Barcelona, MANGO is a clothing and fashion accessories designer and manufacturer, operating physical and e-commerce stores in 2,800 locations across 120 countries. The company employs 16,300 people and has an annual revenue of €3.3 billion, of which approximately 30% comes from online purchases. On October 14, 2025, the company sent data breach notifications to its customers, informing them that personal data used in marketing campaigns had been compromised. ""MANGO wishes to inform you that one of the external marketing services has suffered unauthorized access to certain customers' personal data,"" reads the notice . The types of data exposed in this incident include a customer's first name, country, postal code, email address, and telephone number. MANGO specified that last names, banking information, credit card data, IDs, passports, or account credentials were not compromised in this incident. Although the absence of last names in the exposed data set lessens the risk, attackers can still use the remaining compromised data in phishing attacks. The company also noted that its corporate infrastructure and IT systems remain unaffected, and so business operations weren't impacted. ""We inform you that everything continues to function normally and that Mango's corporate infrastructure and systems have not been compromised,"" stated the company . All security protocols in place were activated upon learning of the data breach at the marketing service provider, which has not been named. The company also stated that the Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD) and relevant authorities have been notified about the breach. A dedicated email address (personaldata@mango.com) and telephone hotline (900 150 543) have been established to support customers concerned about the potential exposure from this incident. BleepingComputer has contacted MANGO to learn more about the cyberattack and its scope of impact, but we have not received a response at the time of publication.

Hundreds of Hotels Affected by Data Breach at Hotel Booking Software Provider,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hundreds-of-hotels-affected-by-data-breach-at-hotel-booking-software-provider/,Catalin Cimpanu,"June 26, 2018","The personal details and payment card data of guests from hundreds of hotels, if not more, have been stolen this month by an unknown attacker, Bleeping Computer has learned. The data was taken from FastBooking, a Paris-based company that sells hotel booking software to more than 4,000 hotels in 100 countries —as it claims on its website. In emails the company sent out to affected hotels today, FastBooking revealed the breach took place on June 14, when an attacker used a vulnerability in an application hosted on its server to install a malicious tool (malware). This tool allowed the intruder remote access to the server, which he used to exfiltrate data. The incident came to light when FastBooking employees discovered this malicious tool on its server. According to FastBooking, the intruder stole information such as a hotel guests' first and last names, nationality, postal addresses, email addresses, and hotel booking-related information (hotel name, check-in, and check-out details). In some cases, but not all, the intruder also obtained payment card details were also stolen, such as the name printed on the payment card, the card's number, and its expiration date. Not all of FastBooking's customers were impacted the same. The attacker stole just guest details from some hotels, payment card details from others, or both in other cases. The French company has sent emails to each affected hotel with details about the number of affected guests for each entity, and what type of data the attacker stole. Bleeping Computer has learned that FastBooking is also providing templates that each hotel can use to notify former guests of the breach, and templates to notify national data protection agencies about the leak of private guest data and their respective payment card details. In a press release aimed at the Japanese market, FastBooking said the incident affected 380 Japanese hotels alone. It is reasonable to believe the number of impacted hotels across the world is larger than the Japanese tally, possibly going above 1,000. Bleeping Computer has contacted FastBooking with questions about the total number of impacted hotels, the number of guests who had their private details stolen, and the number of guests who had payment card details taken from FastBooking's server. The company said it would provide a statement about the incident, but we did not receive one before this article's deadline. Our reporting will be updated when FastBooking answers our questions. The FastBooking incident is eerily similar to the PageUp breach that took place at the start of the month. Just like in the FastBooking incident, hackers breached PageUp's servers and used a malicious tool (malware) to steal information from PageUp's customers. PageUp is a provider of human resources management software for the world's largest companies, and the attacker stole the personal data of job applications at companies all over the world. That incident triggered a wave of data breach notifications from all the affected companies, and a similar wave is about to start this time as well. The first hotel chain to inform customers of the FastBooking breach is Prince Hotels & Resorts in Japan. The hotel chain said the incident affected 124,963 guests who stayed at 82 of its hotels.

TalkTalk investigates breach after data for sale on hacking forum,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/talktalk-investigates-breach-after-data-for-sale-on-hacking-forum/#comment_form,Lawrence Abrams,"January 25, 2025","Update: Added supplier statement at the end of the article. UK telecommunications company TalkTalk is investigating a third-party supplier data breach after a threat actor began selling alleged customer data on a hacking forum. ""As part of our regular security monitoring, given our ongoing focus on protecting customers' personal data, we were made aware of unexpected access to, and misuse of, one of our third-party supplier's systems, however, no billing or financial information was stored on this system,"" TalkTalk told BleepingComputer. ""Our Security Incident Response team are continuing to work with the supplier regarding this matter and protective containment steps were taken immediately."" ""Our investigations are ongoing, however we can confirm that the number of potential customers referred to in certain online posts is wholly inaccurate and very significantly overstated."" This statement comes after someone named ""b0nd"" began selling what they claim is TalkTalk customer data on a hacking forum that was allegedly stolen in a January 2025 data breach. ""As the title says today we will list for sale a large data breach involving TalkTalk. This breach took place January 2025 and affects 18,839,551 current and previous customers."" reads the post to a hacking forum. The threat actor also shared a sample of the data, which includes the subscriber's name, email, last-used IP address, business phone number, and home phone number. While the forum post says the stolen data contains information about almost 18.9 million current and previous TalkTalk customers, the company does not have nearly that number of subscribers, putting the authenticity of the breach in doubt. Furthermore, the screenshots shared by the threat actor indicate that the data was possibly stolen from the Ascendon SaaS platform rather than directly from TalkTalk. CSG Ascendon is a subscription management platform that TalkTalk has historically used as part of its operations. In 2015, TalkTalk suffered a data breach where hackers accessed the personal details of over 150,000 customers. The incident led to a £400,000 fine by the UK Information Commissioner's Office.

Australia will now fine firms up to AU$50 million for data breaches,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/australia-will-now-fine-firms-up-to-au50-million-for-data-breaches/,Bill Toulas,"November 30, 2022","The Australian parliament has approved a bill to amend the country's privacy legislation, significantly increasing the maximum penalties to AU$50 million for companies and data controllers who suffered large-scale data breaches. The financial penalty introduced by the new bill is set to whichever is greater: Previously, the penalty for severe data exposures was AU$2.22 million, considered wholly inadequate to incentivize companies to improve their data security mechanisms. The new bill comes in response to a series of recent cyberattacks against Australian companies, including ransomware and network breaches, resulting in the exposure of highly sensitive data for millions of people in the country. ""The Albanese Labor government has wasted no time in responding to recent major data breaches. We have announced, introduced, and delivered legislation in just over a month,"" reads the media announcement . ""These new, larger penalties send a clear message to large companies that they must do better to protect the data they collect."" The most notable incidents were the Optus telecommunication provider data breach that impacted 11 million people and the Medibank insurance firm ransomware attack that exposed the data of 9.7 million . ""Significant privacy breaches in recent months have shown existing safeguards are outdated and inadequate. These reforms make clear to companies that the penalty for a major data breach can no longer be regarded as the cost of doing business."" - Australian Government. Apart from setting higher fines, the new bill also gives greater powers to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) to get more involved in the privacy breach resolution and scope determination process. OAIC has welcomed the passing of the amendment and promised Australians that it would use its enhanced role to protect individuals and the country's economy better. ""The updated penalties will bring Australian privacy law into closer alignment with competition and consumer remedies and international penalties under Europe's General Data Protection Regulation,"" stated Commissioner Angelene Falk. ""In seeking penalties or taking regulatory action, our approach will continue to be pragmatic, evidence-based, and proportionate."" For comparison, Europe's GDPR sets fines of up to 10 million Euros or (whichever is higher) up to 2% of the global turnover of the preceding fiscal year.

An email sent out to affected customers by DigitalOcean states that a ""flaw"" allowed an unauthorized user to access customers' billing details between April 9th, 2021, and April 22nd, 2021. ""An unauthorized user gained access to some of your billing account details through a flaw that has been fixed. This exposure impacted a small percentage of our customers,"" reads the email sent to customers. The email states that the exposed information includes a customer's billing name, billing address, payment card expiration, last four digits of credit card, and the payment card's bank name. DigitalOcean states that they have fixed the flaw and disclosed the breach to data protection authorities. It is not clear what agencies were notified. Tyler Healy, VP Security at DigitalOcean, told TechCrunch that this flaw exposed only 1% of billing profiles. BleepingComputer has reached out to DigitalOcean with further questions but has not heard back at this time.

Google disputes false claims of massive Gmail data breach,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-disputes-false-claims-of-massive-gmail-data-breach/,Lawrence Abrams,"October 27, 2025","Google was once again forced to announce that it had not suffered a data breach after numerous news outlets published sensational stories about a fake breach that purportedly exposed 183 million accounts. This claim began over the weekend and into today, with news stories claiming that millions of Gmail accounts were breached, with some outlets saying it affected the full 183 million accounts. However, as the company explained in a series of posts on Monday, Gmail did not suffer a breach, and the compromised accounts were actually from a compilation of credentials stolen by information-stealing malware and other attacks over the years. ""Reports of a 'Gmail security breach impacting millions of users' are false. Gmail's defenses are strong, and users remain protected,"" reads a post on X . ""The inaccurate reports are stemming from a misunderstanding of infostealer databases, which routinely compile various credential theft activity occurring across the web. It's not reflective of a new attack aimed at any one person, tool, or platform."" ""Several inaccurate claims surfaced recently that incorrectly stated that we issued a broad warning to all Gmail users about a major Gmail security issue. This is entirely false,"" Google added. This is just the latest such story that numerous news websites and cybersecurity companies have reported without verification in recent years. This particular story stems from Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) creator Troy Hunt announcing he recently added a massive collection of 183 million compromised credentials to the data breach notification platform shared by the threat intelligence platform Synthient. These credentials were not stolen in a single data breach, but rather through information-stealing malware, data breaches, credential stuffing, and phishing. Furthermore, these accounts are not for a single platform but for thousands, if not millions, of sites. Threat actors commonly collect exposed credentials and combine them into massive collections, which are then shared among the cybercrime community on Telegram channels, Discord servers, and hacking forums. After loading the data into HIBP, Hunt says 91% of the 183 million credentials had previously been seen, illustrating that many of them have been circulating for years. ""The final number once the entire data set was loaded into HIBP was 91% pre-existing, with 16.4M previously unseen addresses in any data breach, not just stealer logs,"" explained Hunt. Companies, including Google, commonly use collections like these to warn customers of exposed passwords and to force password resets to protect accounts. ""Gmail takes action when we spot large batches of open credentials, helping users reset passwords and resecure accounts,"" explained Google. While the claims of a Gmail data breach are false, that does not mean exposed credentials are harmless or should be ignored, as threat actors commonly use them to breach corporate networks and carry out devastating attacks. For example, the UnitedHealth Change Healthcare ransomware attack was caused by exposed Citrix credentials that enabled threat actors to gain initial network access. However, reports of unfounded data breaches do not help anyone and only cause undue stress and extra work for a platform's users and business customers. Just last month, Google had to state that it did not suffer a data breach after the same news sites claimed that 2.5 billion Gmail accounts had been compromised . While that claim stemmed from a Salesloft breach that impacted a small number of Google Workspace accounts , the story was quickly sensationalized into a much larger breach. If you are concerned that your credentials may have been part of the Synthient collection, you can register an account at Have I Been Pwned , open the dashboard, and click Stealer Logs to see if your account was compromised in the past by information-stealing malware. If you have accounts listed, perform an antivirus scan on your computer, then immediately change the passwords for all of your accounts. It's budget season!

Promo.com discloses data breach after 22M user records leaked online,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/promocom-discloses-data-breach-after-22m-user-records-leaked-online/,Lawrence Abrams,"July 27, 2020","Promo.com, an Israeli-based marketing video creation site, has disclosed a data breach after a database containing 22 million user records was leaked for free on a hacker forum. Promo is a web site that allows you to create promotional videos or ads that can then be shared on social networks such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn. In a report shared with BleepingComputer by cybersecurity intelligence firm CloudSEK, a well-known seller of data breaches posted a database containing 22.1 million user records on a hacker forum. This data contains users email addresses, names, genders, geographic location, and for 2.6 million of the users, their hashed passwords. This leak included 1.4 million cracked passwords, which means they were decrypted and could immediately be used by attackers to log in to the users' accounts or use the passwords in credential stuff attacks at other sites. This post was eventually taken down, but this past week another data breach seller released the database again on the same hacker forum. It is not known if this database also contained the cracked passwords. After the public leaking of their database, Promo issued a data breach notification stating they became aware of a vulnerability on a third-party partner's service that affected their data. ""On July 21, 2020, our team became aware that a data security vulnerability on a 3rd party service had caused a breach affecting certain non-finance related Slidely and Promo user data. We immediately stopped all suspicious activity and launched an internal investigation to further learn about what happened,"" Promo's data breach notification states. Promo further stated that no financial information was exposed, but that a users IP address, gender, email address, name, and hashed and salted passwords were disclosed. ""The exposed data includes first name, last name, email address, IP address, approximated user location based on the IP address, gender, as well as encrypted, hashed and salted password to the Promo or Slidely account. Although your account password was hashed and salted (a method used to secure passwords with a key), it’s possible that it was decoded,"" the data breach continues. As the salt for each user's password was also included in the database, it is much easier for threat actors to crack the passwords and see them in their plain text form. Promo also stated that ""Your Log in via your social media account was not affected,"" but one of the databases shared on the hacker forum included social network login tokens. It is unknown if these token can be used to log in to your social network accounts, but it is advised to regenerate the tokens if possible. Promo is performing a mandatory reset on all affected accounts the next time they log into Promo.com. While the passwords leaked in this data breach were encrypted, threat actors have already started to decrypt them, and the rest can be decrypted over time. After a user's password is cracked, threat actors would be able to use them in credential stuffing attacks at other sites. Due to this, if you are a Promo customer, you should immediately change your password to one that is strong and unique. If you use that same password at other sites, it is strongly advised that you change your password to a unique one at those sites as well. A password manager can make it much easier to use unique passwords at every site and is highly recommended. If you are concerned that you were exposed in this breach, Have I Been Pwned has added the database to their site, and you can use it to check if your record was included in the data breach.

The company emailed the data breach notifications late Friday afternoon, warning that customers' data was stored in a Western Digital database stolen during the attack. ""Based on the investigation, we recently learned that, on or around March 26, 2023, an unauthorized party obtained a copy of a Western Digital database that contained limited personal information of our online store customers,"" Western Digital said. ""The information included customer names, billing and shipping addresses, email addresses, and telephone numbers. As a security measure, the relevant database stored, in encrypted format, hashed passwords (which were salted) and partial credit card numbers."" Western Digital has taken its store offline while they continue investigating the incident, with the store now displaying a message stating, ""We'll be back soon: We are unable to process orders at this time."" The company expects to restore access to the store on May 15th, 2023. Western Digital also warns impacted customers to be vigilant against spear-phishing attacks, where threat actors impersonate the company and use the stolen data to gather further personal information from customers. The data breach notification comes after Western Digital suffered a cyberattack on March 26th, when the company discovered its network was hacked and company data was stolen. In response to the attack, the company shut down its cloud services for two weeks , along with mobile, desktop, and web apps. TechCrunch reported that an ""unnamed"" hacking group breached Western Digital, claiming to have stolen ten terabytes of data. While the threat actors claim not to be part of the ALPHV ransomware operation , they used their data leak site to extort Western Digital, linking them in some manner to the extortion gang. In a note published on April 28th, the threat actors taunted Western Digital by releasing screenshots of stolen emails, documents, and applications that showed they still had access to the company's network even after being detected. The hackers also claimed to have stolen an SAP Backoffice database containing customer information and shared a screenshot of what appears to be customers' invoices. Since then, no further data was released by the threat actors, likely indicating that they are still extorting Western Digital in the hopes of receiving a ransom demand. It's budget season!

This announcement refers to a security breach that took place in 2013 and which came to light in December 2016. Three months earlier, in September 2016, Yahoo admitted to another data breach that exposed the details of over 500 million users , which took place in 2014. The US Department of Justice and the FBI indicted four suspects — three Russian nationals and a Canadian — for that breach. No details became public about the 2013 security incident, except the number of affected users and that hackers stole names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords (using MD5) and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers. Verizon was slated to buy Yahoo even before the first data breach announcement (2014 incident), and even agreed to buy the company following the second breach announcement (the 2013 incident), albeit it cut the purchase price from $4.83 billion by $350 million to $4.48 billion. Yahoo said today that it only recently became aware of the scope of the breach, during the integration of Yahoo data inside Verizon's infrastructure. Subsequent to Yahoo's acquisition by Verizon, and during integration, the company recently obtained new intelligence and now believes, following an investigation with the assistance of outside forensic experts, that all Yahoo user accounts were affected by the August 2013 theft. Yahoo already notified all one billion users affected by the 2013 security breach. It promised today to notify the rest.

Other threat actors have already started to crack passwords and share them online. Tokopedia is Indonesia's largest online store, with 4,700 employees and over 90 million active users. This weekend, data breach monitoring and cybersecurity intelligence firm Under the Breach discovered that a hacker was offering the account information for 15 million Tokopedia users on an online hacker forum. To access this data, forum users would need to spend eight site 'credits', which costs approximately €2.13. The hacker claims that this data was a small subset of a more substantial 91 million user dump stolen from Tokopedia during a March 2020 hack. Soon after the smaller subset was released on the hacker forum, the same hacker began selling the full 91 million user database on an online criminal marketplace for as little $5,000. At the time of this writing, the database has been sold two times. From a sample of the leaked data shared with BleepingComputer by Under the Breach, the dump was for a PostgreSQL database that contains many fields for personal user data, but only a small subset actually contain information. The most serious of the exposed data consists of a user's email address, full name, birth date, and hashed user passwords. Some of the exposed accounts also have their mobile device's Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory Number (MSISDN) listed. In a statement, VP of Corporate Communications Tokopedia, Nuraini Razak has told BleepingComputer that they are currently conducting an investigation into do the data leak and are enhancing the security of their systems. ""Tokopedia is working closely with several strategic partners, including the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology RI and National Cyber and Crypto Agency, to conduct a thorough investigation, while enhancing the security system in order to maintain user confidence. We would like to emphasize once again that Tokopedia is a business of trust. Therefore, the security of our users' data is Tokopedia's utmost priority."" Under the Breach has told BleepingComputer that threat actors have already started to share over 200,000 user names and their associated dehashed, or cracked, passwords on hacking forums. These dehashed accounts are being shared for free to use who simply reply to the forum topic or who have upgraded accounts on the forum. Cybersecurity intelligence firm Cyble has also told BleepingCompter that they are aware of threat actors who claim to be selling a list of millions of Tokopedia usernames and their associated dehashed, or cracked, passwords for just $8,000. Cyble believes the database has been privately circulating since April, and now that it is publicly leaked, the threat actor decided to sell their dehashed account list before others release it. BleepingComputer has not been able to independently confirm if these are legitimate dehashed accounts or if the threat actor is trying to pull a money grab scam. Cyble has stated that they acquired the Tokopedia database and users can check if their account has been exposed via Cyble's data breach monitoring platform amibreached.com . All Tokopedia users should make the assumption that if their passwords is not dehashed already, it may be in the future, and should immediately change their password to a unique one only used at that site. For any other site that the same password was used, it should be changed to a unique one there as well. Finally, all users who were exposed by this data breach should be on the lookout for targeted phishing attacks that utilize the information from this data dump.

Workiva, a leading cloud-based SaaS (Software as a Service) provider, notified its customers that attackers who gained access to a third-party customer relationship management (CRM) system stole some of their data. The company's cloud software helps collect, connect, and share data for financial reports, compliance, and audits. It had 6,305 customers at the end of last year and reported revenues of $739 million in 2024. Its customer list includes 85% of the Fortune 500 companies and high-profile clients such as Google, T-Mobile, Delta Air Lines, Wayfair, Hershey, Slack, Cognizant, Santander, Nokia, Kraft Heinz, Wendy's, Paramount, Air France KLM, Mercedes-Benz, and more. According to a private email notification sent to affected Workiva customers last week and seen by BleepingComputer, the threat actors exfiltrated a limited set of business contact information, including names, email addresses, phone numbers, and support ticket content. ""This is similar to recent events that have targeted several large organizations. Importantly, the Workiva platform and any data within it were not accessed or compromised,"" the company explained. ""Our CRM vendor notified us of unauthorized access via a connected third-party application."" Workiva also warned impacted customers to remain vigilant, as the stolen information could be used in spear-phishing attacks. ""Workiva will never contact anyone by text or phone to request a password or any other secure details. All communications from Workiva come through our trusted official support channels,"" it said. While Workiva didn't share more details regarding this attack, BleepingComputer has learned that this incident was part of the recent wave of Salesforce data breaches linked to the ShinyHunters extortion group that impacted many high-profile companies. Most recently, Cloudflare disclosed that it was forced to rotate 104 Cloudflare platform-issued tokens stolen by ShinyHunters threat actors, who gained access to the Salesforce instance used for customer support and internal customer case management in mid-August. ShinyHunters has been targeting Salesforce customers in data theft attacks using voice phishing (vishing) since the start of the year , impacting companies such as Google , Cisco , Allianz Life , Farmers Insurance , Workday , Qantas , Adidas , and LVMH subsidiaries, including Dior , Louis Vuitton , and Tiffany & Co. More recently, the extortion group has shifted to using stolen OAuth tokens for Salesloft's Drift AI chat integration with Salesforce to gain access to customer Salesforce instances and extract sensitive information, such as passwords, AWS access keys, and Snowflake tokens, from customer messages and support tickets. Using this method, ShinyHunters also gained access to a small number of Google Workspace accounts in addition to stealing Salesforce CRM data and breaching the Salesforce instances of multiple cybersecurity companies, including Zscaler , Tenable , CyberArk , Elastic , BeyondTrust , Proofpoint , JFrog , Nutanix , Qualys , Rubrik , Cato Networks , and Palo Alto Networks .

"Kroll data breach exposes info of FTX, BlockFi, Genesis creditors",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kroll-data-breach-exposes-info-of-ftx-blockfi-genesis-creditors/#comment_form,Bill Toulas,"August 25, 2023","Multiple reports on social media warn of a data breach at financial and risk advisory company Kroll that resulted in exposing to an unauthorized third-party the personal data of some credit claimants. Kroll, who is facilitating claims for insolvent companies FTX , BlockFi , and Genesis Global Holdco , has confirmed that one of its employees was the victim of a SIM-swapping attack. Hackers stole the Kroll employee's phone number and used it to gain access to some files with personal data of bankruptcy claimants. FTX and BlockFi posted on X today that a security incident at Kroll involving unauthorized third-party access on its systems exposed “limited, non-sensitive customer data of specific claimants.” Although the nature of exposed data are not explicitly mentioned, the two companies clarify that user passwords and client funds haven’t been impacted, as neither FTX’s nor BlockFi’s systems were directly breached. Also, both state that Kroll will notify impacted individuals directly, and the company has already contained and remediated the incident. In a statement today, Kroll says that a threat actor on August 19 targeted a T-Mobile account belonging to a Kroll employee and managed to steal the phone number of a Kroll employee. ""As a result, it appears the threat actor gained access to certain files containing personal information of bankruptcy claimants in the matters of BlockFi, FTX and Genesis. Immediate actions were taken to secure the three affected accounts"" - Kroll Kroll says that it has already notified affected individuals. In the aftermath of the reported breach at Kroll, several people related to the pending bankruptcy cases of the crypto firms posted samples of phishing emails they received on social media. In most of the reported cases, the messages sent to those people impersonate FTX and claim that the recipient is eligible to begin withdrawing digital assets from their accounts, supposedly matching their last known balance on the platform. These messages aim to phish people’s seeds that protect their cryptocurrency wallets, and to empty them. Although Genesis has not published anything about the case, CoinDesk editor Rob Mitchell shared a notice from the firm about the data breach earlier today, where it is mentioned that Kroll’s incident resulted from a SIM swapping attack on one of their employee’s T-Mobile numbers. The attackers bypassed MFA to take over the employer’s account and access files stored in Kroll’s cloud-based systems, including full names, physical addresses, email addresses, and debtor claim details. Kroll handles restructuring cases for hundreds of entities , but a spokesperson of the firm told BleepingComputer that the scope of the impact is limited to the three mentioned crypto-investment companies and their creditors. The security incident only impacted files pertaining to BlockFi, FTX and Genesis There is no evidence that the threat actor moved laterally or gained access to any other Kroll user accounts or systems . - Kroll spokesperson UPDATE [August 25, 11:58 AM]: Article updated with the statement from Kroll.

NetGalley discloses data breach after website was hacked,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/netgalley-discloses-data-breach-after-website-was-hacked/#comment_form,Lawrence Abrams,"December 24, 2020","The NetGalley book promotion site has suffered a data breach that allowed threat actors to access a database with members' personal information. NetGalley is a website that allows authors and publishers to promote digital review copies of their books (galleys) to book advocates, influential readers, and industry professionals in the hopes that they will recommend the books to their audience. On Monday, December 21st, NetGalley's website was hacked and defaced. After further investigations, it was determined that the threat actors also accessed a backup for the site's database containing members' data. ""It is with great regret that we inform you that on Monday, December 21, 2020 NetGalley was the victim of a data security incident. What initially seemed like a simple defacement of our homepage has, with further investigation, resulted in the unauthorized and unlawful access to a backup file of the NetGalley database,"" NetGalley disclosed in a data breach advisory . This backup database included NetGalley members' personal information, including their login name, password, name, and email address. Other optional information that could have been in the database includes users' mailing address, birthday, company name, and Kindle email address. NetGalley states that there was no financial information stored in the database. In response to the breach, NetGalley requires all users to reset their password when they next log in. BleepingComputer has reached out to NetGalley with questions on whether the passwords were hashed in the database but has not heard back. If you are a NetGalley member, you should immediately log in to the site and change your password. If you use the same NetGalley password at other sites, you should also change the password at those sites to a unique and strong one for that site. Using unique passwords at every site you have an account prevents a data breach at one site from affecting you at other websites you use. It is suggested that you use a password manager to help you keep track of unique and robust passwords at every site. It's budget season!

The insurer discovered the data breach after an internal audit according to Jens Wikström, Head of Marketing and Sales at Folksam, and reported the incident to the Swedish Data Protection Authority ( Datainspektionen ). ""The companies that have received personal data from Folksam are, for example, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Linkedin, and Adobe,"" Wikström explained. ""The purpose has been, among other things, to analyze what information logged-in customers and other visitors searched for on folksam.se."" The sensitive personal data shared by Folksam includes various types of info such as social security numbers or that an individual purchased union or pregnancy insurance. Analysis results of the shared data were used by the tech giants to provide customers with custom offers through Folksam's and other companies' communication channels said Wikström. ""Our purpose with this has been to analyze and give our customers customized offers, but unfortunately we have not done it in the right way,"" Wikström added. After discovering the breach, Folksam immediately stopped sharing the sensitive information with its digital partners and requested the information be deleted by the companies which received it. ""We understand that this can cause concern among our customers and we take what has happened seriously,"" Wikström said . ""We immediately stopped sharing this personal information and requested that it be deleted."" Folksam says that there is no evidence at the moment that the shared sensitive data has been used by any third parties improperly.

T-Mobile discloses data breach after SIM swapping attacks,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/t-mobile-discloses-data-breach-after-sim-swapping-attacks/,Sergiu Gatlan,"February 26, 2021","American telecommunications provider T-Mobile has disclosed a data breach after an unknown number of customers were apparently affected by SIM swap attacks. SIM swap fraud (or SIM hijacking) allows scammers to take control of targets' phone numbers after porting them using social engineering or after bribing mobile operator employees to a SIM controlled by the fraudsters. Subsequently, they receive the victims' messages and calls which allows for easily bypassing SMS-based multi-factor authentication (MFA), stealing user credentials, as well taking over the victims' online service accounts. The criminals can then log into the victims' bank accounts to steal money, change account passwords, and even locking the victims out of their own accounts. The FBI shared guidance on how to defend against SIM swapping following an increase in the number of SIM hijacking attacks targeting cryptocurrency adopters and investors. In a data breach notice sent to impacted customers on February 9, 2021, and filed with US attorney generals' offices, T-Mobile revealed that an unknown attacker gained access to customers' account information, including personal info and personal identification numbers (PINs). As the attackers were able to port numbers, it is not clear if they gained access to an employee's account or did it through the compromised users' accounts. A T-Mobile spokesperson was not available for comment when contacted by BleepingComputer earlier today. ""[A]n unknown actor gained access to certain account information. It appears the actor may then have used this information to port your line to a different carrier without your authorization,"" T-Mobile said. ""T-Mobile identified this activity—terminated the unauthorized access, and implemented measures to protect against reoccurrence."" The information accessed by the hackers might have included customers' full names, addresses, email addresses, account numbers, social security numbers (SSNs), account personal identification numbers (PIN), account security questions and answers, date of birth, plan information, and the number of lines subscribed to their accounts. ""T-Mobile quickly identified and terminated the unauthorized activity; however we do recommend that you change your customer account PIN,"" the company also said. Impacted T-Mobile customers are advised to change their account's password, PIN, as well as their security questions and answers. T-Mobile is offering two years of free credit monitoring and identity theft detection services through Transunion's myTrueIdentity. This is the fifth data breach disclosed by T-Mobile during the last four years, all of them being reported after hackers gained access to customers' data. T-Mobile previously suffered from breaches in 2018 when millions of customers' info was accessed by hackers and in 2019 after exposing prepaid customers' data . Last year, the company disclosed two more breaches, one of them in March 2020, when attackers gained access to customer and employee data . In December 2020, T-Mobile's suffered another data breach after unknown threat actors again accessed customers' phone numbers and call records . Update February 27, 02:44 EST: The attackers used an internal T-Mobile application to target up to 400 customers in SIM swap attack attempts, BleepingComputer has learned. No T-Mobile for Business customers were impacted during this incident. BleepingComputer knows of at least one T-Mobile customer impacted by a SIM hijacking attack during the last month.

Adobe Magento Marketplace Exposed User Info in Data Breach,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/adobe-magento-marketplace-exposed-user-info-in-data-breach/,Ionut Ilascu,"November 29, 2019","Magento Marketplace users were informed this week that a vulnerability allowed an unauthorized third party to gain access to some account information. The breach was discovered on November 21 and the service was temporarily shut down to address the security issue. Magento Marketplace is a repository where users can find free and paid extensions and themes for the e-commerce platform. Adobe in May 2018, announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Magento for $1.68 billion. An investigation into the circumstances of the breach revealed that it impacted names, email, MageID, billing and shipping address, and phone numbers. Limited commercial information like percentages for payments to developers was also exposed to the hacker. More sensitive data like passwords or financial information related to payment cards remained unaffected. Magento Marketplace account holders were notified directly, said in a blog post on Wednesday Jason Woosley, Vice President of Commerce Product & Platform, Experience Business, at Adobe. There are no details on the number of accounts affected by the breach or for how long the intruder had access to the data. The Marketplace is currently online and analysis of the incident showed that no Magento core products were affected by the issue. Furthermore, the event did not have any effect on operations. In the notification to users, Magento says that while the problem is fixed, the recommendation for following security best practices to protect stores still stands. Good security hygiene includes keeping Magento instances and extensions up-to-date.

"Discover Card Users Affected by Data Breach, New Credit Cards Issued",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/discover-card-users-affected-by-data-breach-new-credit-cards-issued/,Sergiu Gatlan,"January 28, 2019","A data breach incident impacting Discover cards has potentially provided attackers with access to an undisclosed amount of customer information, although anything from account numbers and expiration dates to security codes might have been stolen. Although these types of data breaches are not uncommon for financial institutions, this is only the second time a data breach involving customers' cards has been reported during 2018 by Discover Financial Services to the California Attorney General. According to California's law, companies who conduct business with California residents are required to file security notices with the Attorney General's office in the event of a data breach or a cybersecurity incident impacting customer data. Moreover, firms have to send and submit a sample of the data breach notice that is sent if more than 500 California residents are affected. Discover Financial Services learned that on August 13, 2018, an undisclosed number of Discover card accounts might have been part of a data breach according to sample notices filed on January 25, 2019, with the California Attorney General's office. However, according to the same notices, ""Please know, this breach did not involve Discover card systems."" Discover provided no information on the number of customers affected This would imply that the card information has either been stolen by attackers from third parties who had the payment details of Discover customers stored on systems that were compromised or that the Discover card data was found up for sale on the black market, possibly stolen using skimmers or data-stealing malware. Although there is no info regarding the number of individuals affected by this data breach, Discover chose to issue new cards for all the customers that might have had their card information swiped in the attack. Discover's breach notification says that ""We are issuing you a new card with a new security code and expiration date to reduce the possibility of fraud on your account. Remember, if your account does experience fraud, you're never responsible for unauthorized purchases on your Discover card."" Furthermore, the two separate sample breach notifications which were filed with the Attorney General's office hint at either two collections of card data being found or at two types of cards being involved in the data breach. The two breach notification are also different when it comes to the ""Automatic Bills"" section, with one saying that ""there's no need to contact the merchants we've listed below"" while also stating that the ones not listed should be contacted. The other one suggests the customers get in touch with a pre-defined list of merchants who bill their cards automatically. The other difference between the two notification samples is that only some of the customers who were affected have also been issued a card with a new account number. BleepingComputer contacted Discover Financial Services asking for more details regarding the data breach, but did not receive an answer prior to publication. We will update if that changes. Update 1/28/19 9:16 PM EST: Discover issued a statement by replying to our tweet: ""We can confirm this incident did not involve any Discover systems and we are forwarding this to the appropriate parties for review. We're aware of a possible merchant data breach & are monitoring accounts. Our members can rest assured they’re never responsible for unauthorized purchases on their Discover card accounts. *Shawni"" Whether you're cleaning up old keys or setting guardrails for AI-generated code, this guide helps your team build securely from the start.

"T-Mobile Data Breach Exposes Customer's Personal, Financial Info",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/t-mobile-data-breach-exposes-customer-personal-financial-info/,Lawrence Abrams,"March 5, 2020","T-Mobile has announced a data breach caused by an email vendor being hacked that exposed the personal and financial information for some of its customers. In 'Notices of Data Breach' posted to their web site, T-Mobile states that their email vendor was hacked and an unauthorized person was able to gain access to T-Mobile employee's email accounts. Some of the email accounts that were hacked contained T-Mobile customer information such as social security numbers, financial information, government ID numbers, billing information, and rate plans. To alert customers of the data breach, yesterday T-Mobile began texting customers affected by the data breach. These texts state that T-Mobile ""recently identified and shut down a security event involving some of your account information"" and contain a link to a page containing more information. These text messages contain a link to one of the two ""Notice of Data Breach"" pages on T-Mobile's site depending on what data was exposed. For users who had their financial information exposed, they will be directed to https://www.t-mobile.com/responsibility/consumer-info/pii-notice . ""The personal information accessed could include names and addresses, Social Security numbers, financial account information, and government identification numbers , as well as phone numbers, billing and account information, and rate plans and features."" For those who did not have their financial information impacted, they will be directed to https://www.t-mobile.com/responsibility/consumer-info/cpni-notice . ""The information accessed may have included customer names and addresses, phone numbers, account numbers, rate plans and features, and billing information. Your financial information (including credit card information) and Social Security number were not impacted ."" Please note, the bolded text above was done by BleepingComputer to illustrate the difference between the two notices. For customers whose financial information was exposed, T-Mobile is offering a free two-year subscription to the my TrueIdentity online credit monitoring service. For customers who did not have financial information exposed, T-Mobile is not offering anything. While the data breach notifications do not indicate that passwords were accessed, I strongly suggest you change your password at t-mobile.com. If your original password is also used at other sites, you should change them there as well to a unique password. All customers impacted by this data breach should be on the lookout for targeted phishing scams. These phishing scams could pretend to be from T-Mobile or use the accessed information to gain your information at other companies. It is not known how many T-Mobile customers were affected or when the breach occurred. BleepingComputer has contacted T-Mobile for more information but has not heard back as of yet. In 2018, T-Mobile customers were affected by a data breach after an unauthorized user hacked into the T-Mobile systems. During this attack, the attacker was able to gain access to customer names, billing ZIP codes, phone numbers, email addresses, account numbers, and account types (prepaid or postpaid). T-Mobile suffered another data breach last year that affected its pre-paid customers . As part of that breach, an attacker gained access to the name and billing address (if provided when establishing an account), phone number, account number, and rate plan and features of pre-paid customers.

Hacker leaks 386 million user records from 18 companies for free,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacker-leaks-386-million-user-records-from-18-companies-for-free/,Lawrence Abrams,"July 28, 2020","A threat actor is flooding a hacker forum with databases exposing expose over 386 million user records that they claim were stolen from eighteen companies during data breaches. Since July 21st, a seller of data breaches known as ShinyHunters has begun leaking the databases for free on a hacker forum known for selling and sharing stolen data. ShinyHunters has been involved in or responsible for a wide assortment of data breaches this past year, including Wattpad, Dave, Chatbooks, Promo.com, Mathway, HomeChef, and the breach of Microsoft private GitHub repository . Databases stolen in data breaches usually are privately sold first, with prices ranging between $500 (Zoosk) to $100,000 (Wattpad). Once they are no longer profitable, threat actors commonly release them on hacker forums to increase their community reputation. Of the databases released since July 21st, nine of them were already disclosed in some manner in the past. The other nine, including Havenly, Indaba Music, Ivoy, Proctoru, Rewards1, Scentbird, and Vakinha, have not been previously disclosed. The full list of the 18 data breaches are listed below: From the samples seen of these databases, BleepingComputer has confirmed that the exposed email addresses correspond to accounts on the services. The combined databases expose over 386 million user records. While a password is not included in every record, for example, promo.com , there is still a massive amount of information being disclosed that threat actors can use. When BleepingComputer asked ShinyHunters why they dumped all of these databases, we were told that they were leaked for everyone's benefit. ""I just thought: 'I've made enough money now' so I leaked for everyone's benefit."" ""Obviously, some people are a little upset because they paid resellers a few days ago, but I don't care,"" ShinyHunters told BleepingComputer. BleepingComputer has contacted each of the companies being offered for free by ShinyHunters, but have not heard back from any of them. This lack of response is common when a data breach is reported, and usually weeks, if not months later, the company will report a data breach. To be safe, if you are a user of one of the services listed above, I strongly advise you to change your password immediately on the site. If you use the same password at other sites, you should also change the password at those sites to a unique and strong one that you only use for that site. Using unique passwords prevents a data breach at one site from affecting you at other websites you use. To assist you in keeping tracking of unique and strong passwords, I suggest you use a password manager application. Thx to Cyble for the tip.

In an internal memo sent to employees on May 3rd and seen by BleepingComputer, the company revealed that customer and supplier data in the U.S. and Canada, as well as personal information belonging to U.S. employees, may have been impacted in the incident. ""On March 5, 2023, Sysco became aware of a cybersecurity event perpetrated by a threat actor believed to have begun on January 14, 2023, in which the threat actor gained access to our systems without authorization and claimed to have acquired certain data,"" Sysco added in data breach notification letters sent to some of the affected individuals. In total, the data breach affected 126,243 who had their names and other personal identifiers exposed together with Social Security Numbers, as revealed in a filing with the Maine Attorney General's Office Sysco also confirmed the security breach in a 10-Q quarterly report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission one week ago, on May 2nd. ""The investigation determined that the threat actor extracted certain company data, including data relating to operation of the business, customers, employees and personal data,"" the company said. ""The investigation is ongoing, and Sysco has begun the process of preparing to comply with its obligations with respect to the extracted data."" The company believes the employees' data stolen from its systems during the breach is a combination of the following: personal information provided to Sysco for payroll purposes, including name, social security number, account numbers, or similar info. Sysco also hired a cybersecurity firm to help investigate the incident and notified federal law enforcement of the cyberattack. The incident has not impacted its business operations, and customer service has not been interrupted, according to the 10-Q SEC filing. Sysco also told affected individuals that there is no ongoing threat to its network and that its security team implemented additional safeguards to prevent a similar breach from occurring in the future.

As the world's global foodservice retailer, McDonald's serves almost hundreds of millions of customers every day in more than 39,000 locations in over 100 countries, including roughly 14,000 restaurants in the US alone. Today, the company said that threat actors breached its systems in multiple markets worldwide, as discovered following an investigation conducted by external security consultants. McDonald's also told US employees that the attackers could only steal business contact info belonging to US employees and franchises that wasn't personal or sensitive, as first reported by WSJ . The threat actors also stole personal information (including names, emails, phone numbers, and addresses) from customers in South Korea and Taiwan, However, the number of customer documents exposed in the incident was small, and the breach did not impact customers' payment info in any way. ""While we were able to close off access quickly after identification, our investigation has determined that a small number of files were accessed, some of which contained personal data,"" McDonald's said in a statement to BleepingComputer. ""Based on our investigation, only Korea and Taiwan had customer personal data accessed, and they will be taking steps to notify regulators and customers listed in these files. ""No customer payment information was contained in these files. In the coming days, a few additional markets will take steps to address files that contained employee personal data. "" The fast-food chain is currently notifying affected customers and relevant authorities in all impacted markets. McDonald’s understands the importance of effective security measures to protect information, which is why we’ve made substantial investments to implement multiple security tools as part of our in-depth cybersecurity defense. These tools allowed us to quickly identify and contain recent unauthorized activity on our network. A thorough investigation was conducted, and we worked with experienced third parties to support this investigation. — McDonald's This is not the first time McDonald's had to deal with a security incident in recent years. In 2017, the company was forced to fix a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability affecting its official website and exposing customers' plain text passwords . As revealed by security researcher Tijme Gommers who discovered the bug, attackers could've exploited the security flaw by crafting a malicious link. When clicked by a target, it would extract and decrypt password data from a local cookie and send it to the attacker in cleartext. Extracting any user's passwords was possible because McDonald's stored password information in a cookie file protected using the same key and initialization vector for all users. In related news, gaming giant Electronic Arts (EA) also confirmed on Thursday that threat actors hacked its network and stole ""a limited amount of code and related tools.""

Travel and passport information remains unaffected, the air carrier says, but personal and financial details of 380.000 customers were accessed by an unauthorized party. ""We will be contacting affected customers directly to advise them of what has happened and are advising them to contact their banks or credit card providers and follow their recommended advice,"" British Airways says in a statement . All operations are running normally at the moment, but users are advised to change their passwords and choose a unique and strong one. The air carrier also recommends affected customers to call their bank and follow their instructions, to minimize potential financial damage. To make sure their message reaches a large portion of its customers, British Airways pinned the breach announcement on its Twitter page, for all its 1.17 million followers to see. We are investigating the theft of customer data from our website and our mobile app, as a matter of urgency. For more information, please click the following link: https://t.co/2dMgjw1p4r “We are deeply sorry for the disruption that this criminal activity has caused. We take the protection of our customers’ data very seriously,” said Alex Cruz, British Airways’ Chairman and Chief Executive. Publicly announcing the incident this way is not only a good method to inform customers, but it may also help the air carrier get a smaller fine from UK's data protection watchdog, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). The move is also accord with GDPR provisions, which require organizations in the UK to report certain types of personal data breach to ICO within 72 hours of learning about the incident. If the breach affects individuals' rights and freedoms, they should also receive a notification without delay. If the organization cannot identify the persons affected by the breach, it would make sense that a public announcement of this magnitude to count as notification. A similar incident was reported by Air Canada on August 28. Data from the mobile application had been accessed without authorization during a two-day interval, forcing the company to lock all its 1.7 million accounts. 20,000 customers were affected by that incident. The intruder could steal at least the owner's name, email address, and telephone number, because this is the required information for the mobile app account. It's budget season!

According to Cathay Pacific, suspicious activity was first detected in March, and when detected, an investigation was started with the help of a cyber security firm to determine how the attackers gained access to their systems and for assistance fixing the breach. As part of this investigation, they learned in May that attackers were able to gain access to systems that contained the personal data of up to 9.4 million passengers. In a security notice , the airline has stated that the following information has been accessed: ""The following personal data was accessed: passenger name; nationality; date of birth; phone number; email; address; passport number; identity card number; frequent flyer programme membership number; customer service remarks and historical travel information. In addition, 403 expired credit card numbers were accessed. 27 credit card numbers with no CVV were accessed. The combination of data accessed varies for each affected passenger. No-one’s travel or loyalty profile was accessed in full, and no passwords were compromised. "" The company has also stated that they have no evidence that any of the personal information was misused, but then again it is not known how they would even know this. For those who are affected by the breach, the airline will be sending out notifications from the infosecurity@cathaypacific.com email address. Cathay Pacific has stated that they are only sending emails to members of the Marco Polo Club and Asia Miles or if you are a registered user affected by this breach. If you do not receive an email, but are concerned you are affected, you can create an inquiry to have the airline look into it. Cathay Pacific has apologized for the breach and have stated that they will be strengthening their security measures. “We are very sorry for any concern this data security event may cause our passengers,"" stated Cathay Pacific Chief Executive Officer Rupert Hogg. ""We acted immediately to contain the event, commence a thorough investigation with the assistance of a leading cybersecurity firm, and to further strengthen our IT security measures. Anyone who was affected by this breach should immediately contact their credit card companies and potentially get a new card sent out.

RedDoorz is a Singapore-based hotel management & booking platform with over 1,000 properties across Southeast Asia. Using the website or mobile app, users can register an account to browser available budget hotels and book a reservation. At the end of September 2020, RedDoorz disclosed that they suffered a data breach after an unauthorized person accessed one of their databases. At the time, though, no RedDoorz financial information or passwords were exposed ""to the best of its knowledge."" This week a threat actor began selling a database containing 5.8 million user records that were stolen during RedDoorz's data breach. As part of the sale, the threat actor shared a database sample, including the table structure and records for 587 users. These records allow us to see what was exposed during the RedDoorz breach. For each user records in the database, a RedDoorz member's email, bcrypt hashed passwords, full name, gender, link to profile photo, phone number, secondary phone number, date of birth, and occupation is exposed. For numerous user records in the samples, BleepingComputer has confirmed that the listed email addresses and phone numbers are correct for the particular user. While this data breach exposed far more sensitive data than initially stated by RedDoorz, it does not contain any financial information. To be safe, if you are a RedDoorz user, you should immediately change your password. If you use the same password at other sites, you should also change the password at those sites to a unique and strong one for that site. Using unique passwords at every site you have an account prevents a data breach at one site from affecting you at other websites you use. It is suggested that you use a password manager to help you keep track of unique and robust passwords at every site.

Since its founding in 1972, the venture capital (VC) firm Sequoia has invested in a long list of high-profile companies (e.g., Apple, NVIDIA, Google, Oracle, Yahoo, LinkedIn, YouTube, Paypal, Electronic Arts, and Cisco). The VC giant also backed many start-ups, including Airbnb, Dropbox, FireEye, Palo Alto Networks, Stripe, Square, and WhatsApp. In total, the companies Sequoia has backed and invested in over the years now have an ""aggregate, public market value of over $3.3 trillion."" Two months ago, the FBI warned US companies about scammers actively abusing email auto-forwarding rules to increase the BEC attacks' success rate. BEC fraudsters use a combination of social engineering, phishing, and hacking to compromise business email accounts with the end goal of redirecting payments to bank accounts under their control. ""On or about January 20, 2021, we learned that an unauthorized third party had gained remote access to the business email mailbox of one Sequoia employee, with the apparent aim of conducting a wired version scam,"" Sequoia Capital explained in a notice of data breach sent to affected individuals. While the attackers were able to breach the employee's email inbox, they didn't gain access to other resources or assets on the company's network. ""Our investigation has found no evidence of compromise beyond this single mailbox,"" Sequoia said. Even though a single mailbox was impacted in the incident, the VC firm acknowledged that it might have allowed the threat actors to exfiltrate impacted individuals' personal information. ""The unauthorized access to the mailbox might have allowed the third party to acquire a copy of files including certain individuals’ personal information,"" Sequoia added. ""As part of our investigation, we have analyzed the contents of the affected email mailbox and determined that it contained your personal information and that the unauthorized third party might have accessed or acquired a copy of it."" After detecting the attack, Sequoia Capital hired external security experts to investigate the incident and secure its systems. Sequoia said that it found no evidence that exfiltrated data was being sold or traded by cybercriminals on the dark web. The company also informed relevant law enforcement authorities of the attack and has taken a series of measures to similar incidents in the future as it has: Sequoia offers impacted individuals 24 months of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection through Experian. Axios reported over the weekend about the VC firm informing investors that it was hacked and that their information might have been compromised as part of a data breach. ""We regret that this incident has occurred and have notified affected individuals,"" a Sequoia Capital spokesperson said.

The company said the attackers used login information stolen from other online platforms to breach as many active Roku accounts as possible in credential stuffing attacks. In such attacks, the threat actors leverage automated tools to attempt millions of logins using a list of user/password pairs, with this technique being particularly effective against accounts whose owners have reused the same login information across multiple platforms. ""After concluding our investigation of [the] first incident, we [..] continued to monitor account activity closely [and] we identified a second incident, which impacted approximately 576,000 additional accounts,"" Roku said on Friday . ""There is no indication that Roku was the source of the account credentials used in these attacks or that Roku's systems were compromised in either incident."" ""In less than 400 cases, malicious actors logged in and made unauthorized purchases of streaming service subscriptions and Roku hardware products using the payment method stored in these accounts, but they did not gain access to any sensitive information, including full credit card numbers or other full payment information."" As BleepingComputer reported in March , threat actors are using credential stuffing attacks with Open Bullet 2 or SilverBullet cracking tools to compromise Roku accounts, which are then sold for as little as 50 cents on illegal marketplaces. The sellers also provide information on using the stolen accounts to make fraudulent purchases, including Roku streaming boxes, sound bars, light strips, and TVs. After discovering this second wave of credential stuffing attacks, Roku has reset the passwords for all impacted accounts and is notifying affected customers directly about the incident. The company will also refund and reverse charges for accounts where the attackers used the linked payment information to pay for Roku hardware products and streaming service subscriptions. Since the last incident, Roku has also added support for two-factor authentication (2FA) and has now enabled it by default for all customer accounts, even for those that these recent attacks have not impacted. Customers are also advised to choose strong and unique passwords for their accounts and alert Roku's customer support if they receive requests to share their credentials, update their payment details, or click suspicious links. Last month, Roku disclosed another data breach that impacted an additional 15,363 customers of a total of over 80 million active users after their accounts were also used to make fraudulent purchases of streaming subscriptions and Roku hardware.

Episource is an American healthcare services company that provides risk adjustment, medical coding, data analytics, and technology solutions to health plans and providers. They help insurers optimize payments and compliance in government programs like Medicare Advantage. In a data breach notification on its website, Episource says it detected unusual activity on its systems on February 6, 2025. An investigation revealed that hackers accessed and exfiltrated sensitive data stored on these systems between January 27 and the time of the discovery. ""We learned from our investigation that a cybercriminal was able to see and take copies of some data in our computer systems,"" explains Episource . ""This happened between January 27, 2025 and February 6, 2025. To date, we are not aware of any misuse of the data."" The exposed data varied per individual but may include one or more of the following data types: The statement underlines that no banking or payment card information has been exposed due to this incident. A filing at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights's breach portal says the cyberattack impacted 5,418,866 people. Although Episource has begun notifying impacted individuals since April 23, 2025, the number of exposed people was submitted to the authorities on June 6 and published yesterday. Episource serves multiple healthcare providers and insurers, and the data exposed in this incident comes from these clients. The notice does not name any specific providers whose data was involved, and Episource says not all of its clients were impacted by this incident. The notifications sent to affected patients are on behalf of Episource's clients, so these people will not be receiving separate notices from the providers.

American Express is warning customers that credit cards were exposed in a third-party data breach after a merchant processor was hacked. This incident was not caused by a data breach at American Express, but rather at a merchant processor in which American Express Card member data was processed. In a data breach notification filed with the state of Massachusetts under ""American Express Travel Related Services Company,"" the company warned customers their credit cards may have been stolen. ""We became aware that a third party service provider engaged by numerous merchants experienced unauthorized access to its system,"" explains the data breach notification. ""Account information of some of our Card Members, including some of your account information, may have been involved. It is important to note that American Express owned or controlled systems were not compromised by this incident, and we are providing this notice to you as a precautionary measure."" The breach has led to customers' American Express Card account numbers, names, and card expiration data being accessed by the hackers. It is unclear how many customers were impacted, what merchant processor was breached, and when the attack occurred. When BleepingComputer asked American Express for more information about the breach, we were told that they do not disclose details of their business relationships and merchant partners and had no further information to share at this time. However, American Express did say that they have notified the required regulatory authorities and are alerting impacted customers. ""When we learn about a data security incident that impacts our customers, we promptly begin an investigation and notify the appropriate regulatory authorities, as required,"" American Express told BleepingComputer. ""We also work to identify impacted customers and understand the specific impacts, and then notify them as required by applicable laws and regulations. Furthermore, if a cardmember's credit card is used to make fraudulent purchases, American Express told BleepingComputer that customers would not be responsible for the charges. American Express advises customers to review their account statement over the next 12 to 24 months and report any suspicious behavior. The company also suggests customers enable instant notifications via the American Express mobile app to receive notifications about fraud alerts and when purchases are made. Finally, if your card information was stolen, you may want to consider requesting a new card number, as it is common for threat actors to sell stolen credit cards on cybercrime marketplaces.

According to Dan Rice, VP of Corporate Communications at GoDaddy, the six resellers also impacted by this massive breach are tsoHost , Media Temple , 123Reg , Domain Factory , Heart Internet , and Host Europe . GoDaddy acquired these brands after buying web hosting and cloud services companies Host Europe Group in 2017 and Media Temple in 2013 . "" A small number of active and inactive Managed WordPress users at those brands were impacted by the security incident,"" Rice told WordPress security firm Wordfence. ""No other brands are impacted.

The data breach was discovered by GoDaddy last Wednesday , on November 17, but, as separately revealed in a Monday filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the customers' data was exposed since at least September 6, 2021, after unknown threat actors had access to the company's Managed WordPress hosting environment. ""Our investigation is ongoing, but we have determined that, on or about September 6, 2021, an unauthorized third party gained access to certain authentication information for administrative services, specifically, your customer number and email address associated with your account; your WordPress Admin login set at inception; and your sFTP and database usernames and passwords,"" GoDaddy told customers in data breach notification letters sent this week. ""What this means is the unauthorized party could have obtained the ability to access your Managed WordPress service and make changes to it, including to alter your website and the content stored on it."" The attackers had access to the following GoDaddy customer information after breaching the company's provisioning system for Managed WordPress: GoDaddy has not yet published a public statement regarding this data breach on its website.

Another breach was revealed last year , in May, when GoDaddy alerted customers that hackers used their web hosting account credentials to connect to their hosting account via SSH. GoDaddy's security team discovered the breach after finding an altered SSH file in the company's hosting environment and noticing suspicious activity on a subset of GoDaddy's servers. In 2019, GoDaddy injected JavaScript into US customers' sites without their knowledge, potentially rendering them inoperable or impacting the websites' overall performance.

Hackers leak Allianz Life data stolen in Salesforce attacks,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-leak-allianz-life-data-stolen-in-salesforce-attacks/#comment_form,Lawrence Abrams,"August 12, 2025","Hackers have released stolen data belonging to US insurance giant Allianz Life, exposing 2.8 million records with sensitive information on business partners and customers in ongoing Salesforce data theft attacks. Last month, Allianz Life disclosed that it suffered a data breach when the personal information for the ""majority"" of its 1.4 million customers was stolen from a third-party, cloud-based CRM system on July 16th. While the company did not name the provider, BleepingComputer first reported the incident was part of a wave of Salesforce-targeted thefts carried out by the ShinyHunters extortion group. Over the weekend, ShinyHunters and other threat actors claiming overlap with ""Scattered Spider"" and ""Lapsus$"" created a Telegram channel called "" ScatteredLapsuSp1d3rHunters"" to taunt cybersecurity researchers, law enforcement, and journalists while taking credit for a string of high-profile breaches. Many of these attacks had not previously been attributed to any threat actor, including the attacks on Internet Archive , Pearson , and Coinbase . One of the attacks claimed by the threat actors is Allianz Life, for which they proceeded to leak the complete databases that were stolen from the company's Salesforce instances. These files consist of the Salesforce "" Accounts "" and "" Contacts "" database tables, containing approximately 2.8 million data records for individual customers and business partners, such as wealth management companies, brokers, and financial advisors. The leaked Salesforce data includes sensitive personal information, such as names, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, and Tax Identification Numbers, as well as professional details like licenses, firm affiliations, product approvals, and marketing classifications. BleepingComputer has been able to confirm with multiple people that their data in the leaked files is accurate, including their phone numbers, email addresses, tax IDs, and other information contained in the database. BleepingComputer contacted Allianz Life about the leaked database but was told that they could not comment as the investigation is ongoing. The Salesforce data theft attacks are believed to have started at the beginning of the year, with the threat actors conducting social engineering attacks to trick employees into linking a malicious OAuth app with their company's Salesforce instances. Once linked, the threat actors used the connection to download and steal the databases, which were then used to extort the company through email. Extortion demands were sent to the companies via email and were signed as coming from ShinyHunters. This notorious extortion group has been linked to many high-profile attacks over the years, including those against AT&T , PowerSchool , and the SnowFlake attacks . While ShinyHunters is known to target cloud SaaS applications and website databases, they are not known for these types of social engineering attacks, causing many researchers and the media to attribute some of the Salesforce attacks to Scattered Spider. However, ShinyHunters told BleepingComputer the ""ShinyHunters"" group and ""Scattered Spider"" are now one and the same. ""Like we have said repeatedly already, ShinyHunters and Scattered Spider are one and the same,"" ShinyHunters told BleepingComputer. ""They provide us with initial access and we conduct the dump and exfiltration of the Salesforce CRM instances. Just like we did with Snowflake."" It is also believed that many of the group's members share their roots in another hacking group known as Lapsus$, which was responsible for numerous attacks in 2022-2023, before some of their members were arrested . Lapsus$ was behind breaches at Rockstar Games , Uber , 2K , Okta , T-Mobile , Microsoft , Ubisoft , and NVIDIA . Like Scattered Spider, Lapsus$ was also adept at social engineering attacks and SIM swap attacks, allowing them to run over billion and trillion-dollar companies' IT defenses. Over the past couple of years, there have been many arrests linked to all three collectives , so it's not clear if the current threat actors are old threat actors, new ones who have picked up the mantle, or are simply utilizing these names to plant false flags.

The U.S. mortgage and long term care insurer had revenue of $8,6 billion during the last fiscal year and it reached a deal with China Oceanwide Holdings Group that will allow the Chinese company to buy Genworth for $2.7 billion. Genworth's services and products are offered through financial advisors, intermediaries, as well as sales specialists and independent distributors. The data breach was discovered by Genworth on April 20, 2020, after the company detected unauthorized access to some insurance agents' online accounts, providing access to documents containing both personal and financial information. ""We immediately began investigating the series of events that led to the unauthorized access and discovered compromised login credentials for your agent to our online portal where insurance agents and producers manage their policies,"" the breach notification letters [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] sent by Genworth's Data Security Team explain. Depending on the accounts that were compromised, the attackers were able to access online documents that contained some of the following information, in various combinations: name, address, age, gender, date of birth, financial information, social security number, and signature. As a direct result of an ongoing investigation examining the incident, Genworth disabled the compromised user accounts to block future access to sensitive information. While the company disabled access to the impacted user accounts, it still monitors the accounts and the policies for suspicious behavior. ""At this point, there has been no evidence of further unauthorized activity,"" Genworth stated. Genworth also said that it contacted relevant federal authorities to investigate and address the breach incident. The company offers a one-year subscription of credit monitoring and resolution services with ID Experts to affected individuals as a protection measure against fraud and identity theft. ""Fraudulent actors obtained the login credentials of a limited number of third party insurance agents, which they obtained outside of Genworth,"" Public Relations Senior Director Julie Westermann told BleepingComputer. ""The perpetrators used these stolen credentials to log on to a website used only by insurance agents to potentially compromise 1,600 individuals’ data that had been submitted on their insurance or annuity applications. ""We were able to verify that Genworth systems/infrastructure were not breached, and the limited data that may have been viewable was limited solely to the policies associated with the agents whose credentials were compromised."" Genworth previously disclosed another data breach during 2014 after federal law enforcement officials notified the company in December 2013 that ""Genworth Group Long Term Care (LTC) certificate holders’ information was recovered during a criminal investigation.""

Compared to previous data breaches reported by T-Mobile, the latest of which impacted 37 million people , this incident affected only 836 customers. Still, the amount of exposed information is highly extensive and exposes affected individuals to identity theft and phishing attacks. ""In March 2023, the measures we have in place to alert us to unauthorized activity worked as designed and we were able to determine that a bad actor gained access to limited information from a small number of T-Mobile accounts between late February and March 2023,"" the company said in data breach notification letters sent to affected individuals just before the weekend, on Friday, April 28, 2023. T-Mobile said the threat actors didn't gain access to call records or affected individuals' personal financial account info, but the exposed personally identifiable information contains more than enough data for identity theft. While the exposed information varied for each of the affected customers, it could include ""full name, contact information, account number and associated phone numbers, T-Mobile account PIN, social security number, government ID, date of birth, balance due, internal codes that T-Mobile uses to service customer accounts (for example, rate plan and feature codes), and the number of lines."" After detecting the security breach, T-Mobile proactively reset account PINs for impacted customers and now offers them two years of free credit monitoring and identity theft detection services through Transunion myTrueIdentity. A T-Mobile spokesperson was not immediately available for comment when contacted by BleepingComputer earlier today to ask for more details. This is the second such incident T-Mobile has revealed since the start of the year, with the previous data breach disclosed on January 19, after attackers stole the personal information of 37 million customers by abusing a vulnerable Application Programming Interface (API) in November 2022. The mobile carrier spotted the threat actors' malicious activity on January 5 and cut off their access to its systems within 24 hours. T-Mobile described the data stolen in the January breach as ""basic customer information,"" including ""name, billing address, email, phone number, date of birth, T-Mobile account number and information such as the number of lines on the account and plan features."" Since 2018, the mobile carrier has disclosed seven other data breaches, including one that exposed the information of roughly 3% of all T-Mobile customers . Other incidents reported by T-Mobile during the last few years include: Update May 01, 16:25 EDT: A T-Mobile spokesperson provided the following statement after the article was published, but didn't reply to a follow-up email asking for more info on how the credentials used in the incident were compromised and if they belonged to employees. We notified a small number of customers that our systems and processes worked to detect and stop a bad actor who was accessing accounts using compromised credentials. No personal financial account information or call records were included. We take these issues seriously and have taken steps to proactively protect the impacted customer accounts and to help prevent recurrence.

This was revealed in data breach notification letters sent to employees affected by the data breach, who had some of their personal and health information accessed, while the threat actors had access to an email and document storage system used by several News Corp businesses. The incident affected multiple news arms of the publishing conglomerate, including The Wall Street Journal, the New York Post, and its U.K. news operations. ""Based on the investigation, News Corp understands that, between February 2020 and January 2022, an unauthorized party gained access to certain business documents and emails from a limited number of its personnel's accounts in the affected system, some of which contained personal information,"" the company said. ""Our investigation indicates that this activity does not appear to be focused on exploiting personal information. We are not aware of reports of identity theft or fraud in connection with this issue."" According to News Corp, personal information accessed by the attackers includes one or more of the following for each individual affected by the data breach: The media giant said last year, when it first disclosed this security breach , that the attackers are associated with a ""foreign government,"" and they exfiltrated some data during the time they had access to its systems. ""Mandiant assesses that those behind this activity have a China nexus, and we believe they are likely involved in espionage activities to collect intelligence to benefit China's interests,"" David Wong, VP of incident response at Mandiant, told BleepingComputer at the time. News Corp's properties include New York Post, The Wall Street Journal, Dow Jones, MarketWatch, Fox News, Barron's, The Sun, and the News UK British newspaper publisher, among others. On October 27, 2022, the New York Post also disclosed that it was ha cked after unknown attackers used its website and Twitter account to publish offensive headlines and tweets targeting multiple U.S. politicians.

While officials discovered the incident on May 24 following suspicious activity in the City's email environment, the investigation found that the threat actors may have accessed emails in the compromised email accounts for at least two months after the City became aware of the incident. ""However, to date, the investigation determined that between May 26, 2023 and July 28, 2023, an unauthorized actor may have gained access to certain City email accounts and certain information contained therein,"" the breach notice says . ""Also, on August 22, 2023, we became aware that the at-issue email accounts include email accounts that may contain protected health information."" While the investigation and a manual review of the affected email accounts are still ongoing, the City revealed that the types of information exposed for impacted individuals include a combination of: ""In an abundance of caution, we are conducting a comprehensive, programmatic and manual review of the potentially impacted email accounts to determine whether personal information or protected health information was potentially affected,"" the notice says. ""If so, the City will work to confirm the identities and contact information for potentially impacted individuals and provide notice via written letter."" City officials also urged individuals who may have been affected to stay vigilant against financial fraud attempts and potential incidents of identity theft. They advised monitoring credit reports and account statements closely, enabling individuals to promptly inform their insurance company, healthcare provider, or bank about any suspicious activity. City officials are yet to provide details on how the attackers breached the City's email accounts and the reasons behind the delay in disclosing the incident for five months. As reported by The Philadelphia Inquirer , the City's Department of Behavioral Health and Intellectual Disability Services (DBHIDS) also disclosed a HIPAA breach in June 2020 after the personal health information of individuals it served was compromised following a March phishing attack. A breach notice revealed that the email accounts of DBHIDS and Community Behavioral Health employees were hacked in the phishing attack and were accessed by the attackers between March 31 and November 15, 2020.

DoorDash discloses new data breach tied to Twilio hackers,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/doordash-discloses-new-data-breach-tied-to-twilio-hackers/#comment_form,Lawrence Abrams,"August 26, 2022","Food delivery firm DoorDash has disclosed a data breach exposing customer and employee data that is linked to the recent cyberattack on Twilio. In a security advisory released Thursday afternoon, DoorDash says that a threat actor gained access to the company's internal tools using stolen credentials from a third-party vendor that had access to their systems. ""DoorDash recently detected unusual and suspicious activity from a third-party vendor's computer network. In response, we swiftly disabled the vendor's access to our system and contained the incident,"" explains the DoorDash security notice. The hacker used this access to DoorDash's internal tools to access data for both consumers and employees. The exposed information includes the names, email addresses, delivery addresses, and phone numbers of consumers. In addition, for a small subset of customers, the hackers accessed basic order information and partial credit card information, including the card type and the last four digits of the card number. For employees of the company, known as Dashers, the hackers may have accessed names, phone numbers, and email addresses. While DoorDash does not mention the name of the third-party vendor, the food delivery company told TechCrunch that the breach is linked to same threat actors who recently attacked Twilio. DoorDash previously suffered a data breach in 2019 that exposed the data of nearly 5 million customers. Earlier this month, Twilio disclosed that they were breached after multiple employees fell for an SMS phishing attack that allowed threat actors to access internal systems. Using this access, the threat actors could access the data of 163 Twilio customers and use that data in further supply-chain attacks. ""To date, our investigation has identified 163 Twilio customers - out of a total customer base of over 270,000 - whose data was accessed without authorization for a limited period of time, and we have notified all of them,"" explains an updated Twilio security advisory . The fallout from this attack is just being realized, with Twilio disclosing this week that the hackers were also able to access 93 Authy 2FA accounts as part of the breach. Signal also disclosed that the breach allowed hackers to access the phone numbers of 1,900 users, with some accounts reregistered to new devices. However, the attack on Twilio and DoorDash is part of a much larger phishing campaign dubbed 'Oktapus' after the threat actor's targeting of Okta identity management login credentials. The campaign was discovered by cybersecurity firm Group-IB, which said that the threat actors breached over 130 organizations worldwide using an SMS phishing campaign. These SMS phishing texts utilized phishing domains containing the keywords ""OKTA,"" ""HELP,"" ""VPN,"" and ""SSO"" and told targets to click on a link to update their password or access other information. These attacks were very successful, leading to additional reported data breaches at MailChimp and Klaviyo and an attempted breach of Cloudflare . Other companies targeted in the attack include Coinbase, KuCoin, Binance, Microsoft, Telus, Verizon Wireless, T-Mobile, AT&T, Sprint, Rogers, Mailgun, Slack, Box, SendGrid, Yahoo, Sykes, BestBuy, and Infosys. However, none of these other companies have disclosed whether the attacks were successful. 8/26/22 update: Story updated to clarify that the DoorDash breach was conducted by the same hackers as Twilio but not through Twilio It's budget season!

Bank of America warns customers of data breach after vendor hack,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bank-of-america-warns-customers-of-data-breach-after-vendor-hack/,Sergiu Gatlan,"February 12, 2024","Bank of America is warning customers of a data breach exposing their personal information after Infosys McCamish Systems (IMS), one of its service providers, was hacked last year. Customer personally identifiable information (PII) exposed in the security breach includes the affected individuals' names, addresses, social security numbers, dates of birth, and financial information, including account and credit card numbers, according to details shared with the Attorney General of Texas. Bank of America serves approximately 69 million clients at over 3,800 retail financial centers and through approximately 15,000 ATMs in the United States, its territories, and more than 35 countries. A Bank of America spokesperson declined to comment when BleepingComputer reached out for more details and asked us to connect with Infosys McCamish. While Bank of America has yet to disclose how many customers were impacted by the data breach, an IMS breach notification letter filed with the Attorney General of Maine on behalf of Bank of America revealed that a total of 57,028 people were directly impacted. ""Or around November 3, 2023, IMS was impacted by a cybersecurity event when an unauthorized third party accessed IMS systems, resulting in the non-availability of certain IMS applications,"" the data breach notification says . ""On November 24, 2023, IMS told Bank of America that data concerning deferred compensation plans serviced by Bank of America may have been compromised. Bank of America's systems were not compromised."" ""It is unlikely that we will be able to determine with certainty what personal information was accessed as a result of this incident at IMS."" The November security breach led to a ""non-availability of certain applications and systems in IMS,"" as explained when the incident was first disclosed in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. On November 4th, the LockBit ransomware gang claimed responsibility for the IMS attack , saying that its operators encrypted over 2,000 systems during the breach. The LockBit ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation came to light in September 2019 and has since targeted many high-profile organizations, including the UK Royal Mail , the Continental automotive giant , the City of Oakland , and the Italian Internal Revenue Service . In June, cybersecurity authorities in the United States and partners worldwide released a joint advisory estimating that the LockBit gang has extorted at least $91 million from U.S. organizations following roughly 1,700 attacks since 2020. Infosys, IMS' parent company, is a multinational IT consulting and services provider giant with over 300,000 employees and clients in over 56 countries. An Infosys spokesperson has yet to respond to a BleepingComputer request for confirmation of LockBit's claims and further information about the security breach. Bank of America customers' financial account information, credit card, social security, and/or other unique government-issued identification numbers handled by leading accounting firm Ernst & Young were also exposed after the service provider's MOVEit Transfer platform got breached in May 2023 by the Clop cybercrime gang. ""Bank of America has informed us that its systems and servers were not impacted by this event,"" Ernst & Young disclosed in a filing with the Maine Attorney General, revealing that the May 2023 incident affected 30,210 individuals.

ShinyHunters launches Salesforce data leak site to extort 39 victims,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/shinyhunters-starts-leaking-data-stolen-in-salesforce-attacks/,Sergiu Gatlan,"October 3, 2025","An extortion group has launched a new data leak site to publicly extort dozens of companies impacted by a wave of Salesforce breaches , leaking samples of data stolen in the attacks. The threat actors responsible for these attacks claim to be part of the ShinyHunters, Scattered Spider, and Lapsus$ groups, collectively referring to themselves as ""Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters."" Today, they launched a new data leak site containing 39 companies impacted by the attacks. Each entry includes samples of data allegedly stolen from victims' Salesforce instances, and warns the victims to reach out to ""prevent public disclosure"" of their data before the October 10 deadline is reached. The companies being extorted on the data leak site include well-known brands and organizations, including FedEx, Disney/Hulu, Home Depot, Marriott, Google, Cisco, Toyota, Gap, McDonald's, Walgreens, Instacart, Cartier, Adidas, Sake Fifth Avenue, Air France & KLM, Transunion, HBO MAX, UPS, Chanel, and IKEA. ""All of them have been contacted long ago, they saw the email because I saw them download the samples multiple times. Most of them chose to not disclose and ignore,"" ShinyHunters told BleepingComputer. ""We highly advise you proceed into the right decision, your organisation can prevent the release of this data, regain control over the situation and all operations remain stable as always. We highly recommend a decision-maker to get involved as we are presenting a clear and mutually beneficial opportunity to resolve this matter,"" they warned on the leak site. The threat actors also added a separate entry requesting that Salesforce pay a ransom to prevent all impacted customers' data (approximately 1 billion records containing personal information) from being leaked. ""Should you comply, we will withdraw from any active or pending negotiation indiviually from your customers. Your customers will not be attacked again nor will they face a ransom from us again, should you pay,"" they added. The extortion group also threatened the company, stating that it would help law firms pursue civil and commercial lawsuits against Salesforce following the data breaches and warned that the company had also failed to protect customers' data as required by the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters have been targeting Salesforce customers with voice phishing attacks since the beginning of the year , leading to breaches that have impacted companies such as Google , Cisco , Qantas , Adidas , Allianz Life , Farmers Insurance , Workday , as well as LVMH subsidiaries, including Dior , Louis Vuitton , and Tiffany & Co . In these attacks, the threat actors tricked employees into linking a malicious OAuth app to their company's Salesforce instance. ShinyHunters told BleepingComputer that while a particular Salesforce instance may have been targeted, it also contained data for many of the subsidiaries, making the attacks more impactful. Once connected, the attackers stole company databases and used the data to extort victims via email. These extortion emails were signed by ShinyHunters, a notorious extortion group linked to a long string of high-profile breaches in recent years, including the Snowflake attacks and those against AT&T and PowerSchool . ShinyHunters also claimed to have used stolen OAuth tokens for Salesloft's Drift AI chat integration with Salesforce to steal sensitive information, including passwords, AWS access keys, and Snowflake tokens, from customers' Salesforce instances. These attacks were tracked by Mandiant under a separate threat cluster named ""UNC6395"" as they have been unable to formally link the breaches to this group. On a Telegram channel associated with the extortion group, the threat actors claim that they will begin extorting companies affected by the Salesloft Drift attacks on a separate data leak site launching on October 10th. ShinyHunters previously told BleepingComputer that the Salesloft data theft attacks impacted approximately 760 companies and resulted in the theft of 1.5 billion Salesforce records . The Salesloft attacks are known to have impacted Google , Palo Alto Networks , CyberArk , Cloudflare , Rubrik , Elastic , BeyondTrust , Proofpoint , JFrog , Zscaler , Tenable , Nutanix , Qualys , and Cato Networks , among many others . ShinyHunters claim that companies will not be re-extorted under the Salesloft campaign if a ransom is paid in this initial extortion phase. ""We are aware of recent extortion attempts by threat actors, which we have investigated in partnership with external experts and authorities. Our findings indicate these attempts relate to past or unsubstantiated incidents, and we remain engaged with affected customers to provide support,"" Salesforce said in a statement published after ShinyHunters launched their data leak site. ""At this time, there is no indication that the Salesforce platform has been compromised, nor is this activity related to any known vulnerability in our technology.""

New Samsung data breach impacts UK store customers,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-samsung-data-breach-impacts-uk-store-customers/,Ionut Ilascu,"November 15, 2023","Samsung Electronics is notifying some of its customers of a data breach that exposed their personal information to an unauthorized individual. The company says that the cyberattack impacted only customers who made purchases from the Samsung UK online store between July 1, 2019, and June 30, 2020. Samsung discovered the data breach two days ago, on November 13, and determined that it was the result of a hacker exploiting a vulnerability in a third-party application the company used. No details have been provided about the security issue leveraged in the attack or the vulnerable application that enabled the attacker to access Samsung customer's personal information. The notification to customers says that exposed data may include names, phone numbers, postal and email addresses. The company underlines that credentials or financial information remains unaffected by the incident. A Samsung spokesperson told BleepingComputer that the company was recently alerted of a cybersecurity incident that is limited to the UK region and does not affect data belonging to customers in the U.S., employees, or retailers. “We were recently alerted to a cybersecurity incident, which resulted in certain contact information of some Samsung UK e-store customers being unlawfully obtained. No financial data, such as bank or credit card details, or customer passwords, were impacted. The incident is limited to the UK and does not affect U.S. customers, employees or retailer data” - Samsung The company has taken all necessary steps to address the security issue, the representative told BleepingComputer, adding that the incident has also been reported to the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office. This is the third data breach Samsung has suffered in two years. The previous one occurred in late July , 2022 - discovered on August 4, when hackers accessed and stole Samsung customers' names, contacts and demographic information, dates of birth, and product registration data. In March 2022, the data extortion group Lapsus$ breached Samsung’s network and stole confidential information, including source code for Galaxy smartphones. Samsung confirmed that “certain internal data” had fallen into the hands of an unauthorized party after Lapsus$ leaked about 190GB of archived files along with a description of the contents.

The data comes from a security breach in July 2019 on one of MGM cloud services. In total, there are 10,683,189 records with about 3.1 million unique email addresses as far back as 2017. Among the details compromised are guests' names, dates of birth, email addresses, phone numbers, and physical addresses complete with postal codes. The post sharing the information was spotted by a researcher at Under the Breach , a company that monitors the cybercrime space and currently working on releasing a new service aiming to provide companies intelligence about potential breaches. Not all the information in the files is still valid. ZDNet was able to confirm that in some cases the phone numbers were disconnected; other times, the publication received confirmation from the person answering the phone that the details were real. MGM acknowledged that the data dump resulted from a security incident in 2019. Although we could not find a notification to affected individuals, some members of the Vegas Message Board forum that stayed at MGM Resorts were alerted last summer that their personal data had emerged on the dark web. ""I was at an MGM property in July. My credit card company and an independent credit monitoring service both notified me 19 August that my email was on the dark web and passwords for two sites were compromised"" - Vegas Message Board forum member According to Under the Breach, ZDNet informs, the database contains details of high-profile guests, such as Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, pop star Justin Bieber, and officials from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Transportation Security Administration. The immediate risk of having personal details publicly exposed is receiving targeted phishing messages that could help cybercriminals in their fraudulent activities. The details can also be used to create new accounts in the name of the victim or for synthetic identity fraud, where the cybercriminal needs only some of the information to be valid in order to apply for some service.

Caesars discovered on September 7th that the attackers stole its loyalty program database, which stores driver's license numbers and social security numbers for many customers. ""We are still investigating the extent of any additional personal or otherwise sensitive information contained in the files acquired by the unauthorized actor,"" says an 8-K form filed by Caesars with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday. ""We have no evidence to date that any member passwords/PINs, bank account information, or payment card information (PCI) were acquired by the unauthorized actor."" Caesars' 8-K also implies that a ransom demanded by the attackers was paid to prevent the leak of the stolen data online—a Wall Street Journal report says the hotel and casino entertainment company paid roughly $15 million, half of the attackers' initial $30 million demand. Nonetheless, Caesars made it clear that it cannot provide any assurances regarding the potential actions of the threat actors responsible for the incident, including the possibility that they might still sell or leak the customer's stolen information. ""We have taken steps to ensure that the stolen data is deleted by the unauthorized actor, although we cannot guarantee this result,"" Caesars said. ""We are monitoring the web and have not seen any evidence that the data has been further shared, published, or otherwise misused."" While Caesars didn't link the attack to a specific cybercrime gang or threat actor, a Bloomberg report published on Wednesday claims the attack was conducted by a group known as Scattered Spider . Also tracked as UNC3944 and 0ktapus, this financially motivated threat group has been active since at least May 2022. It uses a combination of social engineering, multi-factor authentication (MFA) fatigue, and SMS credential phishing attacks to steal user credentials and breach targets' networks. According to Caesars, customers not enrolled in Caesars' loyalty program were not impacted by the data breach. The company will notify all affected individuals over the coming weeks. The company said in a separate data breach notification with additional details that it reported the incident to law enforcement. It also added that the attack has not impacted its customer-facing operations, including online/mobile gaming apps and physical properties, as they operate without disruption. Caesars is the second casino chain impacted by a cyberattack recently, with MGM Resorts International disclosing on Monday that it was forced to take its IT systems offline following a cyberattack that affected its websites, reservation systems, and casino services (i.e., ATMs, slot machines, and credit card machines). In 2020, MGM Resorts also disclosed a 2019 cyberattack that led to the breach of its cloud services, allowing the hackers to steal over 10 million customer records .

Over 1M Lazada RedMart accounts sold online after data breach,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/over-1m-lazada-redmart-accounts-sold-online-after-data-breach/,Ax Sharma,"October 30, 2020","Singapore's largest online grocery store Lazada Redmart has suffered a data breach after 1.1 million user accounts were put up for sale on a hacker forum. The database dump containing sensitive customer is priced at $1,500. Lazada is a billion-dollar arm of Alibaba with over 8,000 employees globally. Hackers selling the illicit data dumps told BleepingComputer they had obtained Lazada's MongoDB-based data set with data from over 1.1 million RedMart accounts. The leaked dump contains RedMart customer accounts' email addresses, SHA-1 hashed passwords, first and last name, phone numbers, mailing addresses, billing addresses, partial credit card numbers, and expiration dates. According to the hackers, however, the data set isn't standardized, and that ""some rows have more information than others."" For example, certain customers had the first 6 and last 4 digits of their credit card number included with their data. On October 29th, Lazada sent out an email notification to impacted customers stating they had discovered the breach during ""proactive monitoring"" of their systems. In Lazada's data breach notification, the company claims that the data exposed in the breach is 18 months old. ""The customer data hosted on this database is more than 18 months out of date as it was last updated in March 2019,"" Lazada stated. However, the data breach broker told BleepingComputer in a conversation that the stolen database contains user records with registration dates in May and July 2020, as shown below. The data breach email further reassured customers that their passwords are ""protected by encryption."" While the passwords in the stolen database are indeed SHA-1 hashed, it is possible to dehash them to recover the original password. As a safety precaution, RedMart has reset the passwords on all accounts and will prompt you to change it the next time you login. It is also suggested that you change your password on any other sites utilizing the same one as used on RedMart. RedMart users should also be on the lookout for targeted phishing emails that utilize the information in the stolen database. ""Lazada does not request customers to verify your personal information,"" the breach notification stated. The exact date of the breach remains unknown. When BleepingComputer asked the data breach broker how RedMart was compromised, they declined to share that information. According to RedMart, on discovering the breach, the company took steps to promptly block access to the database. ""We have taken immediate action to block unauthorised access to the database. This data was used on the previous RedMart app and website, which are no longer in use. Lazada customer data in Southeast Asia is not affected by this incident,"" reads the email notification. The company also stated they were reviewing and hardening their security controls in addition to collaborating with the law enforcement authorities on this incident. ""We want to be transparent about this incident with all of our customers and reassure you that we are taking it seriously,"" concluded the notification. But what stands out is the discrepancy between their claim of the leaked data being 18 months old and the database screenshot above showing July 2020 registration dates.

Whoosh confirms data breach after hackers sell 7.2M user records,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/whoosh-confirms-data-breach-after-hackers-sell-72m-user-records/#comment_form,Bill Toulas,"November 14, 2022","The Russian scooter-sharing service Whoosh has confirmed a data breach after hackers started to sell a database containing the details of 7.2 million customers on a hacking forum. Whoosh is Russia's leading urban mobility service platform, operating in 40 cities with over 75,000 scooters. On Friday, a threat actor began selling the stolen data on a hacking forum, which allegedly contains promotion codes that can be used to access the service for free, as well as partial user identification and payment card data. The company confirmed the cyberattack via statements on Russian media earlier this month but claimed that its IT experts had managed to thwart it successfully. In a new statement shared with RIA Novosti today, Whoosh admits that there is a data leak and informs its user base they are working with law enforcement authorities to take all measures to stop the distribution of the data. ""The leak did not affect sensitive user data, such as account access, transaction information, or travel details,"" stated a Whoosh spokesperson. ""Our security procedures also exclude the possibility of third parties gaining access to full payment data of users' bank cards."" On Friday, a user on the 'Breached' hacking forums posted a database containing details about 7.2 millionWhoosh customers, including email addresses, phone numbers, and first names. The database also contained partial payment card details for a subset of 1,900,000 users. The seller also claimed that the stolen data included 3,000,000 promo codes, which people can use to rent Whoosh scooters without paying. The seller says they are selling the data to only five buyers for $4,200 each, or .21490980 bitcoins, and according to the SatoshiDisk platform used for the transaction, no one has yet to purchase the database. In a separate sale of the data on Telegram, the threat actor claims it was stolen during a November 2022 attack on Whoosh. According to an August 2022 report from Roskomnadzor, Russia's internet watchdog, there were 40 confirmed Russian company data breaches since the beginning of the year. In September 2022, Group-IB published a report claiming to have observed 140 database sales stolen from Russian companies this summer alone, with the total number of exposed records reaching 304 million. The most notable leak, in terms of its impact this year, was that of the food delivery app Yandex Food , which led to multiple collateral data exposures .

Associated Press warns that AP Stylebook data breach led to phishing attack,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/associated-press-warns-that-ap-stylebook-data-breach-led-to-phishing-attack/,Lawrence Abrams,"September 10, 2023","The Associated Press is warning of a data breach impacting AP Stylebook customers where the attackers used the stolen data to conduct targeted phishing attacks. The AP Stylebook is a commonly used guide on grammar, punctuation, and writing style for journalists, magazines, and newsrooms worldwide. This week, the Associated press warns that an old third-party-managed AP Stylebook site that was no longer in use was hacked between July 16 and July 22, 2023, allowing the data for 224 customers to be stolen. The stolen information includes a customer's name, email address, street address, city, state, zip code, phone number, and User ID. For customers who entered tax-exempt IDs, such as a Social Security Number or Employer Identification Number, those IDs were stolen as well. The AP says they first learned of the possible data breach on July 20, 2023, after AP Stylebook customers reported receiving phishing emails stating they needed to update their credit card information. After learning of the phishing attack, the AP took the old site and phishing offline to prevent further attacks. At the end of July, the company began alerting AP Stylebook customers of the phishing attacks, warning that the emails came from 'support@getscore.my[.]id' with a subject similar to ""Regarding AP Stylebook Order no. 07/20/2023 06:48:20 am."" The Associated Press also requires all AP Stylebook customers to reset their passwords on the next login. While this was not a significant data breach, with only 224 customers impacted, the login credentials for journalists and media companies are highly sought after by cybercriminals. Gaining access to the network of a media company could lead to a wide variety of attacks, including extortion and ransomware attacks, data theft, and cyber espionage. In the past, local and global media outlets suffered ransomware and cyberespionage attacks, including News Corp , the Philadelphia Inquirer , and German newspaper Heilbronn Stimme . BleepingComputer contacted the Associated Press to learn more about the phishing attack and will update this article if we learn more.

The company is currently in the process of contacting over two million users it believes have been affected by the security breach. CeX said the attacker made off with first names, surnames, addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers if this were supplied. The good news is that CeX stopped collecting credit and debit card details in 2009. The attacker made off with encrypted payment card data, but by now, most of the old card data had expired a long time ago. The company said it started notifying affected users via email. ""If you do not receive an email, your account is not affected,"" CeX said in a statement. Interesting that @cex haven't forced a #password reset... just asked customers to do it instead. Odd. CeX, who runs the WeBuy.com website, is one of the Internet's biggest marketplaces for buying and selling used IT goods, such as computer parts, games, movie DVDs, old music albums, and more. The company also has stores all over the world, in countries such as the US, the UK, Australia, India, Spain, the Netherlands, and several others.

Social Blade confirms breach after hacker posts stolen user data,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/social-blade-confirms-breach-after-hacker-posts-stolen-user-data/,Bill Toulas,"December 15, 2022","Social media analytics platform Social Blade has confirmed they suffered a data breach after its database was breached and put up for sale on a hacking forum. Social Blade is an analytics platform that provides statistical graphs for YouTube, Twitter, Twitch, Daily Motion, Mixer, and Instagram accounts, allowing customers to see estimated earnings and projects. The company offers an API allowing customers to integrate the Social Blade data directly into their own platforms. After BleepingComputer contacted Social Blade about the sale of their data, the company confirmed that they suffered a breach and began sending data breach notifications to customers. ""On December 14th we were notified of a potential data breach whereby an individual had acquired exports our users database and were attempting to sell it on a hacker forum,"" reads a data breach notification sent to customers. ""Samples were posted and we verified that they were indeed real. It appears this individual made use of of a vulnerability on our website to gain access to our database."" This data breach notification states that customers that a hacker managed to access the company’s database and steal the following information: The notice clarifies that no credit card information has been exposed due to this security incident. While Social Blade states that the user passwords were hashed using the bcrypt algorithm and cannot be easily deciphered, the company still suggests that all users reset their passwords. However, there won’t be a platform-wide reset of credentials. The authorization tokens for Business users and connected social media accounts have also been cycled, preventing threat actors from continuing to use the ones listed in the stolen database. In response to further questions about whether auth tokens were abused in this attack, SocialBlade sent BleepingComputer the following statement: ""As far as we know, no auth tokens were abused. For third party tokens they'd have become invalid typically within an hour after they're created in the first place and not be useable. Part of the leak included social blade business api users client id and tokens. These could have been used, but we have no indication that any were. The vast majority of them had no credits attached to them so trying to use them wouldn't work. For users who had paid for credits we informed them to let us know if they believe anyone has used their credits. So far no one has reported any issues. If a report does come in we'll investigate and credit them back any tokens used by an attacker."" - SocialBlade. BleepingComputer first learned of the data breach when a threat actor began selling the company's data on Monday, December 12th. In a forum post to the Breached hacking forum, a threat actor claimed that the data was stolen in September 2022 and was willing to sell it to a maximum of one to two people. The hacker claimed the stolen database held 5.6 million records and shared samples of the exfiltrated data, including IP addresses, emails, database structure, etc. BleepingComputer contacted Social Blade at the time to request a comment on the validity of the samples and got a confirmation that the data appeared authentic. The company says it has now addressed the security gap the intruder exploited to gain access to its systems and now performs additional checks to ensure that all systems are adequately hardened to prevent similar incidents in the future. “We are too aware that bad actors will continue to attempt to infiltrate IT infrastructure around the world, and rest assured we at Social Blade will never be complacent in hardening our security and defenses,” reads the notice. Social Blade urges users to remain vigilant against phishing attempts that typically accompany large-scale data breaches, impersonating the breached company to steal passwords and credit card numbers.

"Mercedes-Benz data breach exposes SSNs, credit card numbers",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mercedes-benz-data-breach-exposes-ssns-credit-card-numbers/,Ax Sharma,"June 25, 2021","Mercedes-Benz USA has just disclosed a data breach impacting some of its customers. The company assessed 1.6 million customer records which included customer names, addresses, emails, phone numbers, and some purchased vehicle information to determine the impact. It appears the data breach exposed credit card information, social security numbers, and driver license numbers of under 1,000 Mercedes-Benz customers and potential buyers. Yesterday, German automotive brand and luxury vehicle company, Mercedez-Benz disclosed a data breach impacting some customers and potential buyers. On June 11th, a Mercedes-Benz vendor informed the company that the personal information of select customers was exposed due to an insufficiently secured cloud storage instance. According to the company, the breach affects some customers and potential vehicle buyers who had entered sensitive information on Mercedez-Benz company and dealer websites between 2014 and 2017: ""It is our understanding the information was entered by customers and interested buyers on dealer and Mercedes-Benz websites between January 1, 2014 and June 19, 2017."" ""No Mercedes-Benz system was compromised as a result of this incident, and at this time, we have no evidence that any Mercedes-Benz files were maliciously misused."" ""Data security is a serious matter for MBUSA. Our vendor confirmed that the issue is corrected and that such an event cannot be replicated."" ""We will continue our investigation to ensure that this situation is properly addressed,"" said Mercedes-Benz in a press release . The vendor who notified Mercedez-Benz of the data breach states that the exposed information included: However, the company has stated that this information would not have been searchable on or indexed by a typical search engine. ""To view the information, one would need knowledge of special software programs and tools - an Internet search would not return any information contained in these files,"" says Mercedes-Benz. The company released this data breach statement after reviewing almost 1.6 million unique customer records , which included name, address, emails, phone numbers , and some purchased vehicle information. But, upon the completion of the investigation, it was determined that under 1,000 customers have had their ""additional"" personal information exposed via publicly accessible cloud storage solution. Mercedes-Benz USA says that it is in the process of contacting the affected individuals about this incident whose additional information was accessible. ""Any individual who had credit card information, a driver’s license number or a social security number included in the data will be offered complimentary 24-month subscription to a credit monitoring service. We will also notify the appropriate government agencies,"" says the vehicle company. Because the company mentions only under 1,000 customers had their additional information exposed, after auditing 1.6 million customer records, it is not clear exactly how many customers were affected by this incident. BleepingComputer has reached out to Mercedes-Benz/Daimler AG with additional questions and we are awaiting their response.

CafePress Data Breach Exposes Personal Info of 23 Million Users,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cafepress-data-breach-exposes-personal-info-of-23-million-users/,Lawrence Abrams,"August 5, 2019","CafePress, a well-known custom T-Shirt and merchandise site, suffered a data breach that exposed the personal information of 23 million of their customers. Users became aware of the breach today, not through CafePress, but through notifications from Troy Hunt's Have I Been Pwned service. After hearing about a CafePress data breach being circulated, Hunt solicited the help of security researcher Jim Scott who had helped him with other data breaches in the past, such as Evite . ""About 2 weeks ago I got notified by Troy that CafePress.com data breach was circulating and if I had seen it. At that time, the only public source of this data breach was from the data breach search engine WeLeakInfo and was not being sold as far as I know. With the help of my colleagues, I started to search for the database more thoroughly until I found it,"" Scott told BleepingComputer via email. Research by BleepingComputer shows that a dehashed CafePress database of approximately 493,000 accounts was being sold on hacker forums. It is not known if this is related to the same breach. According to HIBP, CafePress was hacked in February 2019 and exposed the personal information for 23,205,290 users. This exposed data includes Email addresses, Names, Passwords, Phone numbers, and Physical addresses. Scott further told BleepingComputer that half of the compromised user's passwords were encoded in base64 SHA1, which is a very weak algorithm by today's standards. The other half of the users contained third-party tokens for logins through Facebook and Amazon. ""It came to my attention that Troy forgot to add that passwords were also affected in this security incident when first announcing this data breach, which has now been corrected. Out of the 23 million compromised users, roughly half of them had their passwords exposed encoded in base64 SHA1, which is a very weak encryption method to use especially in 2019 when better alternatives are available. The remaining users who used CafePress through third-party applications, such as FaceBook or Amazon, had no compromised passwords."" At the time of this writing, CafePress has not responded to BleepingComputer's queries and has not issued a statement regarding the data breach. The only indication that something is wrong is that CafePress users are being forced to reset their password when they try to login to the site. In this password reset policy there is no mention of the breach as well. Companies need to do a better job at letting their users control their own data. If there is a data breach, it is necessary for the companies to disclose this information so that users can adequately protect themselves. Yet for the second time in a week, a company has decided that a password reset is their first step in disclosing a breach. First with StockX and now with CafePress. Password reset notifications must be done at the same time as breach notifications. Not before and not after. It's budget season!

"MOVEIt breach impacts Genworth, CalPERS as data for 3.2 million exposed",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/moveit-breach-impacts-genworth-calpers-as-data-for-32-million-exposed/,Bill Toulas,"June 23, 2023","PBI Research Services (PBI) has suffered a data breach with three clients disclosing that the data for 4.75 million people was stolen in the recent MOVEit Transfer data-theft attacks. These attacks started on May 27th , 2023, when the Clop ransomware gang began exploiting a MOVEit Transfer zero-day vulnerability to allegedly steal data from hundreds of companies. Over the past week, the Clop gang began extorting companies by slowly listing impacted organizations on its data leak site as they attempt to pressure victims to pay a ransom demand. According to three different disclosures from PBI clients, millions of customers have had their sensitive data exposed in these attacks. However, this number may increase as other companies make further disclosures. The first impacted entity is Genworth Financial, a Virginia-based life insurance services provider. In a MOVEit Security Event notice published on their website, Genworth says PBI informed them of the security breach on June 16, 2023, and subsequently verified that customers' personal data was stolen. The firm estimates that the data breach impacted between 2.5 and 2.7 million individuals who are either its customers (insurance, annuity, long-term care) or working for them as insurance agents. The exposed data includes the following: Genworth says this attack did not impact its own systems and network or affected its business operations, as it does not use the MOVEit or GoAnywhere products. Affected individuals will receive notices of a data breach in the coming weeks, which will contain instructions on enrolling for free-of-charge credit monitoring and identity theft protection services. The second firm impacted by the PBI breach is Wilton Reassurance, a New York-based insurance provider, which reports that 1,482,490 of its customers had data stolen. As reported to the Office of the Maine Attorney General, the exposed information includes customers' names and social security numbers. Although a sample of a data breach notification letter has not been uploaded to Maine's portal yet, Wilton Reassurance has informed that they will provide 12 months of free identity theft protection and credit monitoring services through Kroll to impacted individuals. The third company impacted by PBI's data breach is CalPERS (California Public Employees' Retirement System), the largest public pension fund in the US, which is now informing retirees and beneficiaries about the event. In a notice to its website, CalPERS says it responded to the situation immediately after learning about the breach and took actions to secure its members' benefits and data by strengthening its data management protocols that pertain to working with contractors. The agency says approximately 769,000 of its members were impacted by the security incident, who will all receive notification letters with detailed information on how to access two years of free credit monitoring service through Experian. At the time of writing this, PBI Research Services has not been listed on Clop's data leak site. While this could mean that the company is negotiating with the threat actors not to release data, it could also mean that Clop has not begun extorting the organization yet. BleepingComputer has contacted PBI to comment on the situation, but we have not heard back by publication. Update 6/24 - A PBI spokesperson has sent BleepingComputer the following comment: PBI Research Services uses Progress Software’s MOVEit file transfer application with a number of clients. At the end of May, Progress Software identified a zero-day vulnerability in the MOVEit software that was actively being exploited by cyber criminals. PBI promptly patched its instance of MOVEit, assembled a team of cybersecurity and privacy specialists, notified federal law enforcement and contacted potentially impacted clients. The cyber criminals did not gain access to PBI’s other systems – access was only gained to the MOVEit administrative portal subject to the vulnerability. PBI is working directly with impacted clients to identify impacted consumers and develop notice plans.

Following a January 3 attack that forced it to shut down some of its systems to contain the breach, the company told customers that recurring automatic payments would still be processed, with payment history delays. Payments via the servicing customer portal were also unavailable after the incident, and several other online portals, including MyloanDepot, HELOC, and the mellohome website, were also offline. Several days later, loanDepot confirmed this was a ransomware attack , with the malicious actors also encrypting files on compromised devices. Today, after confirming that millions of people had their data stolen, the company said it would notify individuals impacted by this data breach, providing them with free credit monitoring and identity protection services. ""The Company has made significant progress in restoring our loan origination and loan servicing systems, including our MyloanDepot and Servicing customer portals,"" loanDepot said. ""Although its investigation is ongoing, the Company has determined that an unauthorized third party gained access to sensitive personal information of approximately 16.6 million individuals in its systems."" Corporate and customer data stolen by ransomware gangs is now commonly used as leverage in double-extortion attacks to pressure victims into paying a ransom. Given that loanDepot stores sensitive customer financial and bank account information, those affected by this breach should know they might be the target of phishing attacks and identity theft attempts. However, loanDepot has yet to share what type of customer personal information was accessed and stolen from its systems. In May 2023, loanDepot disclosed another data breach resulting from an August 2022 cyberattack that exposed customer data. loanDepot is a major U.S. nonbank mortgage lender with roughly 6,000 employees and over $140 billion in serviced loans.

Gun exchange site confirms data breach after database posted online,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/gun-exchange-site-confirms-data-breach-after-database-posted-online/,Lawrence Abrams,"August 19, 2020","08/19 update added below. This post was originally published on August, 13th, 2020. A hacker has released the databases of Utah-based gun exchange, hunting, and kratom sites for free on a cybercrime forum. On August 10th, a threat actor posted databases that they claim contain 195,000 user records for the utahgunexchange.com, 45,000 records for their video site, 15,000 records from the hunting site muleyfreak.com, and 24,000 user records from the Kratom site deepjunglekratom.com. All of these sites are based out of Utah, USA and samples of the databases shared by cybersecurity intelligence firm Cyble show that each database was hosted on the same Amazon AWS server The latest date on user records in each database is July 16th, which indicates that is when the data was stolen. The exposed data is different on each site, but consists of email addresses, login names, and hashed passwords. We were able to confirm that many of the email addresses listed in the databases belong to registered users of the sites. While this does not provide 100% verification of posted data, it does lead us to believe that there was a breach of some kind. Update 8/19/20: After alerting the Utah Gun Exchange to their exposed data, today, they contacted BleepingComputer with a link to a data breach notification posted on their site. This notification confirms our report that a threat actor stole their database and that it consisted of user's email addresses, login names, and hashed passwords. UGE stressed that no financial information, including PayPal and credit card information, was exposed during this attack. Utah Gun Exchange's notification also implies that this attack was politically motivated. ""Utah Gun Exchange and UGETube remain dedicated to our mission of defending the First and Second Amendments and providing our users with a means to exercise their First and Second Amendment rights. As we know, there are many who have attacked, or will attack, Utah Gun Exchange and UGETube in an effort to stop us from accomplishing our mission to help protect your constitutional rights. We have recently learned of one such attack that affects you as our users,"" Utah Gun Exchange stated in their data breach notification . In our experience covering data breaches, it is more likely that the threat actor stumbled on their unsecured site and breached it without regard to the site's content. Utah Gun Exchange is asking all users to reset their passwords on utahgunexchange.com, and if they use the same passwords at other sites, to change them there as well. As the databases for muleyfreak.com and deepjunglekratom.com are also hosted on the same AWS server, it is strongly advised that you reset your passwords on these sites as well. As we said, it not confirmed that all of the exposed data is legitimate, but have confirmed that many of the emails listed in the databases are in use at the listed sites. Therefore, it is better to be safe than sorry and act under the assumption that your account credentials have been exposed. To be safe, if you are a user of one of these sites, it is strongly advised that you change your password immediately. If you use the same password at another site, you should also change the password to a unique and strong one that you only use for that site. Using unique passwords prevents a data breach at one site from affecting you at other websites you use. To assist you in keeping tracking of unique and strong passwords, it is suggested that you use a password manager application. Furthermore, as each site has a narrow scope of interest, it is important that all affected users be on the lookout for targeted phishing attacks abusing this data. To check if your information has been exposed, you can search for your email using the Am I Breached data breach monitoring service.

The affected individuals are primarily Casio employees and business partners, but there was a small set of customer personal information in the exposed data. The cyberattack occurred on October 5, when ransomware actors employing phishing tactics compromised the company's network and caused an IT systems outage . On October 10, the attack was claimed by the Underground ransomware gang, which threatened to disclose confidential documents, financial files, project information, and employee data unless a ransom was paid. Soon after, Casio confirmed that Underground had stolen the personal data of employees, partners, and customers. However, the company did not provide the number of affected people. With the investigation now completed, Casio is in a position to give the full details of the data breach scope. The latest announcement from the company lists the following exposed data: As impacted individuals are identified, they will receive personalized notices about the incident from Casio. Although some employees received unsolicited emails believed to be linked to the ransomware incident and sensitive data exposure, the company says there has been no secondary damage to them, their partners, or customers as of yet. Casio specified that no customer data or credit card information had been exposed to Underground ransomware, as their databases holding customer information were not impacted by this incident. The Japanese firm also made it clear that they did not negotiate with the cybercriminals. ""Following consultation with law enforcement agencies, outside counsel and security experts, Casio has not responded to any unreasonable demands from the ransomware group that carried out the unauthorized access,"" explains Casio .

National Student Clearinghouse data breach impacts 890 schools,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/national-student-clearinghouse-data-breach-impacts-890-schools/#comment_form,Sergiu Gatlan,"September 23, 2023","U.S. educational nonprofit National Student Clearinghouse (NSC) has disclosed a data breach affecting 890 schools using its services across the United States. In a breach notification letter filed with the Office of the California Attorney General, Clearinghouse said that attackers gained access to its MOVEit managed file transfer (MFT) server on May 30 and stole files containing a wide range of personal information. ""On May 31, 2023, the Clearinghouse was informed by our third-party software provider, Progress Software, of a cybersecurity issue involving the provider's MOVEit Transfer solution,"" NSC said. ""After learning of the issue, we promptly initiated an investigation with the support of leading cybersecurity experts. We have also coordinated with law enforcement."" The personally identifiable information (PII) contained in the stolen documents includes names, dates of birth, contact information, Social Security numbers, student ID numbers, and some school-related records (e.g., enrollment records, degree records, and course-level data). According to the data breach notification letters, the data exposed in the attack varies for each affected individual. The complete list of educational organizations affected by this massive data breach can be found here . NSC provides educational reporting, data exchange, verification, and research services to roughly 22,000 high schools and around 3,600 colleges and universities. The organization says its participants enroll roughly 97% of students in public and private institutions. In August, NSC revealed in a data breach filing with the Office of Maine’s attorney general that over 51,500 people were impacted in the incident. The Clop ransomware gang is responsible for the extensive data-theft attacks that started on May 27, leveraging a zero-day security flaw in the MOVEit Transfer secure file transfer platform. Starting June 15, the cyber criminals began extorting organizations that fell victim to the attacks, exposing their names on the group's dark web data leak site. The fallout from these attacks is anticipated to impact hundreds of organizations globally, with many already notifying affected customers over the past four months. Despite the widespread potential victim pool, estimates from Coveware suggest that only a limited number are likely to yield to Clop's ransom demands. Nonetheless, the cybercrime gang is expected to collect an estimated $75-100 million in payments due to the high ransom requests. Reports have also revealed that multiple U.S. federal agencies and two U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) entities have fallen prey to these data theft and extortion attacks. It's budget season!

Hackers blackmail Globe Life after stealing customer data,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-blackmail-globe-life-after-stealing-customer-data/,Bill Toulas,"October 17, 2024","Insurance giant Globe Life says an unknown threat actor attempted to extort money in exchange for not publishing data stolen from the company's systems earlier this year. Founded in 1900, Globe Life is among the largest providers of life and health insurance plans in the United States, with a market capitalization of $12 billion and a total revenue that exceeds $5.3 billion. Global Life previously disclosed a data breach on June 13 after discovering they had been compromised while reviewing potential vulnerabilities related to access permissions and user identity management for its web portal. At the time, the company warned that the hackers may have accessed consumer and policyholder data following a successful breach of one of the web portals. Although the company's operations weren't significantly disrupted due to the incident, there was concern about what data might have been stolen, as such a scenario could potentially impact millions. In a new filing submitted to the SEC today, Globe Life says that at least 5,000 customers of its subsidiary, American Income Life Insurance Company, are impacted. However, this number may increase as the investigation continues. Globe Life also says that the cybercriminals behind the attack attempted to extort the company into paying a ransom in exchange for not publishing the stolen data. The data samples the firm received from the threat actor appear to be related to one of its subsidiaries, American Income Life Insurance Company. ""Globe Life Inc. recently received communications from an unknown threat actor seeking to extort money from the Company in exchange for not disclosing certain information held and used by the Company and its independent agents,"" reads the Thursday morning SEC filing . ""Based on the Company's investigation to date, which remains ongoing, the Company believes that information relayed to the Company by the threat actor may relate to certain customers and customer leads that can be traced to the Company's subsidiary, American Income Life Insurance Company."" The information stolen by the cybercriminals includes the following data types, which vary per individual: full names, email addresses, phone numbers, postal addresses, Social Security Numbers, health-related data, and policy information. Global Life has also clarified that the extortion attempt does not involve ransomware, so there has been no data encryption of file locks on the company's systems. Regarding the financial impact of the incident, as of today, Global Life believes that it will not have a material impact on its business operations and does not expect it to affect its financials.

The attacker breached a subset of devices on its corporate network and gained access to what it describes as information collected from affected individuals and their employers. ""On December 30, 2022, Panasonic identified evidence of an issue potentially impacting certain systems in our corporate network environment that occurred on or around December 14, 2022,"" the company said in data breach notification letters filed with the Office of California's Attorney General last week. ""We promptly initiated a comprehensive investigation into the nature and scope of the incident and impacted personal information, engaging cybersecurity and forensics experts to assist in the investigation of the incident, to assess what information may have been impacted, and to identify the individuals associated with that information."" While some personal and health information was exposed during the incident, Panasonic has yet to find evidence that it was misused since the attack. Information impacted during the breach includes the affected individuals' names, contact details (email address, mailing address, and telephone number), dates of birth, medical and health insurance information, financial account numbers, company employment status, and government identifiers, such as Social Security numbers. Panasonic will provide 24 months of free identity and credit monitoring services through Kroll for all impacted people, warning them to check the reports for signs of suspicious activity.

EduCBA is an online education site based out of India that offers over 2,500 online courses and job oriented learning programs focus on finance, technology, and business to their 500,000 learners. Yesterday, EduCBA began emailing data breach notifications to customers stating that their systems were hacked and user data was exposed. The notification is a bit strange as it does not go into great detail about what information was stolen and simply states, ""email, name, password, courses visited, etc may have been compromised."" BleepingComputer has emailed EduCBA to clarify what other information is referenced by 'etc' but has not heard back as of yet. They have stated that no financial information was accessed as they use third-party processors such as PayPal and 2Checkout to process payments. As a precaution, EduCBA states that they have reset all user's passwords. ""Therefore, as a caution, we have invalidated passwords of all the users. You may retrieve your password here,"" the data breach notification reads. A comment on twitter, though, states that the password for their account was not reset. If you have an account at EduCBA, you should immediately change your password to a unique one only used at that site.

Data of 90K Mastercard Priceless Specials Members Shared Online,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/data-of-90k-mastercard-priceless-specials-members-shared-online/#comment_form,Sergiu Gatlan,"September 2, 2019","A database containing sensitive information of about 90,000 German Mastercard ""Priceless Specials"" loyalty program members shared online following a breach discovered on August 20 was added to data breach site Have I Been Pwned on September 1. The data was made available on the Internet after the breach, with customers' names, payment card numbers, partial credit card data, IP addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, gender, and dates of birth being included in the leaked info. Mastercard disclosed the data leak incident to the German and Belgian Data Protection Authorities (DPA) on August 23 and, on September 1, data breach site Have I Been Pwned added it to its own database. According to Have I Been Pwned the database dump contains the details of 89,338 German Mastercard customers with ""Priceless Specials"" bonus program accounts, with 46% of addresses part of this breach already having been added to the platform as part of previous database dumps. Have I Been Pwned subsequently notified all impacted users of the breach and is now also allowing the ones that don't have the alerts enabled to check if their e-mails are part of the leak incident on their own. Mastercard started an investigation immediately after learning of the data breach and requested all sites where the leaked customer information was hosted to delete all the personal info belonging to its Priceless Specials members. After discovering the data leak, Mastercard also suspended the German ""Priceless Specials"" bonus program and took down its website, leaving up only a message stating that the ""issue has no connection to MasterCard's payment network."" Juliane Schmitz-Engels, Mastercard's Head of Communications for Germany and Switzerland told BleepingComputer that the breach involving the Specials German loyalty platform managed by a third-party vendor, ""which resulted in the unauthorized distribution of certain information."" Mastercard said at the time that ""the incident is limited to the Specials program"" and that the only payment card information leaked in the incident were payment card numbers: Based on the facts known at this time, the following personal information is affected: payment card number, title, name, date of birth, gender, mailing address, e-mail address and telephone number and the time of first registration with Priceless Specials. Neither access data nor passwords were published. The expiration date of payment cards and the check digit (CVC) were also not published. Customers who want to check if their info has been exposed as part of this breach can enter their email address into https://haveibeenpwned.com/ to receive a report if their info has been found in any breaches added to the platform, including the Mastercard ""Priceless Specials"" one. Given that the database dump has already been shared online through several websites, the program's account credentials will most definitely be used in future credential stuffing attacks. Credential stuffing attacks allow attackers to use credentials compiled from data leaks originating from various companies' data breaches to attempt and gain access to accounts registered on other sites. These attacks work especially well to compromise the accounts of users who reuse the same password on all or several websites, therefore, the best way of avoiding getting your account hacked following a breach is to always use unique passwords for all your online accounts. If you use your Mastercard ""Priceless Specials"" password with accounts registered on other sites, you should immediately change the passwords at all sites that it is also used. By not doing so, you risk having those accounts compromised as well in the event of future attacks. It's budget season!

Google suffers data breach in ongoing Salesforce data theft attacks,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-suffers-data-breach-in-ongoing-salesforce-data-theft-attacks/,Lawrence Abrams,"August 6, 2025","Google is the latest company to suffer a data breach in an ongoing wave of Salesforce CRM data theft attacks conducted by the ShinyHunters extortion group. In June, Google warned that a threat actor they classify as 'UNC6040' is targeting companies' employees in voice phishing (vishing) social engineering attacks to breach Salesforce instances and download customer data. This data is then used to extort companies into paying a ransom to prevent the data from being leaked. In a brief update to the article last night, Google said that it too fell victim to the same attack in June after one of its Salesforce CRM instances was breached and customer data was stolen. ""In June, one of Google's corporate Salesforce instances was impacted by similar UNC6040 activity described in this post. Google responded to the activity, performed an impact analysis and began mitigations,"" reads Google's update . ""The instance was used to store contact information and related notes for small and medium businesses. Analysis revealed that data was retrieved by the threat actor during a small window of time before the access was cut off."" ""The data retrieved by the threat actor was confined to basic and largely publicly available business information, such as business names and contact details."" Google is classifying the threat actors behind these attacks as 'UNC6040' or 'UNC6240.' However, BleepingComputer, which has been tracking these attacks, has learned that a notorious threat actor known as ShinyHunters is behind the attacks . ShinyHunters has been around for years, responsible for a wide range of breaches, including those at PowerSchool , Oracle Cloud , the Snowflake data-theft attacks , AT&T , NitroPDF , Wattpad , MathWay , and many more . In a conversation with BleepingComputer yesterday, ShinyHunters claimed to have breached many Salesforce instances, with attacks still ongoing. The threat actor claimed yesterday to BleepingComputer that they breached a trillion-dollar company, and were considering just leaking the data rather than attempting to extort them. It is unclear if this company is Google. As for the other companies impacted in these attacks, the threat actor is extorting them through email, demanding they pay a ransom to prevent the data from being publicly leaked. Once the threat actor has finished privately extorting companies, they plan to publicly leak or sell data on a hacking forum. BleepingComputer has learned of one company that has already paid 4 Bitcoins, or approximately $400,000, to prevent the leak of their data. Other companies impacted in these attacks include Adidas , Qantas , Allianz Life , Cisco , and the LVMH subsidiaries Louis Vuitton , Dior , and Tiffany & Co.

New fake Ledger data breach emails try to steal crypto wallets,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-fake-ledger-data-breach-emails-try-to-steal-crypto-wallets/#comment_form,Lawrence Abrams,"December 17, 2024","A new Ledger phishing campaign is underway that pretends to be a data breach notification asking you to verify your recovery phrase, which is then stolen and used to steal your cryptocurrency. Ledger is a hardware cryptocurrency wallet that allows you to store, manage, and sell cryptocurrency. The funds in these wallets are secured using 24-word recovery phrases or 12 and 18-word phrases generated by other wallets. Anyone who knows your Ledger recovery phrase can use it to access the funds within the wallet. Therefore, recovery phrases must always be kept offline and never shared with anyone to prevent cryptocurrency funds from being stolen. Ledger has long been a target of phishing campaigns that attempt to steal users' recovery phrases or push fake Ledger Live software to steal information. These campaigns became significantly worse after Ledger suffered a data breach in 2020 that exposed its customers' names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses. However, over the past few days, multiple people have notified BleepingComputer or shared on X that they received a Ledger phishing email that pretends to be a new data breach notification. The phishing emails have the subject of ""Security Alert: Data Breach May Expose Your Recovery Phrase"" and appear to be from ""Ledger <support@ledger.com"". However, they are actually sent through the SendGrid email marketing platform. The phishing emails claim that Ledger suffered a data breach and that some recovery phrases have been exposed. The email then goes on to say that the user must verify their recovery phrase on Ledger's official verification page. ""We regret to inform you that a recent data breach has affected our service. While your Ledger wallet remains secure, there is a possibility that recovery phrases (also known as ""seed phrases"") linked to certain accounts have been exposed,"" reads the phishing email. ""To safeguard your assets, we strongly encourage you to verify the security of your recovery phrase through our secure verification tool."" Clicking the ""Verify My Recovery Phrase"" button brings you to an Amazon AWS website at ""https://product-ledg.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws[.]com/recover.html"" that then redirects users to a phishing page at ""ledger-recovery[.]info"". The ledger-recovery[.]info domain was registered on December 15th, 2024. This website pretends to be a Ledger site that asks you to perform a security check to see if your recovery phrase is compromised, as shown below. Clicking the ""Verify your Ledger now"" brings up another page asking you to enter your 12, 18, or 24-word Ledger recovery phrase. As you enter each word, the phishing page will check if the word is one of 2,048 valid words that can be entered as part of a recovery phrase. If a word not on the list is entered, it will be shown with a line through it. As you enter each word, the phishing page will send all of the entered recovery words to the site's backend to store them on the server. BleepingComputer was told that no matter what recovery phrase you enter, it will always state that it was invalid. It is believed this being done so that targets enter the phrase multiple times, allowing the phishing page to verify that the correct words are being entered. Other people have also shared other Ledger phishing emails sent out recently, including one that pretends to be a new firmware update. It, too, attempts to steal users' recovery phrases. Armed with the recovery phrase, the attackers can gain full access to your cryptocurrency funds and steal them. First and foremost, never enter your recovery phrase or secret passphrase in any app or website. Recovery phrases should only be entered directly on the Ledger device you are trying to recover. As it is easy to create lookalike domains that impersonate legitimate sites, when it comes to cryptocurrency and financial assets, always type the domain you're trying to reach into your browser rather than relying on links in emails. This way, you know you are going to ledger.com rather than a site impersonating it. Finally, disregard any emails claiming to be from Ledger stating that you were affected by a recent data breach or asking you to verify your recovery phrase. Ledger will never ask you for your recovery phrase, and as previously said, it should never be shared with anyone else.

PandaBuy pays ransom to hacker only to get extorted again,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/pandabuy-pays-ransom-to-hacker-only-to-get-extorted-again/,Bill Toulas,"June 6, 2024","Chinese shopping platform Pandabuy told BleepingComputer it previously paid a ransom demand to prevent stolen data from being leaked, only for the same threat actor to extort the company again this week. PandaBuy is an online platform that acts as an intermediary between customers and various Chinese e-commerce websites, including Tmall, Taobao, and JD.com, which don't ship internationally. The service allows users to purchase products from these websites, which are often cheaper or have unique items not available elsewhere, and have them shipped to their location. On March 31, 2024, a threat actor using the alias 'Sanggiero' published 3 million rows of data stolen from PandaBuy on BreachForums, exposing customer names, phone numbers, email addresses, login IP addresses, home addresses, and order details. The threat actor claimed they managed to steal that data by exploiting several critical vulnerabilities in the PandaBuy API. This data was shared with the data breach notification service Have I Been Pwned (HIBP), which added 1.35 million email addresses from this incident to its system. At the time, Pandabuy opted not to make any public statements, and there were even reports of the firm attempting to censor customer reports on Discord and Reddit. On June 3, 2024, the same threat actor offered to sell what he claimed was the entire database he previously stole from Pandabuy for $40,000. This database allegedly contains 17 million rows, indicating a much larger data set. Sanggiero did not provide evidence of additional customer data in the form of samples but uploaded screenshots showing sensitive employee information such as emails and passwords. A Pandabuy spokesperson admitted to BleepingComputer that they had paid the hacker an undisclosed amount to stop the data leak, adding that the threat actor may have shared the data with others, so they would no longer cooperate with him. "" At present, we cannot continue to pay the hacker fees due to the frozen funds, and the data he leaked is the same as the last one. We have confirmed with the technical department that all the loopholes have been fixed at the time of the first leak incident. And for all we know, he secretly sold our data to other agents after he made the deal with us. We can not cooperate with him in the future. "" BleepingComputer reached out to Sanggiero about the company's statement but has not heard back at this time. For now, it is better to take an abundance of caution and be on the lookout for unsolicited messages from people claiming to be Pandabuy, which may be a phishing attempt to gather additional personal nformation. If you have not previously reset your password at Pandabuy, it is strongly advised that you do so now, in case additional data was stolen, as the threat actor claims.

Startups disclose data breaches after massive 386M records leak,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/startups-disclose-data-breaches-after-massive-386m-records-leak/#comment_form,Lawrence Abrams,"July 30, 2020","Startups have begun to disclose data breaches after a massive leak of stolen databases was published on a hacker forum this month. This week, BleepingComputer was the first to report that ShinyHunters, a threat actor known for data breaches, began to leak the stolen databases of eighteen web sites for free on a hacker forum. Most of the companies targeted by these attacks appear to be startups, with the full list of the 18 data breaches and their updated disclosure status are listed below: ShinyHunters told BleepingComputer that they released the databases for free to benefit the ""community"" and as they already made enough money from selling them in private sales. Days after contacting these companies about the breaches, data breach disclosures have started to trickle in, with Drizly and Scentbird being the first ones. On July 27th, BleepingComputer contacted alcohol delivery startup Drizly regarding a database containing approximately 2.5 million records leaked for free on a hacker forum. This database, whose table is shown below, contained user's email, names, hashed passwords, addresses, phone numbers, and other information. A day after reporting the leak, Drizly told BleepingComputer that the breach was detected on July 13th, when an investigation was started. ""Drizly first identified that some customer data may have been impacted on July 13th and immediately began a forensic investigation with cyber security experts to understand what had happened and what information was impermissibly obtained. In addition, we quickly took steps to tighten security and further reduce risk of attack. In terms of scale, up to 2.5 million accounts have been affected. Delivery address was included in under 2% of the records. And as mentioned in our email to affected consumers, no financial information was compromised. Hashed passwords were taken, though we use BCrypt, an industry favored hashing algorithm, to encrypt the passwords. Because of the encryption Drizly accounts should not be able to be accessed, though to be cautious we’ve encouraged users to nonetheless change their passwords."" From their statement, Drizly does not appear to be requiring users to reset their passwords. As the exposed hashed passwords can potentially be decrypted, all Drizly users should immediately change their password at the site and at any other site that utilizes the same password. BleepingComputer also contacted fragrance subscription service Scentbird after their database was leaked for free by ShinyHunters. This database contains users' email, name, hashed password, birthday, gender, whether they are influencers, and other customer information. BleepingComputer did not receive a response to our inquiry, but in a notification seen by BleepingComputer, Scentbird has disclosed the data breach. ""We are writing to let you know that Scentbird recently learned that unauthorized individuals may have accessed a database containing the personal information of Scentbird’s users. We launched an investigation as soon as we became aware of this incident, and our investigation is in its initial stages. We wanted to notify you right away, however, so that you can take action to protect yourself."" ""We have no reason to believe that the incident affected social security numbers, government-issued ID numbers, or full credit or debit card numbers. We do not maintain this type of information about users. Depending on the type of account you maintained, the affected information may have included your name, email address, encrypted Scentbird account password, billing and shipping address, date of birth (if you chose to provide this information), and gender,"" Scentbird disclosed. Scentbird states that they are performing a mandatory password reset for all users when they next log into the site. Like Drizly, if your Scentbird password is used at other sites, you should immediately change the password at these sites so that your accounts are not breached.

"Hacker sells stolen Starbucks data of 219,000 Singapore customers",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacker-sells-stolen-starbucks-data-of-219-000-singapore-customers/,Bill Toulas,"September 16, 2022","The Singapore division of Starbucks, the popular American coffeehouse chain, has admitted that it suffered a data breach incident impacting over 219,000 of its customers. The first clue that they were breached came on September 10, when a threat actor offered to sell a database containing sensitive details of 219,675 Starbucks customers on a popular hacking forum. The hacking forum's owner, ""pompompurin,"" joined the discussion to back the validity of the stolen data, saying that the provided samples contain substantial proof of authenticity. Today, Starbucks Singapore sent out letters to notify its customers of a data breach, explaining that hackers may have stolen the following details: This breach concerns only customers who have used the Starbucks mobile app to make orders or used the chain's online store to purchase goods from one of the 125 shops the chain operates in Singapore. This point was further clarified by a Starbucks spokesperson to local media outlets , where the data breach was confirmed again. Additionally, the company said that no financial details, such as credit card information, have been compromised, as Starbucks does not store the data. Even though account passwords, Rewards membership, or credits aren't considered impacted, Starbucks Singapore urges customers to reset their passwords and remain vigilant against suspicious communications. The data seller on the hacking forums claims to have already sold one copy of the stolen data for $3,500 and is willing to offer at least four more copies to interested buyers. The reason for this limitation is to artificially keep the value of the offered data high, as selling it to many threat actors would diminish the value as multiple attacks are launched simultaneously. This approach raises the risk of Starbucks Singapore customers becoming targets of phishing attacks, social engineering, and scamming. It is also worth noting that the hacker initially offered access to the compromised admin panel for $25,000, enabling intruders to fabricate promo codes, change membership tiers, and more. However, access to the admin panel was lost at some point, so that offer has been retracted, and the sale is now limited to the database contents. Update 9/17/2022: A Starbucks spokesperson has sent BleepingComputer the following comment: We are aware of the unauthorized activity impacting a select number of customer accounts in Singapore and are working with our licensed operator in the market to protect customer information. Like all major retailers, Starbucks has safeguards in place to constantly monitor for fraudulent activity, which in this case, enabled early detection of the unauthorized activity. Customers are encouraged to use different usernames and passwords for different sites, especially those that keep financial information, to protect their data security.

"WeLeakInfo.com Seized For Selling Info from Data Breaches, 2 Arrested",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/weleakinfocom-seized-for-selling-info-from-data-breaches-2-arrested/,Lawrence Abrams,"January 16, 2020","As a clear indication of how law enforcement views the commercial disclosure of stolen information, the FBI has seized the WeLeakInfo.com domain and international law enforcement arrested two individuals for selling subscriptions to data exposed in breaches. These accessed credentials were then used to conduct attacks in the UK, Germany, and the US. In coordination with the UK NCA, the Netherlands National Police Corps, the German Bundeskriminalamt, and the Police Service of Northern Ireland. the FBI took ownership of the WeLeakInfo.com domain name and added a notice stating it was seized. According to a U.S. Department of Justice announcement , the domain was seized for offering subscriptions that allowed subscribers to search for specific information exposed in data breaches. ""The website had claimed to provide its users a search engine to review and obtain the personal information illegally obtained in over 10,000 data breaches containing over 12 billion indexed records – including, for example, names, email addresses, usernames, phone numbers, and passwords for online accounts. The website sold subscriptions so that any user could access the results of these data breaches, with subscriptions providing unlimited searches and access during the subscription period (one day, one week, one month, or three months)."" As part of this operation, two individuals were arrested in the Netherlands and Ireland who are suspected to be involved in the site and are believed to have made £200,000 from its operation. Online payments traced back to these individual's IP addresses indicate that they may be heavily involved in the site's operation. The UK's NCA states that they have established links between We Leak Info and the purchase of further malware such as RATs and Cryptors. ""Law enforcement activity in the UK last year established links between the purchase of cyber crime tools, such as remote access Trojans (RATs) and cryptors, and weleakinfo.com."" We Leak Info claimed to have compiled almost 12.5 billion records stolen from data breaches and allowed users to pay to access it. To access this data, visitors could subscribe to various plans ranging from a $2 trial to a $70 three-month unlimited access account. These plans would then allow a user to perform searches that retrieve information exposed in these data breaches. The actual disclosure of the stolen data compared to just allowing users to be notified if their info was exposed is a clear distinction between how We Leak Info and a service like HaveIBeenPwned utilize data breaches. In We Leak Info's case, threat actors commonly subscribed to search for exposed usernames and passwords and then used that info to perform credential stuffing attacks, phishing attacks, and potentially network breaches. On the other hand, HaveIBeenPwned will just tell you if an entered email is part of a data breach, but does not provide any other information. When the news that weleakinfo.com was seized, people were not sure if this was a prank being conducted by the owners or an actual seizure by law enforcement. To illustrate this confusion, a poll on Twitter showed that 70% of the 492 respondents felt that this was a joke. At the time, even We Leak Info indicated that they had no idea what was going on and tweeted that they ""are currently investigating this issue."" With the press releases from law enforcement, we now have a clear picture that this was not a joke and that their operation has been shut down.

PowerSchool starts notifying victims of massive data breach,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/powerschool-starts-notifying-victims-of-massive-data-breach/,Bill Toulas,"January 28, 2025","Education software giant PowerSchool has started notifying individuals in the U.S. and Canada whose personal data was exposed in a late December 2024 cyberattack. Though this is a step forward, the company has still not officially disclosed the exact number of individuals impacted by the security incident. Moreover, a detailed report on what exactly has happened, expected by CrowdStrike, who is involved in the investigations, continues to be overdue. PowerSchool is a cloud-based K-12 software provider serving over 60 million students and 18,000 customers worldwide, offering enrollment, communication, attendance, staff management, learning, analytics, and finance solutions. In December, the company suffered a breach where attackers gained unauthorized access to one of its customer support portals, PowerSource, and stole sensitive data from 6,505 school districts. The stolen data includes varying types of information per district, including full names, physical addresses, contact information, Social Security numbers (SSNs), medical data, and grades. Although the company alleged that the incident only impacted a subset of customers, a threat actor claimed in their extortion demand that they stole data of 62,488,628 students and 9,506,624 teachers, indicating the scope of the breach was all but limited. In an update published on the PowerSchool website yesterday, the company says it has started notifying individuals affected by the data breach. This includes current and former students, if applicable, their parents and guardians, and also educators in the U.S., Canada, and abroad. ""PowerSchool began the process of filing regulatory notifications with Attorneys General Offices across applicable U.S. jurisdictions on behalf of impacted customers who have not opted-out of our offer to do so,"" reads the status update . ""PowerSchool has also started the process of notifying Canadian regulators. We will provide a separate update to our international customers later this week."" PowerSchool has already shared a sample notification with Maine's Attorney General's office, which states that 33,488 people were impacted in that state. However, it does not include the total number of affected people. Depending on the school district, the data breach notifications will alert individuals if their Social Security Numbers and medical information were stolen, which does not appear to be the case for Maine residents. The company offers impacted students and teachers free two-year identity theft protection services and credit monitoring for adults.

According to the company's data breach notification, North Country first observed that suspicious activity was present on some of its clients' networks on January 4 and a joint investigation with a third-party cybersecurity forensic firm established that the cause was malware deployed on its partner restaurants' networks. As detailed in the notification breach hosted at ncbpdataevent.com : On January 30, 2019, the investigation determined that an unauthorized party was able to deploy malware to certain of North Country’s business partners restaurants between January 3, 2019, and January 24, 2019, that collected credit and debit card information. North Country also said that the bad actors who deployed the malware were potentially able to gain access to ""the cardholder’s name, credit card number, expiration date, and CVV."" The North Country’s business partners whose customers were likely affected by this data breach are listed within the data breach notification, and it comprises 137 different restaurants from roughly a dozen U.S. states.

Amazon confirms employee data breach after vendor hack,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/amazon-confirms-employee-data-breach-after-vendor-hack/#comment_form,Sergiu Gatlan,"November 11, 2024","Amazon confirmed a data breach involving employee information after data allegedly stolen during the May 2023 MOVEit attacks was leaked on a hacking forum. The threat actor behind this data leak, known as Nam3L3ss, published over 2.8 million lines of Amazon employee data, including names, contact information, building locations, email addresses, and more. Amazon spokesperson Adam Montgomery confirmed Nam3L3ss' claims, adding that this data was stolen from systems belonging to a third-party service provider. ""Amazon and AWS systems remain secure, and we have not experienced a security event. We were notified about a security event at one of our property management vendors that impacted several of its customers including Amazon,"" Montgomery said. ""The only Amazon information involved was employee work contact information, for example work email addresses, desk phone numbers, and building locations."" The company said the breached vendor only had access to employee contact information, and the attackers didn't access or steal sensitive employee information like Social Security numbers, government identification, or financial information. Amazon added that the vendor has since patched the security vulnerability used in the attack. Nam3L3ss has also leaked the data from twenty-five other companies. However, they say some of the data was obtained from other sources, including ransom gangs' leak sites and exposed AWS and Azure buckers. ""I download entire databases from exposed web sources including mysql, postgres, SQL Server databases and backups, azure databases and backups etc and then convert them to csv or other format,"" they said. ""DO NOT ask me for access to my storage etc, at present I have well over 250TB of archived database files etc."" The list of companies whose data was stolen in MOVEit attacks or harvested from Internet-exposed resources and has now been leaked on the hacking forum includes Lenovo, HP, TIAA, Schwab, HSBC, Delta, McDonald's, and Metlife, among others (as shown in the table below). BleepingComputer has contacted multiple companies and will update this article when additional information is available. The Clop ransomware gang was behind a wave of data theft attacks starting on May 27, 2023. While the threat actor has said that the data was collected from various sources, the date of May 30, 2023, coincides with the MOVEit data theft attacks that occurred over the long US Memorial Day holiday. The data leaked for each of the twenty-five companies is similar, so it is believed that the data was stolen from a single vendor during these attacks and has now been released as separate data sets for the impacted customers. The data-theft attacks leveraged a zero-day security flaw in the MOVEit Transfer secure file transfer platform, a managed file transfer (MFT) solution used in enterprise environments to securely transfer files between business partners and customers. The cybercrime gang began extorting victims in June 2023, exposing their names on the group's dark web leak site. The fallout from these attacks impacted hundreds of organizations worldwide, with tens of millions of people having their data stolen and used in extortion schemes or leaked online since then Multiple U.S. federal agencies and two U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) entities have also been targeted and breached in these attacks As MCP (Model Context Protocol) becomes the standard for connecting LLMs to tools and data, security teams are moving fast to keep these new services safe.

During the subsequent investigation, the firm discovered that the perpetrators had access to ILS systems between June 30 and July 5, 2022, and had access to the data during that time. “Through its response efforts, ILS learned that an unauthorized actor obtained access to certain ILS systems between June 30 and July 5, 2022,” reads the data breach notice . “During that period, some information stored on the ILS network was acquired by the unauthorized actor, and other information was accessible and potentially viewed.” In that period, the threat actors might have accessed the personal information of patients, including: Threat actors could use this information to launch phishing or social engineering attacks against the exposed individuals, and it severely impacts the privacy of affected patients. ILS claims its internal review determining which individuals or entities were impacted was completed on January 17, 2023, over six months after the breach's discovery. However, the firm clarifies that some affected individuals were informed about the incident on September 2, 2022, based on preliminary results.

In a data breach notification today, the company explained that hackers used stolen account credentials and accessed the Rewards platform multiple times, potentially stealing customer data, too. “We recently identified suspicious login activity to certain Hot Topic Rewards accounts,” reads the notice . “Following a careful investigation, we determined that unauthorized parties launched automated attacks against our website and mobile application on February 7, March 11, May 19-21, May 27-28, and June 18-21, 2023, using valid account credentials obtained from an unknown third-party source.” The company says that the investigation determined that Hot Topic was not the source of the credentials but it could also not find the source. As part of the security measures implemented after the attacks, Hot Topic added ""specific steps to safeguard our website and mobile application from"" credential-stuffing attacks. “Credential stuffing” is a type of cyberattack that relies on users employing the same credentials on multiple online services. When a leak or data breach occurs, threat actors typically test those username and password pairs on various online services, hoping they get a successful login. Hot Topic said that it could not discern between unauthorized and legitimate logins. As a result, it will notify all customers that had their accounts accessed during the cyberattacks. The information that may have been exposed to hackers includes: The company has clarified that malicious access or exfiltration of the above information has not yet been verified, but it is notifying potentially breached account holders out of an abundance of caution.

According to a letter sample shared with the Office of the Vermont Attorney General, the attacks did not result from a breach on the company but from account compromise on other platforms. ""Our own systems were not compromised. However, we strongly believe that an unauthorized third party knows and has utilized your username and password for your account,"" NortonLifeLock said . ""This username and password combination may potentially also be known to others."" More specifically, the notice explains that around December 1, 2022, an attacker used username and password pairs they bought from the dark web to attempt to log in to Norton customer accounts. The firm detected ""an unusually large volume"" of failed login attempts on December 12, 2022, indicating credential stuffing attacks where threat actors try out credentials in bulk. By December 22, 2022, the company had completed its internal investigation, which revealed that the credential stuffing attacks had successfully compromised an undisclosed number of customer accounts. In accessing your account with your username and password, the unauthorized third party may have viewed your first name, last name, phone number, and mailing address — NortonLifeLock For customers utilizing the Norton Password Manager feature, the notice warns that the attackers might have obtained details stored in the private vaults. Depending on what users store in their accounts, this could lead to the compromise of other online accounts, loss of digital assets, exposure of secrets, and more. NortonLifeLock underlines that the risk is especially large for those who use similar Norton account passwords and Password Manager master keys, allowing the attackers to pivot more easily. The company says it has reset Norton passwords on impacted accounts to prevent attackers from gaining access to them again in the future and also implemented additional measures to counter the malicious attempts. NortonLifeLock also advises customers to enable two-factor authentication to protect their accounts and take up the offer for a credit monitoring service. The company is yet to disclose the exact number of people impacted by this incident. BleepingComputer has reached out to NortonLifeLock, and we'll update this post as soon as we hear back.

Some of the impacted people are customers at large insurance companies such as The Hartford, Transamerica, and Gerber Life Insurance. WebTPA is a GuideWell Mutual Holding Corporation subsidiary and a third-party administrator (TPA) that provides customized administrative services to health plans and insurance companies. It employs 18,000 people and generates $103 million in annual revenue. The breach happened last year but it was discovered last December, when the company found evidence of suspicious activity on its network. A recent update on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services data breach portal shows that the number of affected individuals is 2,429,175. According to the notification on WebTPA's website, the threat actor had access to personal data for five days, between April 18 and April 23, 2023. However, WebTPA discovered the breach only in late December and immediately launched an investigation. “On December 28, 2023, we detected evidence of suspicious activity on the WebTPA network that prompted us to launch an investigation,” reads the announcement . “The investigation concluded that the unauthorized actor may have obtained personal information between April 18 and April 23, 2023,” WebTPA notes. WebTPA informed benefit plan providers and insurance companies of the data breach on March 25, 2024. The company sent notices to affected individuals on May 8, 2024, informing that the following types of data had been exposed: The investigation revealed that financial account information, credit card numbers, medical treatment, and diagnostic information have not been exposed to unauthorized access. Multiple health plan and insurance organizations have published notifications saying that the WebTPA data breach has impacted some of their customers. Among the companies with customers affected by the WebTPA breach are Dean Health Plan , APA Voluntary Supplemental Medical Plan , The Hartford (Critical Illness, Hospital Indemnity, Accident, Medicare Supplement and Tricare products), Transamerica , and Gerber Life Insurance. In the data breach notification, WebTPA has included instructions on how to enroll for two years of credit monitoring, identity theft protection, and fraud consultation services through Kroll, which is possible until August 1st. Although WebTPA says it’s not aware of any cases of misuse of the exposed data, affected individuals should remain vigilant for communications from potential fraudsters and refrain from sharing any personal or financial information in such cases. It is also advisable to review credit reports carefully and consider placing a security freeze on credit files to mitigate fraud risks. It's budget season!

The incident occurred on May 12, 2025, and was caused by a threat actor logging into the TxDOT systems using compromised credentials. ""On May 12, 2025, TxDOT identified unusual activity in its Crash Records Information System (CRIS),"" reads the TxDOT announcement . ""Further investigation revealed the activity originated from an account that was compromised and used to improperly access and download nearly 300,000 crash reports. TxDOT immediately disabled access from the compromised account."" The data that may have been exposed in these crash records includes: The exposure of this data elevates the risk for social engineering, scamming, and phishing attacks for impacted individuals, the total number of which has not been disclosed yet. TxDOT has started distributing data breach notifications to affected individuals, urging them to increase their vigilance against potential targeted attacks using the stolen information. No identity theft protection or credit monitoring service coverage was offered to the letter recipients, but a dedicated support line was set up for their assistance. It is also recommended that impacted individuals monitor their credit reports for suspicious activity and consider freezing their credit to avoid damages from fraud. In the meantime, the agency assures the public it has blocked the attacker's unauthorized access to the compromised account and is implementing additional security measures. BleepingComputer has contacted the Texas Department of Transportation to learn more about the type of attack and how many people it impacted, and we will update this post when we receive a response.

MailChimp discloses new breach after employees got hacked,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mailchimp-discloses-new-breach-after-employees-got-hacked/#comment_form,Lawrence Abrams,"January 18, 2023","Email marketing firm MailChimp suffered another breach after hackers accessed an internal customer support and account administration tool, allowing the threat actors to access the data of 133 customers. MailChimp says the attackers gained access to employee credentials after conducting a social engineering attack on Mailchimp employees and contractors. The attack was first detected on January 11th, after MailChimp detected the unauthorized person accessing their support tools. ""After we identified evidence of an unauthorized actor, we temporarily suspended account access for Mailchimp accounts where we detected suspicious activity to protect our users’ data,"" reads a statement about the security incident. ""We notified the primary contacts for all affected accounts on January 12, less than 24 hours after initial discovery."" In response to our questions about the breach, MailChimp shared the following statement. ""While we do not share customer information as a matter of course, we can share that no credit card or password information was compromised as a result of this incident,"" MailChimp told BleepingComputer. ""Our investigation into the matter is ongoing, and includes identifying measures to further protect our platform. For operational security reasons we are not publicly commenting on actions we are taking. - MailChimp. As first reported by TechCrunch , one of the customers affected by this breach is the massively popular WooCommerce eCommerce plugin for WordPress. WooCommerce has emailed customers warning them that the MailChimp breach exposed their names, store URLs, addresses, and email addresses. #Woocommerce Users receive this from a noreply email address as an information of a data #breach at #Mailchimp . #privacy #malware #dataprotection #itsecurity pic.twitter.com/O9AmA2cyBu While WooCommerce states that there is no indication that the stolen data has been misused, threat actors commonly use this type of data for targeted phishing attacks to steal credentials or install malware. In April 2022, Trezor hardware wallet owners began receiving fake data breach notifications prompting customers to download a fake Trezor Suite software that would steal their recovery seeds. Trezor said on Twitter that the mailing list used in this phishing campaign was a Trezor mailing list stolen in a breach on MailChimp. MailChimp later confirmed that the breach was more extensive , with employees falling for a social engineering attack that allowed threat actors to access 319 MailChimp accounts and export the data from 102 customers. The marketing company confirmed that this data was being used in phishing emails but declined to share more information about the attacks. In August 2022, MailChimp was again breached after employees fell for an Okta phishing attack dubbed '0ktapus.' MailChimp told BleepingComputer at the time that the threat actors accessed 214 MailChimp accounts , focusing on cryptocurrency-related customers. Customers affected in the August breach included Edge Wallet, Cointelegraph, NFT creators, Ethereum FESP, and Messari and Decrypt.

The notification warns that the hacker gained unauthorized access to Pizza Hut Australia systems storing sensitive info for customers who made online orders, as well as partial financial data and encrypted account passwords. ""We became aware in early September of a cyber security incident where an unauthorized third party accessed some of the company's data,"" reads the notice sent to customers. ""We have confirmed that the data impacted relates to customer record details and online order transactions held on our Pizza Hut Australia customer database."" The information that has been exposed to the network intruders includes the following: The restaurant chain, which operates in 260 locations in Australia, says recipients of its notices ""may wish to consider"" updating their password despite being ""one-way encrypted"" in the database. Moreover, the notice urges customers to stay vigilant for phishing attacks and suspicious links sent to them via unsolicited communications. Ultimately, Pizza Hut says the incident only impacts a small number of its customers, and the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) has been fully informed about the situation. The exact number of impacted customers was disclosed via a statement from a Pizza Hut spokesperson to The Guardian , stating that the incident affected 193,000 people. At the start of September 2023, DataBreaches reported that the notorious data broker 'ShinyHunters' made claims about stealing the data of 1 million customers of Pizza Hut Australia. The threat actor alleged they gained access via an unprotected Amazon Web Services (AWS) endpoint between July and August 2023, accessing a database with 30 million orders. Pizza Hut Australia never responded to these allegations, so it is unclear whether the two incidents are in any way related. Earlier this year, in January 2023, the owner of Pizza Hut, Yum! Brands, was targeted by a ransomware attack that forced the closure of three hundred locations in the United Kingdom. In April 2023, the firm confirmed that the threat actors had stolen employee information from its networks, albeit it found no evidence that customers were affected by the data breach.

"ShinyHunters behind Salesforce data theft attacks at Qantas, Allianz Life, and LVMH",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/shinyhunters-behind-salesforce-data-theft-attacks-at-qantas-allianz-life-and-lvmh/,Lawrence Abrams,"July 30, 2025","A wave of data breaches impacting companies like Qantas, Allianz Life, LVMH, and Adidas has been linked to the ShinyHunters extortion group, which has been using voice phishing attacks to steal data from Salesforce CRM instances. In June, Google's Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) warned that threat actors tracked as UNC6040 were targeting Salesforce customers in social engineering attacks . In these attacks, the threat actors impersonated IT support staff in phone calls to targeted employees, attempting to persuade them into visiting Salesforce's connected app setup page. On this page, they were told to enter a ""connection code"", which linked a malicious version of Salesforce's Data Loader OAuth app to the target's Salesforce environment. In some cases, the Data Loader component was renamed to ""My Ticket Portal,"" to make it more convincing in the attacks. GTIG says that these attacks were usually conducted through vishing (voice phishing), but credentials and MFA tokens were also stolen through phishing pages that impersonated Okta login pages. Around the time of this report, multiple companies reported data breaches involving third-party customer service or cloud-based CRM systems. LVMH subsidiaries Louis Vuitton , Dior , and Tiffany & Co. each disclosed unauthorized access to a customer information database, with Tiffany Korea notifying customers the attackers breached a ""vendor platform used for managing customer data."" Adidas , Qantas , and Allianz Life also reported breaches involving third-party systems, with Allianz confirming it was a third-party customer relationship management platform. ""On July 16, 2025, a malicious threat actor gained access to a third-party, cloud-based CRM system used by Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America (Allianz Life),"" an Allianz Life spokesperson told BleepingComputer. While BleepingComputer has learned that the Qantas data breach also involved a third-party customer relationship management platform, the company will not confirm it is Salesforce. However, previous reporting from local media claims the data was stolen from Qantas' Salesforce instance. Furthermore, court documents state that the threat actors targeted "" Accounts "" and "" Contacts "" database tables, both of which are Salesforce objects. While none of these companies have publicly named Salesforce, BleepingComputer has since confirmed that all were targeted in the same campaign detailed by Google. The attacks have not led to public extortion or data leaks yet, with BleepingComputer learning that the threat actors are attempting to privately extort companies over email, where they name themselves as ShinyHunters. It is believed that when these extortion attempts fail, the threat actors will release stolen information in a long wave of leaks, similar to ShinyHunter's previous Snowflake attacks . ""We have not identified any data leak sites associated with this activity,"" Genevieve Stark, Head of Cybercrime, and Information Operations Intelligence Analysis at GTIG, told BleepingComputer. ""It is plausible that the threat actor intends to sell the data instead of sharing it publicly. This approach would align with prior ShinyHunters Group activity."" Google say they are now tracking Salesforce data-theft attacks under multiple threat group designations. ""GTIG attributes multiple incidents impacting Salesforce instances to UNC6040. In at least some cases, the follow-on extortion activity, which we attribute to the distinct threat cluster UNC6240, has used the ShinyHunters brand,"" Stark told BleepingComputer. ""The extortion activity is attributed to UNC6240 instead of UNC6040 due to a significant time gap between the initial data theft activity and the subsequent extortion activity. We have not confirmed the nature of the relationship between these intrusions and the prior use of this handle on underground forums."" The breaches have caused confusion among the cybersecurity community and the media, including BleepingComputer, with the attacks attributed to Scattered Spider (tracked by Mandiant as UNC3944), as those threat actors were also targeting the aviation , retail , and insurance sectors around the same time and demonstrated similar tactics. However, threat actors associated with Scattered Spider tend to perform full-blown network breaches, culminating with data theft and, sometimes, ransomware. ShinyHunters, tracked as UNC6040, on the other hand, tends to focus more on data-theft extortion attacks targeting a particular cloud platform or web application. It is BleepingComputer's and some security researchers' belief that both UNC6040/UNC6240 and UNC3944 consist of overlapping members that communicate within the same online communities. The threat group is also believed to overlap with ""The Com,"" a network of experienced English-speaking cybercriminals. ""According to Recorded Future intelligence, the overlapping TTPs between known Scattered Spider and ShinyHunters attacks indicate likely some crossover between the two groups,"" Allan Liska, an Intelligence Analyst for Recorded Future, told BleepingComputer. Other researchers have told BleepingComputer that ShinyHunters and Scattered Spider appear to be operating in lockstep, targeting the same industries at the same time, making it harder to attribute attacks. Some also believe that both groups have ties to threat actors from the now-defunct Lapsus$ hacking group , with reports indicating that one of the recently arrested Scattered Spider hackers was also in Lapsus$ . Another theory is that ShinyHunters is acting as an extortion-as-a-service, where they extort companies on behalf of other threat actors in exchange for a revenue share, similar to how ransomware-as-a-service gangs operate. This theory is supported by previous conversations BleepingComputer has had with ShinyHunters, where they claimed not to be behind a breach, but just acting as the seller of the stolen data. These breaches include PowerSchool , Oracle Cloud , the Snowflake data-theft attacks , AT&T , NitroPDF , Wattpad , MathWay , and many more . To muddy the waters further, there have been numerous arrests of people linked to the name ""ShinyHunters,"" including those who have been arrested for the Snowflake data-theft attacks , breaches at PowerSchool , and the operation of the Breached v2 hacking forum . Yet even after these arrests, new attacks occur with companies receiving extortion emails stating, ""We are ShinyHunters,"" referring to themselves as a ""collective."" In a statement to BleepingComputer, Salesforce emphasized that the platform itself was not compromised, but rather, customers' accounts are being breached via social engineering. ""Salesforce has not been compromised, and the issues described are not due to any known vulnerability in our platform. While Salesforce builds enterprise-grade security into everything we do, customers also play a critical role in keeping their data safe — especially amid a rise in sophisticated phishing and social engineering attacks,"" Salesforce told BleepingComputer. ""We continue to encourage all customers to follow security best practices, including enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA), enforcing the principle of least privilege, and carefully managing connected applications.

Optus hacker apologizes and allegedly deletes all stolen data,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/optus-hacker-apologizes-and-allegedly-deletes-all-stolen-data/,Bill Toulas,"September 27, 2022","The hacker who claimed to have breached Optus and stolen the data of 11 million customers has withdrawn their extortion demands after facing increased attention by law enforcement. The threat actor also apologized to 10,200 people whose personal data was already leaked on a hacking forum. Optus, Australia's second-largest mobile operator, first disclosed the security breach on September 22, 2022, saying that an attacker might have gained access to customers' personal information. This information includes a customer's name, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, physical addresses, driver's licenses, and passport numbers, but no account passwords or financial information. On September 23, 2022, a hacker using the alias ""optusdata"" published a small sample of the stolen data on the Breached hacking forum and demanded that the firm pay a $1,000,000 (USD) ransom or the data for 11,000,000 customers would be publicly leaked. Optus didn't give in to the extortion demands and instead engaged with law enforcement authorities to investigate the incident. The hacker told reporter Jeremy Kirk that they used an unsecured API endpoint to steal the data rather than breaching the company's internal systems. After not receiving a ransom demand, the threat actor released a larger sample of stolen data for 10,000 Optus customers for free on the same hacking forum, allowing threat actors to download and abuse it for their own campaigns. Today, reports from victims of the data breach have started to receive messages demanding the payment of AUD 2,000 ($1,300) within two days, or their data would be sold to other hackers. The threat actor listed a Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) account to receive the money, which the financial institution has since blocked . While the texts include the name 'OptusData' used by the original hacker, it is unclear if they are behind the SMS texts or another threat actor who downloaded the leaked data sample. Today, the alleged Optus hacker posted a new message on Breached stating that the stolen data will no longer be sold or leaked to anyone due to increased scrutiny on the data breach. The threat actor also claimed that the stolen data had been deleted from their device that held the only copy and apologized to both the exposed Optus customers and the company. ""Too many eyes. We will not sale data to anyone. We can't if we even want to: personally deleted data from drive (only copy),"" claims the threat actor. It's worth noting that the particular user was never officially confirmed as the person or group responsible for the Optus breach. However, the decision to stop extorting the company likely comes in response to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) announcing yesterday that they launched ""Operation Hurricane"" to identify the threat actors behind the breach and extortion demands. ""We are aware of reports of stolen data being sold on the dark web and that is why the AFP is monitoring the dark web using a range of specialist capabilities,"" announced the AFP. ""Criminals, who use pseudonyms and anonymising technology, can’t see us but I can tell you that we can see them."" As part of this operation, the AFP is working closely with overseas law enforcement to identify and apprehend those behind the attack. Should AFP identify the person(s) responsible for the Optus breach, they will face penalties of up to ten years in prison. Optus continues to update its customers on the situation via a dedicated portal on its website . In addition, yesterday, it offered all impacted individuals a 12-month subscription to credit monitoring and identity protection service through Equifax. Today, South Australia's Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Energy & Mining, Tom Koutsantonis , announced that victims of the Optus data breach would receive new driver's licenses free of charge. The driver's licenses that the attackers have stolen will be invalidated, as threat actors could use them to forge fake documents that match entries in the state's system. Finally, Cyber Security Minister Clare O'Neil told ABC during an interview that Australia's current regulatory framework isn't strict enough, and companies need to ramp up their effort to protect customer data as it happens in Europe with GDPR. The official criticized Optus's security stance, saying it ""left the window open"" for the hackers, so this incident might spark regulatory changes in the country.

""The investigation has shown the hackers may have stolen additional personal data and we are notifying the holders of 77,000 payment cards, not previously notified, that the name, billing address, email address, card payment information, including card number, expiry date and CVV have potentially been compromised, and a further 108,000 without CVV,"" stated an update on British Airways' site. ""The potentially impacted customers were those only making reward bookings between April 21 and July 28, 2018, and who used a payment card."" This announcement further states that they do not have conclusive evidence that the data was accessed and are contacting the potentially affected customers. If customers have not heard from them by October 26th at 17:00 GMT, they do not need to be concerned. The British Airways breach was caused by attackers adding the malicious MageCart script to a 3rd party JavaScript library called Modernizr that was used by the site. The malicious script was then able to collect submitted credit card details and payment information and have it sent to a remote server under the attackers control. The ongoing investigation has also concluded that the amount of affected customers is lower than originally reported in September. ""In addition, from the investigation we know that fewer of the customers we originally announced were impacted. Of the 380,000 payment card details announced, 244,000 were affected.

Neiman Marcus data breach: 31 million email addresses found exposed,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/neiman-marcus-data-breach-31-million-email-addresses-found-exposed/,Sergiu Gatlan,"July 8, 2024","A May 2024 data breach disclosed by American luxury retailer and department store chain Neiman Marcus last month has exposed more than 31 million customer email addresses, according to Have I Been Pwned founder Troy Hunt, who analyzed the stolen data. Hunt's findings come after the company filed a breach notification with the Office of the Maine Attorney General, stating that the breach only impacted 64,472 people . In a separate incident notification published on its website, Neiman Marcus revealed that the data exposed in the attack included names, contact information (e.g., email and postal addresses, and phone numbers), dates of birth, gift card info, transaction data, partial credit card (without expiration dates or CVVs) and Social Security numbers, and employee identification numbers. While analyzing the data stolen in the breach, Hunt found 30 million unique email addresses and told BleepingComputer that he also confirmed with multiple people whose data was in the stolen database that the information was legitimate. ""That's obviously a substantial number and I do want to get notifications out to them promptly. The total unique number of addresses I'll be referring to is 31,152,842,"" Hunt told BleepingComputer. He said that roughly 105,000 Have I Been Pwned subscribers found in the data set will receive an email informing them of this massive data breach. When BleepingComputer contacted a Neiman Marcus spokesperson to confirm Hunt's findings, they declined to comment. Instead, they pointed us to the data security notification published on the company's website and said that the 64,472 people mentioned in the Maine filing are those who have received data breach notifications. In June, after it first disclosed the data breach, Neiman Marcus also linked the incident to the Snowflake data theft attacks in a statement to BleepingComputer. ""Neiman Marcus Group (NMG) recently learned that an unauthorized party gained access to a cloud database platform used by NMG that is provided by a third party, Snowflake,"" the company told BleepingComputer. The disclosure and the data breach notifications came after a threat actor using the ""Sp1d3r"" handle put Neiman Marcus' data up for sale on a hacking forum, asking $150,000 for 12 million gift card numbers, 70 million transactions with full customer details, and 6 billion rows of customer shopping records, store information, and employee data. While the threat actor first said the company refused to pay an extortion demand, it subsequently took down the forum post and the data sample, hinting that the company may have begun negotiating. A joint investigation by SnowFlake, Mandiant, and CrowdStrike revealed that a financially motivated threat actor tracked as UNC5537 used stolen customer credentials to target at least 165 organizations that failed to configure multi-factor authentication (MFA) protection on their SnowFlake accounts.

"Security bug hunters focus on misconfigured services, earn big rewards",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/security-bug-hunters-focus-on-misconfigured-services-earn-big-rewards/#comment_form,Ionut Ilascu,"March 9, 2021","An overview of the hacking activity on the HackerOne vulnerability coordination and bug bounty platform shows that misconfiguration of cloud resources is quickly becoming a hot target for ethical hackers. This type of weakness is among the top threats in an organization as cybercriminals are quick to take advantage of faults in this category to carry their attacks. In its report today, HackerOne reveals that last year, the number of misconfiguration reports submitted through the platform more than tripled. This type of error did not make it into the top ten list of vulnerabilities but it recorded an increase of 310%, the highest by far when compared to all others. HackerOne says that the surge was caused by the pandemic, which led many organizations to shift to cloud resources to keep the business running with employees working from home. ""New technologies and methodologies mean there are usually misconfigurations along the way that lead to vulnerabilities,"" says Shubham Shah, web app penetration tester and co-founder of Assetnote. Cybercriminals have indeed capitalized on misconfiguration weaknesses, proof being all the data leaks offered for sale or shared freely on underground forums. A threat actor known as ShinyHunters is constantly dumping databases with user records from dozens of companies offering online services [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ]. Translated into numbers, the actor has already leaked tens of millions of records. Most of the data consists of email addresses, names, passwords (typically hashed), IP addresses, and other personal information belonging to registered users. Cybercriminals are not the only ones showing the risk of misconfigured resources. Tillie Kottmann, a developer and reverse engineer has collected and published source code, some of it proprietary, from tens of high-profile companies such as Microsoft, Intel, Nissan, Sonarqube, Adobe, Lenovo, AMD, Qualcomm, Motorola, or Disney [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ]. As Kottmann told BleepingComputer on more than one occasion, most of the repositories had been copied because of misconfigured resources (exposed on the public web, weak credentials) that allowed easy access. In terms of bounties paid, HackerOne says that 2020 was the year when hackers earned $40 million from disclosing vulnerabilities to companies on the platform. This figure contributed significantly to the HackerOne reaching the milestone of 100 million milestone paid to hackers on the platform. However, some hackers were more prolific than others.

Expensive Investigations Drive Surging Data Breach Costs,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/expensive-investigations-drive-surging-data-breach-costs/,Home,"September 20, 2023","The dreaded data breach is an outcome feared by companies of all sizes in today’s threat landscape, largely due to the significant costs involved. Each year, IBM’s eagerly anticipated Cost of a Data Breach Report seems to come with the bad news of an increase in data breach costs, and 2023 is no exception. Threat actors continue their relentless pursuit of data as the most valuable company resource to compromise in cyberattacks. The average cost of a data breach now stands at an all-time high of $4.45 million. While this overall figure receives much of the publicity in media reports, there’s less emphasis on how increasingly costly incident investigations drive much of this year-on-year increase. Read on to dive deeper into why data breach investigations are so expensive and find out what your business can do to reduce these costs. Investigating a data breach involves a resource-intensive combination of technical, administrative, legal, and communication activities, which together prove rather pricey for companies. The 2022 IBM report marked the point at which incident investigations (referred to in the report as ‘detection and escalation’) took over as the costliest category of data breach expenses. That trend continues in the 2023 report , which shows that detection and escalation cost an average of $1.58 million per breach, or over 35 percent of the total average cost. But why are data breach investigation costs on the rise? Here are some factors driving the increased expenses: Reducing the cost of data breach investigations requires a mix of proactive and reactive measures to ensure not only that you're ready when a breach occurs but also that you're taking steps to prevent them in the first place. Here are some suggestions for preventing data breaches in the first place: Information governance defines and enforces policies, procedures, standards, and controls around the management of data. The objective is to make sure that your company and its people handle data efficiently, securely, and in compliance with legal and regulatory obligations. Robust information governance is pivotal for answering questions like what data you have, where it’s stored, and who has access to it. Policy-based controls and tools can help maintain an inventory of your information assets and delete unneeded data on time. Uniform procedures mean that users are more likely to consistently handle and store data, regardless of their business department/unit. All of this helps to uncover gaps in protection for your data assets and reduce breach risks due to lax practices. Regularly educate employees about the importance of security and how to recognize phishing attempts and other threats. Employees should understand their responsibilities in handling data securely and know how to avoid risky practices, such as visiting untrusted websites. A security-conscious workforce goes a long way towards reducing risks from the significant human factor in data breaches. Treat security training and awareness as ongoing throughout the year rather than an annual or quarterly internal box to tick. Regular reminders dotted around the office, a range of different media to spread awareness, and some fun exercises can all help reinforce what’s important to learn (and remember). Continuous vulnerability management (CVM) takes a more proactive approach to identifying, assessing, and addressing vulnerabilities in an organization's IT environment. Vulnerability management is often too reactive, which leaves gaping holes that threat actors can find and exploit to access data. One study from 2020 found that 84 percent of companies had high-risk vulnerabilities that were accessible and exploitable at their network perimeter. The CVM approach is to routinely scan your IT infrastructure for known vulnerabilities. Early detection allows your business to patch or mitigate vulnerabilities before hackers exploit them in their pursuit of data. With CVM, you’re more likely to apply software updates and patches and avoid data breaches that stem from outdated, vulnerable code. Simulated cyberattacks involve security professionals attempting to breach your defenses in a scenario that mirrors a real-world cyberattack. Simulated attacks help pinpoint weaknesses in infrastructure, applications, and other systems that you didn’t even know about. Discovering these gaps proactively enables you to address them before they're exploited ‘in the wild’ by data-hungry adversaries. Another benefit of addressing weaknesses found during simulated attacks is that it’s typically less expensive than managing the fallout from a real data breach. Proactive testing can save significant costs in the long run from direct remediation expenses to reputational damages and potential fines. Effective forensic and investigative activities drive faster detection and response to data breaches. Delays in identifying and containing breaches lead to higher investigation costs. It takes companies 204 days on average to identify a breach and 73 days to contain each breach in 2023, as reported by IBM. Actionable and reliable cyber threat intelligence (CTI) plays an instrumental role in informing forensic and investigative activities. As a result, good CTI helps you respond to breaches faster and more cost-effectively. CTI involves gathering, analyzing, and disseminating information about current and potential cyber threats and attack methods. The difficulty with gathering good cyber threat intelligence is that it’s time-consuming, which is not ideal given that your in-house security staff deal with many other problems and priorities each day. Chronic labor market shortages don’t help; CTI requires experts who know what intel sources are good, and how to analyze data to distinguish between useful and useless information. Despite its power in reducing data breach costs and keeping your fingers on the pulse of a rapidly evolving threat landscape, 79 percent of security professionals say they make decisions without any threat intelligence. To overcome this dearth of intelligence-backed decisions when trying to swiftly detect and respond to data breaches, consider leveraging Cyber Threat Intelligence with Outpost 24’s Threat Compass. Our solution is modular, which means you get to select only the types of intelligence that you feel are most pertinent for your business, sector, and areas of cyber risk.

Coinbase breach tied to bribed TaskUs support agents in India,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/coinbase-breach-tied-to-bribed-taskus-support-agents-in-india/,Bill Toulas,"June 3, 2025","A recently disclosed data breach at Coinbase has been linked to India-based customer support representatives from outsourcing firm TaskUs, who threat actors bribed to steal data from the crypto exchange. According to Reuters, who spoke to numerous TaskUs employees, the data breach was first discovered in January after a TaskUs employee was caught capturing photos of her computer screen using a personal device. Reportedly, the incident was witnessed by multiple TaskUs employees, and during the subsequent investigations, two admitted they were funneling sensitive Coinbase user data to external hackers in exchange for bribes. Upon confirming the data theft in January 2025, TaskUs informed Coinbase accordingly, four months before the breach was publicly disclosed. Coinbase first disclosed the incident on May 15, stating that rogue support agents stole customer data, including names, emails, partial financial information and SSN, transaction history, and ID document scans. ""Cyber criminals bribed and recruited a group of rogue overseas support agents to steal Coinbase customer data to facilitate social engineering attacks. These insiders abused their access to customer support systems to steal the account data for a small subset of customers,"" read Coinbase's statement . Coinbase further stated that the threat actors demanded a ransom payment of $20,000,000 from Coinbase not to publish the stolen data. Instead of succumbing to the demands, the cryptocurrency exchange offered an equal-value reward to unmask those responsible for the extortion attempt. Coinbase estimated that the incident would cause losses of up to $400 million. On May 21, Coinbase started notifying nearly 70,000 customers who were impacted by the incident. BleepingComputer contacted both Coinbase and TaskUs about the Reuters report, and a TaskUs spokesperson confirmed that they were involved but stated the employees were recruited as part of a much larger, coordinated criminal campaign. ""Early this year we identified two individuals who illegally accessed information from one of our clients,"" TaskUs told BleepingComputer. ""We believe these two individuals were recruited by a much broader, coordinated criminal campaign against this client that also impacted a number of other providers servicing this client."" ""We immediately reported this activity to the client, terminated the individuals involved, and are coordinating with law enforcement. Out of an abundance of caution, TaskUs ceased all Coinbase operations in Indore, India, in early January 2025, impacting 226 teammates. Following the investigation, all teammates, excluding the two bad actors, were offered a generous severance package, including six months of pay."" Indian media previously covered TaskUs' firing of employees in India, which led to protests by staff. Coinbase has not responded to BleepingComputer's request for a comment. It's budget season!

Celsius email system breach leads to phishing attack on customers,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/celsius-email-system-breach-leads-to-phishing-attack-on-customers/,Lawrence Abrams,"April 15, 2021","Cryptocurrency rewards platform Celsius Network has disclosed a security breach exposing customer information that led to a phishing attack. Today, Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky stated that Celsius' third-party marketing server was compromised, and threat actors gained access to a partial Celsius customer list. ""An unauthorized party managed to gain access to a back-up third-party email distribution system which had connections to a partial customer email list. Once inside the system, this unauthorized party sent a fraudulent email announcement, of which we know some of the recipients to be Celsius customers."" ""The intent was to make the recipients believe the fraudulent email came from Celsius, that the fraudulent site was a true Celsius site, and to take ownership of recipients’ cryptocurrency assets from their personal (non-Celsius) wallet by prompting the user to provide the seed phrase to their personal wallet address,"" disclosed a Celsius advisory . After gaining access to the customer list, the threat actors impersonated Celsius Networks in phishing texts and emails that promoted a new Celsius Web Wallet. As an incentive to get people to visit the site, the text states Celsius is offering $500 in the CEL cryptocurrency if they create a wallet and enter a special promo code. Clicking on the link led recipients to the phishing site celsiuswallet[.]network, which is now down, that asked visitors to create a Celsius Web Wallet. When you attempted to create this fake wallet, the site asked visitors to link their other online wallets and input those wallet's seed phrases. Once this seed phrase is provided, the threat actors can import your wallet and steal any cryptocurrency within it. VirusTotal shows that the celsiuswallet[.]network phishing domain initially had a DNS SOA record that indicated it was registered at the Njalla registrar. Njalla is a registrar located in Sweden that is a favorite for certain threat actors, such as the Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear Russian hacking groups. The domain is 1 day old and registered through NJALLA. Njalla is a preferred registrar from Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear. This alone already shows the people behind this website have at least a little knowledge about Russian MO.

The Miami-based company operates 12 locations across the United States and India, and it also provides revenue cycle management services to over 6,000 healthcare providers, helping them reduce operating costs and maximize revenue. Medisund says in a data breach notification letter filed with the Office of Maine's Attorney General that it spotted the breach more than one year ago, in December 2023, after detecting suspicious activity on its network. ""Upon discovering the suspicious activity, Medusind took the affected systems offline and hired a leading cybersecurity forensic firm to conduct an investigation,"" according to the breach notice. ""Through this investigation, we found evidence that a cybercriminal may have obtained a copy of certain files containing your personal information."" In the Maine filing , the company revealed that the December 2023 breach affected the personal and health information of 360,934 individuals. Documents exposed in the incident contained the following data types, although the impacted information varies by affected individual: Medusind offers those affected by this data breach two years of free Kroll identity monitoring services, including credit monitoring, fraud consultation, and identity theft restoration. It also warned them to keep track of their account statements for signs of potential identity theft and fraud attempts and to monitor credit reports for unauthorized or suspicious activity. These notifications come after the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) proposed updates to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) in late December 2024 to secure patients' health data following a surge in massive healthcare security breaches and data leaks affecting hospitals and Americans in recent years. These overhauled cybersecurity rules mandate healthcare organizations to encrypt Americans' protected health information (PHI), implement multifactor authentication wherever possible, and segment networks to make it harder for cybercriminals to move laterally through them.

Republican Governors Association email server breached by state hackers,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/republican-governors-association-email-server-breached-by-state-hackers/#comment_form,Sergiu Gatlan,"September 20, 2021","The Republican Governors Association (RGA) revealed in data breach notification letters sent last week that its servers were breached during an extensive Microsoft Exchange hacking campaign that hit organizations worldwide in March 2021. RGA is a US political organization and a tax-exempt 527 group that provides Republican candidates with the campaign resources needed to get elected as governors across the country. Following an investigation started after March 10, ""RGA determined that the threat actors accessed a small portion of RGA’s email environment between February 2021 and March 2021, and that personal information may have been accessible to the threat actor(s) as a result."" Even though the RGA said that, at first, it wasn't able to discover if any personal information was impacted, a subsequent ""thorough data mining effort to identify potentially impacted individuals"" revealed that names, Social Security numbers, and payment card information were exposed in the attack. RGA discovered that individuals affected by this data breach had their personal information exposed on June 24 and completed its ""data mining"" efforts on September 1. ""Once potentially impacted individuals were identified, RGA worked to identify addresses and engage a vendor to provide call center, notification, and credit monitoring services,"" RGA told impacted individuals in a breach letter sent on September 15. ""RGA is also offering you two (2) years of complimentary credit monitoring and identity restoration services with Experian. RGA has also notified the Federal Bureau of Investigation, certain state regulators, and the consumer reporting agencies of this incident as required."" A Republican Governors Association spokesperson was not available for comment when contacted by BleepingComputer earlier today. The massive scale hacking campaign RGA refers to in its data breach notification letter targeted more than a quarter of a million Microsoft Exchange servers, owned by tens of thousands of organizations around the world. The attackers exploited four zero-days (collectively known as ProxyLogon ) in attacks targeting on-premises Microsoft Exchange servers in indiscriminate attacks against orgs from multiple industry sectors worldwide, with the end goal of stealing sensitive information. Threat actors behind ProxyLogon attacks have also been observed deploying web shells , cryptomining malware , as well as DearCry and Black Kingdom ransomware payloads on hacked Exchange servers. After Microsoft disclosed the attacks in early March, Slovak internet security firm ESET spotted at least ten APT groups attacking vulnerable Exchange servers. Microsoft said at the time that the Chinese state-sponsored hacking group known as Hafnium was behind some of these attacks. ""Historically, Hafnium primarily targets entities in the United States for the purpose of exfiltrating information from a number of industry sectors, including infectious disease researchers, law firms, higher education institutions, defense contractors, policy think tanks and NGOs,"" Microsoft said . In July, the company's attribution was confirmed when the US and allies, including the European Union, the United Kingdom, and NATO, officially blamed China for this widespread Exchange hacking campaign . The Biden administration attributed ""with a high degree of confidence that malicious cyber actors affiliated with PRC’s MSS conducted cyber espionage operations utilizing the zero-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server disclosed in early March 2021.""

"Dave data breach affects 7.5 million users, leaked on hacker forum",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dave-data-breach-affects-75-million-users-leaked-on-hacker-forum/,Lawrence Abrams,"July 26, 2020","Overdraft protection and cash advance service Dave has suffered a data breach after a database containing 7.5 million user records was sold in an auction and then released later for free on hacker forums. Dave is a fintech company that allows users to link their bank accounts and receive cash advances for upcoming bills to avoid overdraft fees. Subscribers who need extra money to pay a bill can get a payday loan up to $100, but cannot receive another loan until it is repaid. A threat actor released a database containing 7,516,691 users records for free on a hacker forum on Friday. After reaching out to Dave regarding their database being leaked, Dave disclosed the incident as a data breach a day later. In a statement sent to BleepingComputer last night, Dave says their database was breached after Waydev, a former third-party service provider used by the company was breached. ""As the result of a breach at Waydev, one of Dave’s former third party service providers, a malicious party recently gained unauthorized access to certain user data at Dave, including user passwords that were stored in hashed form, using bcrypt, an industry-recognized hashing algorithm."" ""The stolen information also included some personal user information including names, emails, birth dates, physical addresses and phone numbers. Importantly, this did not affect bank account numbers, credit card numbers, records of financial transactions, or unencrypted Social Security numbers. Dave has no evidence that any unauthorized actions were taken with any accounts or that any user has experienced any financial loss as a result of this incident."" ""As soon as Dave became aware of this incident, the company immediately initiated an investigation, which is ongoing, and is coordinating with law enforcement, including with the FBI around claims by a malicious party that it has “cracked” some of these passwords and is attempting to sell Dave customer data. Dave's security team quickly secured its systems and has been working around the clock to keep customers’ accounts safe. Dave is in the process of notifying all customers of this incident along with performing a mandatory reset of all Dave customer passwords. Dave also retained CrowdStrike, a leading cybersecurity consultant, to assist,"" Dave.com stated in a statement send to BleepingComputer. It is not known how Waydev was breached, but BleepingComputer has contacted them for more information. In samples seen by BleepingComputer, the released database contains names, phone numbers, addresses, birth dates, encrypted social security numbers, email addresses, and Bcrypt hashed passwords. While Dave is performing a mandatory password reset on all accounts, if the same password is used at another site, those accounts can also be breached. Therefore, it is strongly advised that all users immediately change any passwords for accounts that used the same account credentials as in Dave. While Dave has since responsibly disclosed their data breach in an almost record-setting time, there is a bit more to the story. Earlier this month, cyber intelligence firm Cyble told BleepingComputer that a threat actor was auctioning the database for Dave on a hacker forum. At the time, Cyble had told Dave about the auction and were told that the issue was being worked on. In addition to Dave, the same actor was also auctioning databases for Swvl.com and Dunzo.com. On July 11th, 2020, Dunzo disclosed that they suffered a data breach. On approximately July 14th, 2020, the Dave auction post was deleted from the hacker forum, and Cyble learned that it was sold in a private sale for roughly $16,000. Fast forward to July 24th, 2020, and a data breach seller known as ShinyHunter released the entire database for free on a different hacker forum. The leaked Dave database contains 7,516,691 user records and 3,092,396 email addresses. As previously stated, the passwords are encrypted using Bcrypt, and the database also contains encrypted social security numbers. ShinyHunter is a well-known data breach seller who has been responsible for selling and leaking numerous databases in the past, including HomeChef, ChatBooks, Chronicle.com , Wattpad , Tokopedia . It is not known why ShinyHunter leaked this database rather than continue to sell it, but now that it is leaked, other threat actors will dehash the passwords and use the accounts in credential stuffing attacks. As previously advised, be sure to change your password at any other sites where you used the same password as in the Dave app. Whether you're cleaning up old keys or setting guardrails for AI-generated code, this guide helps your team build securely from the start.

A sample of the data breach notice shared with the Office of the Maine Attorney General says that the company detected a cyberattack on several of its systems on March 20. The investigation revealed that hackers had intermittent access to Forever 21 systems between January and March this year and leveraged this access to steal data. “The investigation revealed that an unauthorized third party accessed certain Forever 21 systems at various times between January 5, 2023, and March 21, 2023,” reads the notice . “Findings from the investigation indicate the unauthorized third party obtained select files from certain Forever 21 systems during this time period” - Forever 21 The data breach notice sent on August 29 to 539,207 impacted individuals mentions the following data types as potentially exposed: BleepingComputer has contacted Forever 21 to determine if the security incident has impacted both customers and employees, and a spokesperson of the firm has sent the following statement: The event was limited to current and former Forever 21 employees and did NOT affect personal data pertaining to Forever 21 customers. In the notice, Forever 21 reports that they have taken measures to ensure the hackers have erased the stolen data, an indication that the company communicated with the attacker. This typically happens after ransomware attacks, when the victim engages in negotiation with the hackers to pay a more reasonable ransom. However, a ransomware attack on Forever 21 has not been confirmed. Also, the firm states it has no indication that the stolen data has been shared with other cybercriminals and characterizes the risk arising from the event for exposed people as “low.” Additionally, all notice recipients will find enclosed instructions on how to enroll for a free-of-charge 12-month fraud and identity theft protection service.

When a company is breached, threat actors will typically download accessible databases, including account records. These databases are then sold directly to other threat actors, or the hackers utilize data breach brokers to sell them on their behalf. Over the past month, a known and reputable data breach broker has been selling numerous databases on hacker forums that they state were acquired in data breaches conducted in 2020. Each of the fourteen databases being sold contains different information, but they all include usernames and hashed passwords. The databases currently being sold by this broker are for fourteen companies that include game sites, food delivery services, Soccer streaming, online fashion, and loans. Of the databases being sold, only four of the companies were known to be breached in the past. These are HomeChef , Minted , Tokopedia , and Zoosk. The data breach broker told BleepingComputer that the prices for these databases can be as low as $100, while others that he is selling are $1,100. The companies who were allegedly breached and whose databases are being sold are listed below. From samples of user records seen by BleepingComputer, the data breaches look legitimate, but they have not been confirmed directly by the companies. If real, though, these databases are a serious concern as they contain a combined total of 132,957,579 user records that contain a large amount of information that can be used in credential stuffing attacks at other sites. In addition to these alleged 2020 breaches, the broker is also selling databases from older breaches including Star Tribune, EpicGames, ZyngaPoker, ReverbNation, Wirecard, ClickFunnels, and many more. After learning of these alleged data breaches, BleepingComputer had attempted to contact the affected companies but has not heard back as of yet. Unfortunately, this is all too common.

Companies start reporting ransomware attacks as data breaches,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/companies-start-reporting-ransomware-attacks-as-data-breaches/#comment_form,Lawrence Abrams,"July 4, 2020","Corporate victims are finally starting to realize that ransomware attacks are data breaches and have begun to notify employees and clients about data stolen data. A tactic used by almost all enterprise-targeting ransomware is to steal unencrypted files before encrypting a breached network. The threat actors then use these stolen files as leverage by threatening to leak or sell the data if a ransom is not paid. If a victim does not pay the ransom, the threat actors will publicly post the data on data leak sites created to shame the victim. This tactic is being conducted by almost all ransomware operations, including Maze, REvil, Netwalker, DoppelPaymer, CLOP, RagnarLocker, Nephilim, Ako, and others. The data stolen in these attacks can be damaging to a company as it commonly includes financials, trade secrets, unpublished reports, and emails. It can also, though, be a massive problem for employees whose social security numbers, passports, medical records, termination letters, bank accounts, salary information, and more are stolen in these attacks. Unfortunately, many companies choose to sweep ransomware attacks under the rug and do not adequately disclose that personal data was stolen, even to employees who were affected. Numerous times in the past, employees of ransomware attacks have contacted BleepingComputer to learn more about what was stolen in an attack because the company they work for was denying it. ""Can you share what was stolen? We were just told that there were IT problems and they are denying any attack,"" an employee of a breached company asked BleepingComputer. Another employee contacted us after a company was hit with a ransomware attack where data was stolen and told us that their company was not providing any information. ""I have not received any word from anyone about the data breach. Management has been very quiet,"" another employee told BleepingComputer in an email. The denial of stolen data is not fair to employees, as the attackers could use their stolen personal information for identity theft and fraud. If an employee does not know what happened, they have no way to protect themselves. The good news is that corporate victims are finally starting to issue data breach notifications when affected by a ransomware attack. In addition, most of them offer free credit monitoring and identity theft protection to affected employees and clients so that they can be alerted if their data is used publicly or for fraud. Some of the companies that BleepingComputer has seen issuing data breach notifications include: RailWorks Corporation disclosed a ransomware attack that led to the exposure of current and former employees' personal information. ExecuPharm publicly disclosed a CLOP Ransomware attack and issued a notice of data breach letter to affected individuals. Fortune 500 company Magellan Health Inc announced that they were a victim of a ransomware attack on April 11, 2020, which led to the theft of personal information.

US defense contractor Electronic Warfare hit by data breach,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-defense-contractor-electronic-warfare-hit-by-data-breach/,Bill Toulas,"November 5, 2021","US defense contractor Electronic Warfare Associates (EWA) has disclosed a data breach after threat actors hacked their email system and stole files containing personal information. The company claims the breach's impact was limited but confirmed that the threat actor managed to exfiltrate files containing sensitive information. As detailed in a notice to the Montana Attorney General's office, EWA discovered that a threat actor took over one of their email accounts on August 2, 2021. The firm noticed the infiltration when the hacker attempted wire fraud, which appears to be the primary goal of the actor. ""Based on our investigation, we determined that a threat actor infiltrated EWA email on August 2, 2021. We were made aware of the situation when the threat actor attempted wire fraud,"" reads EWA's data incident notification . ""We have no reason to believe the purpose of the infiltration was to obtain personal information. Nevertheless, the threat actor's activities did result in the exfiltration of files with certain personal information (as described below)."" Based on the investigation that followed, it was discovered that names, social security numbers (SSNs), and the driver's license of the notice recipients were also stolen. As such, the wire fraud attempt may have been a distraction, which is entirely plausible for sophisticated actors who are interested in targeting highly-sensitive firms of this type. It is unclear if the stolen information affects only the company's employees and whether or not technical documents have also been stolen during the incident. In response to the security lapse, the company is now offering a two-year subscription to identity theft protection services through Equifax. Moreover, the notice urges recipients to monitor their credit reports and financial account statements closely. EWA is a specialist in high-tech defense hardware and software solutions for communication, access control, simulation, training, management, testing, and monitoring systems (radars). Many of these products are made for highly sensitive customers, including the U.S. Department of Defense (Army, Navy, Air Force, DARPA, OSD), the Department of Justice, and Homeland Security (DHS). A data breach on the firm's email systems may have also compromised military technology secrets as EWA develops and designs these products internally. EWA also develops commercial products through subsidiary brands like Corelis (electronic testing and analysis) and Blackhawk (debugging tools). We have reached out to EWA asking for more details about the hacking incident and the exact impact it has on them, and we will update this post if we receive a response. Electronic Warfare Associates has been hit by hackers again, with one notable case being a 2020 Ryuk ransomware attack. A few days before that incident made headlines, BleepingComputer reported on the emergence of a specialized new version of Ryuk which focused specifically on the stealing of data from government and military entities.

FBCS is a nationally licensed debt collection agency in the U.S., specializing in collecting unpaid debts from consumer credit, healthcare, commercial, auto loans and leases, student loans, and utilities. In late April, the firm reported that roughly 1.9 million people in the U.S. had sensitive personal information compromised in a data breach incident on February 14, 2024. The information that unauthorized actors reportedly accessed includes: The firm has now submitted a supplemental notice to the Office of the Maine AG , stating that the total number of persons affected is now 3,226,631 people, which adds over a million to the original figure. New data breach notifications have been sent out to those people, starting on May 29, informing them of the heightened risks and the actions they need to take, albeit with a three-month delay. Additionally, notice recipients will receive instructions on enrolling in a free 24-month credit monitoring and identity restoration service via CyEx. People impacted by the incident are exposed to elevated risks by phishing, fraud, and social engineering attacks, so they’re advised to be cautious with their communications and monitor their bank accounts’ activity closely. The firm assures customers that it is now using a separate environment built from the ground up with stronger security measures to prevent similar breaches in the future. FBCS has not shared any details about the nature of the cybersecurity incident this time. Currently, no ransomware or data extortion groups have assumed responsibility for the attack.

Penn hacker claims to have stolen 1.2 million donor records in data breach,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/university-of-pennsylvania-hacker-claims-1.2-million-donor-data-breach/#comment_form,Lawrence Abrams,"November 2, 2025","A hacker has taken responsibility for last week's University of Pennsylvania ""We got hacked"" email incident, saying it was a far more extensive breach that exposed data on 1.2 million donors and internal documents. On Friday, University of Pennsylvania alumni and students began receiving multiple offensive emails from Penn.edu addresses claiming the university had been hacked and data stolen. ""The University of Pennsylvania is a dog**** elitist institution full of woke retards. We have terrible security practices and are completely unmeritocratic,"" reads the email sent to Penn alumni and students. ""We hire and admit morons because we love legacies, donors, and unqualified affirmative action admits. We love breaking federal laws like FERPA (all your data will be leaked) and Supreme Court rulings like SFFA."" BleepingComputer confirmed the emails originated from connect.upenn.edu, a Penn mailing list platform hosted on Salesforce Marketing Cloud. The university downplayed the incident, describing the messages as ""fraudulent emails"" that were ""obviously fake."" However, the threat actor behind the attack contacted BleepingComputer, claiming the intrusion was far broader and that they had gained access to multiple university systems. The hacker said their group ""gained full access"" to an employee's PennKey SSO account, allowing access to Penn's VPN, Salesforce data, Qlik analytics platform, SAP business intelligence system, and SharePoint files. They said they exfiltrated data for roughly 1.2 million students, alumni, and donors, including names, dates of birth, addresses, phone numbers, estimated net worth, donation history, and demographic details such as religion, race, and sexual orientation. The threat actors shared screenshots and data samples with BleepingComputer and posted them online to prove that they had indeed accessed these systems and stolen data from Penn. The attackers told BleepingComputer they breached Penn's systems on October 30th and completed data downloads by October 31st, when the compromised employee account was locked and access lost. After discovering their access had been revoked, the hacker said they still had access to Salesforce Marketing Cloud and used it to send the offensive mass email to roughly 700,000 recipients. When asked whether the credentials were stolen via an infostealer or phishing, the hacker declined to elaborate, saying the intrusion was simple and caused by Penn's security lapses. The hacker has since published a 1.7-GB archive containing spreadsheets, donation materials, and other files allegedly taken from Penn's SharePoint and Box systems. The attacker told BleepingComputer they were not extorting the university, saying, ""We don't think they'd pay, and we can extract plenty of value out of the data ourselves."" When asked about their motivation, the hackers said the attack was not political but aimed at obtaining Penn's donor database. ""While we're not really politically motivated, we have no love for these nepobaby-serving institutions,"" the hackers told BleepingComputer. ""The main goal was their vast, wonderfully wealthy donor database."" The donor database has not yet been leaked, though the threat actors claim they may release it in a month or two. When contacted with these claims, the University of Pennsylvania told BleepingComputer, ""We are continuing to investigate."" After publishing this story, The Daily Pennsylvanian reported that Penn has referred the security incident to the FBI. ""We understand and share our community’s concerns and have reported this to the FBI. We are working with law enforcement as well as other third-party technical resources to address this as rapidly as possible,"" stated a Penn spokesperson. With a large amount of donor data now exposed, Penn donors should stay vigilant against targeted phishing or social engineering attempts. Attackers could use the stolen information to impersonate the university, solicit fraudulent donations, or gain access to donor credentials to breach their online accounts. Recipients should treat unexpected messages about donations with suspicion and verify their legitimacy directly with Penn before responding.

Japanese watchmaker Seiko breached by BlackCat ransomware gang,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/japanese-watchmaker-seiko-breached-by-blackcat-ransomware-gang/#comment_form,Bill Toulas,"August 21, 2023","The BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware gang has added Seiko to its extortion site, claiming responsibility for a cyberattack disclosed by the Japanese firm earlier this month. Seiko is one of the world's largest and most historic watchmakers, with roughly 12,000 employees and an annual revenue that surpasses $1.6 billion. On August 10th, 2023, the company published a notice of a data breach informing that an unauthorized third-party gained access to at least a part of its IT infrastructure and accessed or exfiltrated data. ""It appears that [on July 28, 2023] some as-yet-unidentified party or parties gained unauthorized access to at least one of our servers,"" reads Seiko's announcement. ""Subsequently, on August 2nd, we commissioned a team of external cybersecurity experts to investigate and assess the situation."" ""As a result, we are now reasonably certain that there was a breach and that some information stored by our Company and/or our Group companies may have been compromised."" Seiko apologized to the potentially impacted customers and business partners and urged them to be vigilant against email or other communication attempts potentially impersonating Seiko. Today, the BlackCat ransomware group claimed to be behind the attack on Seiko, posting samples of data that they claim to have stolen during the attack. In the listing, the threat actors mock Seiko's IT security and leak what appear to be production plans, employee passport scans, new model release plans, and specialized lab test results. Most worryingly, the threat actors have leaked samples of what they claim are confidential technical schematics and Seiko watch designs. This indicates that BlackCat very likely possesses drawings that showcase Seiko internals, including patented technology, which would be damaging to publish and expose to competitors and imitators. BlackCat is one of the most advanced and notorious ransomware gangs actively targeting the enterprise, constantly evolving its extortion tactics. For example, the group was the first to use a clearweb website dedicated to leaking data for a particular victim and, more recently, created a data leak API , allowing for easier distribution of stolen data. Update 8/21/23: After publishing this story, researchers at Curated Intel told BleepingComputer that an initial access broker (IAB) was selling access to a Japanese manufacturing company on July 27th, one day before Seiko said they were initially breached. While the IAB did not share the name of the company they were selling access to, they did say the company is in manufacturing and has '1.8B' in revenue per Zoominfo, which is an exact match to Seiko's Zoominfo page . BleepingComputer has contacted Seiko for additional comments on the threat actor's claims, but we have not received a response by publication time.

According to the Oregon DHS, its Enterprise Security Office Cyber Security team was the one which determined that the email boxes were breached on January 28, 2019. DHS also said that the attackers were stopped from further accessing the hacked mailboxes by resetting the passwords and that an investigation was started to review all the information that might have been exposed, as well as to pinpoint the exact ""number of impacted records that might contain personal information of clients receiving services from DHS."" After the attack was successfully stopped, ""The agency has hired an outside entity, IDExperts, to perform a forensic review to clarify the number and identities of Oregonians whose information was exposed, and the specific kinds of information involved."" DHS states that the PHI impacted in the data breach ""was accessible to an unauthorized person"" and that the information ""may include first and last names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, case number and other information used to administer DHS programs."" Also, ""The department cannot confirm that any clients’ personal information was acquired from its email system or used inappropriately. However, it is notifying the public because information was accessible to an unauthorized person or persons."" Despite that, DHS says that it considers the incident a data breach under Oregon’s Identity Theft Protection Act (ORS 646A.600 to 646A.628). DHS had a security issue affecting employee e-mail accounts.

Canada's largest alcohol retailer's site hacked to steal credit cards,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/canadas-largest-alcohol-retailers-site-hacked-to-steal-credit-cards/#comment_form,Sergiu Gatlan,"January 14, 2023","The Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO), a Canadian government enterprise and the country's largest beverage alcohol retailer, revealed that unknown attackers had breached its website to inject malicious code designed to steal customer and credit card information at check-out. LCBO revealed on Wednesday that third-party forensic investigators found a credit card stealing script that was active on its website for five days. ""At this time, we can confirm that an unauthorized party embedded malicious code into our website that was designed to obtain customer information during the checkout process,"" LCBO said . ""Unfortunately, customers who provided personal information on our check-out pages and proceeded to our payment page on LCBO.com between January 5, 2023, and January 10, 2023, may have had their information compromised."" LCBO added that customers who used the mobile app or the vintagesshoponline.com online store to make orders were not affected. The company is still investigating the incident and is working on identifying all customers affected by this data breach. While the malicious script was active on the retailer's website, the attackers could harvest various personal and financial information submitted by customers during the check-out process. This includes customers' names, email and mailing addresses, credit card information, Aeroplan numbers, and LCBO.com account passwords. BleepingComputer found that the web skimmer was injected into LCBO's online store as an inline script camouflaged as a legitimate Google Analytics tag. The attack was discovered on January 10, when LCBO warned that its website and mobile app were no longer available without explaining why they were taken down. One day later, the Canadian retailer revealed that the app and the LCBO.com website were offline because of a ""cyber incident"" being investigated. On January 12, two days after the breach was detected, LCBO issued a detailed statement revealing the nature of the attack and its impact on customers who used the online store and the mobile app while the credit card skimmer was active. The government-controlled company employs more than 8,000 people and operates 680 retail stores and five regional warehouse facilities. It's also a wholesaler to 450 grocery stores and provides wholesale support for 18,000 bars and restaurants. In web skimming (also known as Magecart ) attacks like the one that affected LCBO's customers, threat actors inject JavaScript-based scripts known as credit card skimmers (aka Magecart scripts, payment card skimmers, or web skimmers) into compromised online stores designed to steal payment and personal information. The stolen info is later sold to other cybercriminals on hacking or carding forums or used in various identity theft or financial fraud schemes.

Hatch Bank discloses data breach after GoAnywhere MFT hack,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hatch-bank-discloses-data-breach-after-goanywhere-mft-hack/#comment_form,Lawrence Abrams,"March 2, 2023","Fintech banking platform Hatch Bank has reported a data breach after hackers stole the personal information of almost 140,000 customers from the company's Fortra GoAnywhere MFT secure file-sharing platform. Hatch Bank is a financial technology firm allowing small businesses to access bank services from other financial institutions. As reported by TechCrunch , data breach notifications sent to impacted customers and filed with Attorney General's offices warned that hackers exploited a vulnerability in the GoAnywhere MFT software to steal the data of 139,493 customers. ""On January 29, 2023, Fortra experienced a cyber incident when they learned of a vulnerability located in their software,"" warned the Hatch Bank data breach notification. ""On February 3, 2023, Hatch Bank was notified by Fortra of the incident and learned that its files contained on Fortra’s GoAnywhere site were subject to unauthorized access."" Hatch says they conducted a review of the data that was stolen and determined that that customers' names and social security numbers were stolen by the attackers. The bank added that it is providing free access to credit monitoring services for twelve months to affected individuals. This is the second confirmed data breach caused by the GoAnywhere MFT attacks, with the first one disclosed by Community Health Systems (CHS) last month. While Hatch Bank did not disclose what threat actor conducted the attack, the Clop ransomware gang told BleepingComputer that they were behind these attacks and had stolen data from over 130 organizations. The ransomware gang says they utilized the zero-day vulnerability in Fortra's GoAnywhere MFT secure file-sharing platform to steal data over ten days. The vulnerability is now tracked as CVE-2023-0669 and is a remote code execution vulnerability allowing remote threat actors to access servers. GoAnywhere disclosed its vulnerability to customers in early February after learning it was being actively exploited in attacks. An exploit was publicly released for the vulnerability a day before the platform received an emergency patch on February 7th. BleepingComputer could not independently confirm Clop's claims that they were behind the attacks, and Fortra never replied to our emails. However, Huntress Threat Intelligence Manager Joe Slowik also found links between the GoAnywhere MFT and TA505 , the hacking group known for deploying Clop ransomware. Clop is known for using a similar tactic in December 2020, when they exploited a zero-day vulnerability in Accellion's File Transfer Appliance (FTA) system to steal data from companies worldwide. Like GoAnywhere MFT, Accellion FTA allows organizations to share files with their customers securely. As part of these attacks, the Clop ransomware gang attempted to extort victims by demanding a $10 million ransom to prevent the stolen data from being published. The Accellion FTA attacks caused widespread damage, with numerous organizations disclosing related breaches, including Morgan Stanley , Qualys , energy giant Shell , supermarket giant Kroger . Multiple universities worldwide were also affected, including Stanford Medicine , University of Colorado , University of Miami, and the University of California. While it is unknown if Clop is demanding similar ransoms to victims of the GoAnywhere MFT attacks, if the gang follows similar tactics, we will begin to see stolen data appear on their data leak site in the future.

Frontier is a leading U.S. communications provider that provides gigabit Internet speeds over a fiber-optic network to millions of consumers and businesses across 25 states. The telecommunications provider says it suffered a cyberattack in mid-April 2024, allowing hackers to access customers' personal information stored on its systems. ""On April 14, 2024, we detected unauthorized access to some of our internal IT systems,"" reads the data breach notification sent to impacted customers. ""Our investigation identified your personal information among the data affected by this incident."" The sample of the notice submitted to the Office of the Maine AG has censored the types of data exposed in this incident, but full names and Social Security Numbers (SSNs) were confirmed as breached for 751895 customers. The telco clarifies that no customer financial information was exposed due to this breach. Frontier says it has informed the regulatory authorities about the security breach and implemented additional measures to strengthen its network security. Investigations on the incident's impact are currently underway. The company enclosed instructions on enrolling in one year of free credit monitoring and identity theft services through Kroll, which impacted clients are recommended to take up as soon as possible. While Frontier did not share many details about the incident in their notification, at the time, the company was forced to shut down some of its systems to contain the attack and prevent it from impacting other devices on the network. Many customers also reported that their Internet connection had been down during the attack, with the support phone numbers playing prerecorded messages instead of redirecting to a human operator. These data breach notifications come after the RansomHub extortion group claimed responsibility earlier this week for the attack on Frontier. On Tuesday, June 4, RansomHub added Frontier Communications to its extortion portal on the dark web, threatening to leak 5GB of data allegedly stolen during the attack, containing the information of 2 million customers. A screenshot (redacted below) contains customer information, such as full name, date of birth, physical address, social security number, email address, subscription status, and service notes. The threat actors have given Frontier until June 14 to respond to their demands, or they will sell the data to a single buyer, the highest bidder. If you are a Frontier customer, it is advisable to treat unsolicited communications with caution, refrain from sharing information with people you don't know, reset your account passwords, and monitor bank statements. RansomHub was recently exposed as a likely buyer of the Knight ransomware source code , but they rarely use encryption in their attacks, typically limiting the scope to data-theft-based extortion. In the case of Frontier Communications, there's no mention of encryption or reports about service outages apart from those linked to the containment measures in mid-April.

The company is sending data breach notifications to customers affected by the incident. ""We are writing to inform you that Auchan has been the victim of a cyberattack. This attack resulted in unauthorized access to certain personal data associated with your loyalty account,"" reads the retailer's notification. According to the sample of the notice, the data exposed in the attack includes full names, title and client status, postal address, email address, phone number, and loyalty card number. The retailer underlines that bank data, passwords, and PIN numbers have not been impacted. In a statement for French media , a company representative said that data belonging to ""several hundred thousand"" of its customers was exposed containing the incident. Auchan is a French multinational retail group operating over 2,100 branches across 13 countries in Europe and Africa. The chain employs 154,000 people and has an annual revenue of over $35 billion. The company said it has notified the French Data Protection Authority (CNIL) about the data breach. In the meantime, Auchan advises letter recipients to remain vigilant for potential phishing attacks leveraging the stolen information. ""We remind you that Auchan will never ask you (whether by email, SMS, or phone) for your login details, passwords, or loyalty card PIN code,"" warned Auchan. ""If you receive such a message, do not click on any link, do not call the indicated number, and ignore the information it contains, as it is most likely a phishing attempt."" BleepingComputer contacted Auchan several days ago to request more information about the attack, but the company has not provided a reply. The data breach at Auchan comes shortly after similar disclosures made by other large entities in France, including Air France and KLM , Orange , and Bouygues Telecom , some of which were linked to ShinyHunters' attacks on Salesforce.

"Zacks Investment Research data breach affects 820,000 clients",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/zacks-investment-research-data-breach-affects-820-000-clients/#comment_form,Bill Toulas,"January 25, 2023","Hackers breached Zacks Investment Research (Zacks) company last year and gained access to personal and sensitive information belonging to 820,000 customers. Founded in 1978, the company helps investors with stock buying decisions by using advanced financial data analytics algorithms. Zacks discovered the at the end of last year that some customer records had been accessed without authorization. An internal investigation into the incident determined that a threat actor gained access to the network somewhere between November 2021 and August 2022. It is unclear if any data was stolen but the information exposed during the breach includes full names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and user passwords for the Zacks.com website. Such details would be valuable in the hands of phishing actors and scammers and might have made it possible for unauthorized users to access Zacks accounts and, by extension, any additional information stored on them. It appears that the data set belongs to a specific set of customers. In the data breach notice delivered to affected individuals, the company clarifies that the incident impacted only customers of the Zacks Elite product that joined between November 1999 and February 2005. Also, the investment research firm says it has no evidence that financial data has been exposed due to the security breach. After learning about the breach, Zacks has initiated the password reset procedure for compromised accounts, forcing users to choose new credentials on their next login. The company says that it also implemented extra security measures on the network and is actively working with an external cybersecurity specialist to develop and install additional protection systems in the immediate future. Users impacted by this security incident are advised to remain vigilant against incoming communications, as scammers can now use their phone numbers and email addresses. Also, those using SMS-based 2FA (two-factor authentication) to secure online investment accounts should switch to a different phone number or 2FA method, as the exposed data can be leveraged by SIM swappers to port the numbers on clone cards and take control of the protected accounts.

The data broker also disclosed in a filing with the Maine Attorney General's Office that the resulting data breach impacted 364,333 individuals who had their personally identifiable information exposed. However, it said the breach only affected their personal information, as the attackers didn't access or steal financial information. ""The personal information involved was limited to name, contact information (such as phone number, postal or email address), Social Security number, driver’s license number or date of birth,"" the spokesperson also told BleepingComputer.

The breach, according to a UK newspaper citing an inside source, took place in around October or November 2016 but was not detected until after six months, in March 2017. The hackers allegedly broke in after managing to take over one of the email server admin accounts. The hack was facilitated because the admin user did not use two-factor authentication for the account. ""In a hack of this scale, criminals or spies will continue to reap dividends years down the road,"" Kenneth Geers, senior research scientist at Comodo told Bleeping Computer via email. ""The attack has gone on for at least six months, so the hackers may have been able to cover their tracks and/or install backdoors for future use,"" Geers added. ""An admin username and password to a global email server is like a digital Swiss Army knife to corporate and client secrets. It is inexcusable for such an admin account not to have two-factor authentication."" Over 244,000 Deloitte employees were using the email server. The company started an investigation into the hack but had never gone public with what happened. The Guardian reported that hackers might have gotten their hands on confidential emails, IP addresses, business plans, architectural diagrams, and health information. Some email file attachments also contained usernames and passwords belonging to US companies and governmental agencies that had contracts with Deloitte. A Deloitte spokesperson admitted to the security breach earlier today, after the news broke, but declined to confirm what the hacker stole. Deloitte is said to be still investigating what areas of its networks hackers managed to access. Investigative reporter Brian Krebs claims the company is playing down the severity of the breach. The company is one of the so-called "" Big Four "" accounting firms, together with Ernst & Young, KPMG, and PricewaterhouseCoopers. The Big Four provide accounting and other financial services to almost all major businesses across the globe. The Deloitte hack is the third security breach at a major financial agency this month alone, after similar incidents at Equifax and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) .

""We recently discovered unauthorized access to our network occurred between September 12, 2020, and approximately September 22, 2020,"" AspenPointe said in a notification sent to clients earlier this month. The organization hired external security experts to investigate the incident and find the extent of the information compromise affecting its network.

BreachForums database and private chats for sale in hacker data breach,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/breachforums-database-and-private-chats-for-sale-in-hacker-data-breach/#comment_form,Lawrence Abrams,"July 27, 2023","While consumers are usually the ones worried about their information being exposed in data breaches, it's now the hacker's turn, as the notorious Breached cybercrime forum's database is up for sale and member data shared with Have I Been Pwned. Yesterday, the Have I Been Pwned data breach notification service announced that visitors can check if their information was exposed in a data breach of the Breached cybercrime forum. ""In November 2022, the well-known hacking forum ""BreachForums"" was itself, breached. Later the following year, the operator of the website was arrested and the site seized by law enforcement agencies ,"" reads the HIBP announcement. ""The breach exposed 212k records including usernames, IP and email addresses, private messages between site members and passwords stored as argon2 hashes."" Breached was a large hacking and data leak forum notorious for hosting, leaking, and selling data stolen from hacked companies, governments, and organizations worldwide. After the FBI arrested the site's admin Pompompurin in March 2023, the remaining administrator, Baphomet, decided to shut the forum down after believing that law enforcement also had access to the site's servers. Baphomet later launched a new Breached Forums clone (called in this article BFv2) with another data breach seller known as Shiny Hunters . The Breached database is currently being sold by a threat actor going by the name 'breached_db_person,"" who told BleepingComputer they shared the database with Have I Been Pwned to prove its authenticity to potential buyers. BleepingComputer has also confirmed that known Breached accounts are listed in the shared member's table. Previous Breached admin Baphomet has also confirmed the authenticity of the database, warning that its sale is part of a ""continued campaign attempting to destroy the community."" ""Not only was the database submitted to HIBP, but it's being actively sold/leaked by at least one person - even attempting to do so on our forum,"" warned Baphomet. ""For that reason I'm sure we're going to see it public soon enough. Judging by the 212k users, this is likely an older database months before the closing of BFv1, seeing that my last backup of the forum has 336k users."" Other than law enforcement, the seller said that only they, Baphomet, and Pompompurin have possession of the database. The threat actor says they are selling the Breached database to only one person for $100,000 - $150,000 and that it contains a snapshot of the entire database taken on November 29th, 2022. BleepingComputer was told that the database is 2 GB and contains all tables, including those for private messages, payment transactions, and the member database. While the FBI already revealed that they gained access to the Breached database after they seized the servers, this data can still be valuable for cybersecurity researchers and potentially other threat actors. The seller, breached_db_person, told BleepingComputer that the private message tables have a lot of incriminating information about forum members and that the ' members ' database contains IP addresses showing that many threat actors don't follow good operational security by using residential IP addresses. The private messages table is valuable as it contains messages sent privately between the different members of the forum, potentially revealing information on past attacks, identities, and other useful information. Samples of the payments table were shared with BleepingComputer and contain information on payments made to purchase forum ranks (membership levels with extra benefits) and credits (a form of currency used on the forum). These payments were processed through CoinBase Commerce or Sellix, with the Coinbase transactions including links to order confirmations containing sensitive information, such as cryptocurrency addresses and Coinbase payment IDs. This cryptocurrency data can be useful to blockchain analytics companies, who can use the cryptocurrency addresses to link threat actors to criminal activity. Breached and its members have been responsible for a wide range of hacks, extortion attempts, ransomware attacks, and the leaking of stolen data for many companies. These breaches include DC Health Link , Twitter , RobinHood , Acer , Activision , and many more. Therefore, the private messages could be invaluable for researchers, with the seller stating that they have already been contacted by cybersecurity firms requesting a copy of the data for their own research. Other threat actors are also showing interest, with the seller saying they received an offer for $250,000. While it is too soon to tell whether the database will ultimately be sold, even if it is, it would not be surprising for the entire database to be leaked for free in the future. It is common for data breaches to first be purchased privately and then released later to increase reputation among the data theft community. Just recently, the seized RaidForums data breach forum also suffered a data breach , and the new BreachedForums clone (BFv2) had its database leaked. It's budget season!

An unauthorized person baited the staff with phishing emails to collect credentials to log into the district's network services. The data breach exposed personally identifiable details of student and selected staff, including names, dates of birth, mailing and home addresses, telephone numbers, social security numbers and/or state student ID numbers. The attacker could also view student enrollment information such as schedule, health data, schools of attendance, transfer information, recorded legal notices, and attendance data. Additionally, the attacker could view data about the students' parents or guardians, and emergency contacts of the district's employees. Another type of data exposed to the intruder includes staff benefits information (health benefits enrollment information, beneficiary identify information, dependent identity information, savings or flexible spending account information), Staff payroll and compensation figures were also available to the attacker, who could view paychecks and pay advices, deduction information, tax information, direct deposit financial institution name, routing number and account number, salary and leave information. It is unclear if the attacker copied the information, but they definitely had access to it between January and November 2018. According to the notification letter from SDUSD, the staff became aware of the intrusion in October and continued investigating without alerting the trespasser. Completing this stage of the investigation is also the reason in delaying the public disclosure. An investigation by our police and IT departments discovered a data breach in which an unauthorized user gained access to a district database. All persons who may have been affected are being notified via email now.

Flagstar, now owned by the New York Community Bank, is a Michigan-based financial services provider that, before its acquisition last year, was one of the largest banks in the United States, having total assets of over $31 billion. A data breach notification sent to impacted customers explains that Flagstar was indirectly impacted by Fiserv, a vendor it uses for payment processing and mobile banking services. Fiserv was breached in the widespread CLOP MOVEit Transfer data theft attacks that have impacted over 64 million people and two thousand organizations worldwide, according to a report by Emsisoft . The attackers exploited a zero-day vulnerability in the MOVEit Transfer product to access Fiserv’s systems and, from there, stole Flagstar customer data the vendor held to provide services. The types of data that were compromised are redacted in the sample data breach notification letters. However, the entry on Maine’s data breach portal lists at least names and Social Security Numbers (SSNs) as stolen by the threat actors. The total number of Flagstar Bank customers impacted by this incident is 837,390 in the United States. This latest breach is the third for Flagstar since March 2021, when it disclosed it suffered a breach from the Clop ransomware gang, who, at that time, hacked its Accellion file transfer server in January of that year. Based on the data samples posted by the ransomware gang, the hackers managed to steal customer and employee information, including names, addresses, phone numbers, tax records, and SSNs. In June 2022, Flagstar disclosed another breach of its corporate network that impacted over 1.5 million of its customers in the U.S. The data compromised in that incident includes at least names and Social Security Numbers. At the time, the company opted again to censor the relevant section on the published notification samples. What is more worrying is that Fiserv offers services to hundreds of banks, which it has indirectly exposed in the past due to other security lapses.

A&A Services, doing business as Sav-RX, is a pharmacy benefit management (PBM) company that provides prescription drug management services to employers, unions, and other organizations across the U.S. On Friday, the company notified the Maine Attorney General's office of a cybersecurity incident in October 2023 that exposed the data of 2,812,336 people. ""On October 8, 2023, we identified an interruption to our computer network. As a result, we immediately took steps to secure our systems and engaged third-party cybersecurity experts,"" reads the notification sent to impacted individuals. ""Our information technology systems (""IT System"") were restored the next business day, and prescriptions were shipped on time without delay."" The impact on its business operations was kept to a minimum, with no delays in the shipment of medical prescriptions or pharmacy claims. While their systems were restored in a day, investigating whether personal data was stolen took much longer. According to the data breach notification, their investigation took almost eight months and was completed on April 30, 2024, with the help of third-party experts. This investigation revealed that the hackers first accessed customer data on October 3, 2023. ""As part of the investigation, we learned that an unauthorized third party was able to access certain non-clinical systems and obtained files that contained personal information,"" informs Sav-Rx. The types of data exposed in this incident include: In a FAQ page on its site, Sav-Rx explains that it took them eight months to send out notices of breach to impacted customers because their initial priority was to minimize interruption to patient care before launching an investigation on the impact of the incident. Sav-Rx also noted that it didn't rush to conclude the investigations, striving for as accurate results as possible. It says its health plan customers (impacted organizations) were notified earlier, between April 30 and May 2, 2024. Sav-Rx then reached an agreement with its business customers to notify impacted individuals, and hence, the letters were circulated late last week. The company notes that it did not have sufficient contact information to notify some individuals in many cases, so people are urged to confirm if they're affected by calling 888-326-0815. Among the new security measures Sav-Rx implemented in response to this incident are setting up a 24/7 security operations center, implementing multi-factor authentication on critical accounts, network segmentation, enhanced geo-blocking, upgraded firewalls and switches, strengthened Linux security, and BitLocker encryption. Though the firm currently has no evidence that the stolen information was misused or disseminated on the dark web, it enclosed instructions in the letters on enrolling in a two-year credit monitoring and identity theft protection service. As the stolen data contains sensitive information that can be used for identity theft, it is strongly advised that those impacted monitor their credit reports for fraudulent activity.

Young Consulting ( now Connexure ) is an Atlanta-based software solutions provider specializing in the employer stop-loss marketplace, assisting insurance carriers, brokers, and third-party administrators in managing, marketing, underwriting, and administering stop-loss insurance policies. Yesterday, the firm started distributing notices of a data breach to almost one million people , some of whom are members of the Blue Shield of California, whose data was stolen in a ransomware attack conducted earlier this year by BlackSuit. The network breach occurred on April 10, but the company discovered it three days later when the attackers triggered the encryption of its systems. The ensuing investigation was concluded on June 28, revealing that the following information had been compromised: full names, Social Security numbers (SSNs), dates of birth, and insurance claim information. Those impacted will be given free-of-charge access to a 12-month complimentary credit monitoring service through Cyberscout, which they have until the end of November 2024 to claim. Potentially impacted individuals should take immediate advantage of this offering as BlackSuit has already leaked the stolen data on its darknet-based extortion portal. Also, they should remain vigilant for unsolicited communications, phishing messages, scamming attempts, and requests for additional information. The threat actors claimed responsibility for the attack at Young Consulting on May 7. They followed up on their threats to leak the stolen data a few weeks later, presumably after they failed to extort the software company. BlackSuit claimed to leak a lot more than what Young Consulting disclosed on the notices to impacted individuals, including business contracts, contacts, presentations, employee passports, contracts, contacts, family details, medical examinations, financial audits, reports, and payments, and various content taken from personal folders and network shares. BleepingComputer has not independently verified these claims. BlackSuit's activities this year have caused massive financial damage to American organizations, with the most notable being the CDK Global outage .

Five ways your data may be at risk — and what to do about it,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/five-ways-your-data-may-be-at-risk-and-what-to-do-about-it/#comment_form,Home,"September 12, 2022","Modern phishing campaigns, malware and other cyberthreats cast a wide net: nobody is “too small to target.” If you’re having trouble getting people to understand the cyber risks facing them, pass along this article. If you’re like most people, your digital life is more significant than ever. We store vast amounts of data — financial records, photos/videos, family schedules, freelance projects and more — on our personal computers and smartphones. Ever consider how disruptive losing that data would be? Or having it made visible to unwanted viewers? The reality is that there are many ways your sensitive files can be lost, damaged or exposed. Let’s take a look at some of the most common threats to your data, and how you can step up your protection today. You’ve almost certainly seen the headlines: ransomware and other cyberattacks have been making big waves in the last couple of years. But most of these news-dominating attacks were against large corporations and government agencies. Think you’re “too small to target”? Sadly, there’s no such thing anymore. Today’s cybercriminals use automation and other advanced technologies to launch widespread attacks against thousands or even millions of users at a time. While they will sometimes target a specific individual or company, the biggest threats don’t discriminate. No matter who you are, advanced anti-malware protection has become critical for keeping your important files, photos, applications and settings safe from encryption — and from prying eyes. Social media platforms are a prime target for cybercriminals. Thousands of accounts are inappropriately accessed every day. If your Facebook or Twitter account is compromised, and you use the same credentials to sign into your bank or email, that data is also at risk — criminals can use automated programs to rapidly try logging into many other websites with a given username/password combination. Even if your accounts aren’t compromised directly, cybercriminals can use public-facing data — about your friends, your employer, your interests — to create convincing phishing messages. These threats might eventually cause you to click on a malicious link or unintentionally download malware. It’s best to use different passwords for each of your accounts, to minimize the potential damage from a data leak. Password managers — popular ones include Bitwarden, LastPass and 1Password — can help you keep track of your credentials. Stay alert for any emails or other messages that seem out of the ordinary, especially if they ask you to click a link or open an attachment. And always remember to be careful about what you post in a public setting! Your operating system (like Windows or macOS) and favorite applications are highly complex pieces of software. Cybercriminals are always searching for new and unexpected ways to exploit these programs. Sometimes, they find flaws in the existing code; other times, a newly introduced feature might break compatibility with other software and open up a loophole. Software companies usually release updates to fix security issues as they’re discovered — but those updates won’t help until they’re actually installed on your computer. And time is of the essence: one recent report found that cybercriminals start searching for vulnerable users just 15 minutes after a new security bug is publicly disclosed. Just the other week , Apple publicly urged users of most of its devices to update their software. The company had discovered a vulnerability affecting many new and old models of iPhone, iPad and even some iPods — one that could let hackers take total control. Installing software updates can be a minor annoyance, but it’s very important to make these a priority. Any piece of hardware is susceptible to failure, and the disks that store your data are no exception. Storage drives (especially hard disk drives, or HDDs) have a limited lifespan. When they do fail, it’s often without warning — one day, your computer simply fails to boot up. If you’ve set up a regular data backup schedule, you’ll always have a recent copy of your important files, one which can be restored to a new storage drive or even an entirely different computer in a flash. We recommend a combination of both local and online, cloud-based backup to ensure that your data is readily available and accessible from anywhere. It’s one thing to have your hard drive fail — but what if your entire device is lost or stolen? Laptops and smartphones, chock-full of valuable data, are prime targets for thieves (the hardware itself is usually worth a lot, too). And we take them everywhere, making them easy to misplace. By one estimate , 8.7 million phones were lost or stolen in 2021 — that’s more than 24,000 per day. This is another scenario where cloud-based backups of your entire system can save you a huge amount of grief. Set them to run on a regular basis, and you’ll be able to access the latest copies of your files online and recover personal data to a new or temporary device. Acronis Cyber Protect Home Office provides complete protection for your digital life. It's the only personal solution with a unique integration of cybersecurity and backup technologies. Safeguard your sensitive data against all modern threats — like cutting-edge cyberattacks, accidental deletion, disk failure, or device loss.

Ticketmaster Announces Data Breach Affecting 5% of All Users,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ticketmaster-announces-data-breach-affecting-5-percent-of-all-users/#comment_form,Catalin Cimpanu,"June 27, 2018","Ticketing service Ticketmaster announced a data breach incident today that affected roughly 5% of its entire customer base, and has resulted in the theft of customer data, Ticketmaster login information, and payment details. The breach didn't occur at Ticketmaster itself, but at Inbenta , a provider of AI-powered live chat widgets, which Ticketmaster was deploying on some of its localized sites across the world. The ticketing service says that on Saturday, June 23, it detected that this live chat widget was being used to deliver malicious software to Ticketmaster users. The malicious software was logging and exfiltrating customer details. The company said that not all site visitors are affected, as not all users logged into the site or made purchases. The malicious data collection appears to have impacted only international users. North American users are not affected, Ticketmaster said. International users who purchased, or attempted to purchase, tickets between September 2017 and June 23, 2018, are affected. UK users are also affected but to a lesser degree. Ticketmaster says the malicious data collection impacted its UK website only between February and June 23, 2018. Ticketmaster is still investigating the incident. Nonetheless, the company has sent out emails to users who it believes were impacted and had their personal data collected. A copy of the email is available below. Ticketmaster UK announces it's suffered a data breach due to malware in a third-party software product from Inbenta. Personal and payment info may have been compromised. pic.twitter.com/i6PJUFEsSv According to the ticketing service, the intruder used malicious code delivered through the Inbenta live chat widget to collect data such as names, addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers, payment details, and Ticketmaster login details. Ticketmaster says it disabled the Inbenta widget on all of its sites on Saturday, after discovering the breach. The company has published a website for its UK users with information on how customers can request free 12 month identity monitoring services. Inbenta has not answered a request for comment from Bleeping Computer at the time of publishing. Bleeping Computer has inquired if the security incident might have affected some of Inbenta's other customers. The company lists on its websites clients such as Groupon, Change.org, Schlage, and Ticketbis. This is not the first time when a live chat widget provider has faced problems. Earlier this year, in April, Sears, Delta Airlines, and Best Buy announced data breaches after an attacker compromised the infrastructure of live chat widget provider [24]7.ai. Also in April, PaneraBread exposed the card details of millions of customers after ignoring a security researcher's warnings for more than eight months. In February, a massive cryptojacking campaign spread to thousands of sites via the BrowsAloud live chat provider, including many US and UK government sites . On Thanksgiving last year , the infrastructure of LiveHelpNow was compromised by a hacker who deployed a copy of the Coinhive in-browser mining script on around 1,500 sites where the widget was being loaded to provide live support capabilities. In addition, security researchers found that some live chat services provided by LiveChat and TouchCommerce also leaked the details of tech support personnel, potentially exposing the employes and their companies to more effective spear-phishing campaigns.

A friend received an email from TripAdvisor.com yesterday and was concerned that it was a phishing email because it stated their email address and password were found in a ""lists of publicly leaked passwords"". Due to that, the company invalidated their password and they would need to reset it before they can login again. While receiving this email may at first make a person think it is a phishing scam, it is in fact a legitimate email. TripAdvisor is doing this to prevent a member's account from being compromised using credential stuffing attacks. A credential stuffing attack is when attackers compile username and passwords that were leaked from previous security breaches and use those credentials to try and gain access to other sites. With new reports of data breaches or leaks coming out almost every day and people using the same password at every site they create an account, TripAdvisor's policy is a good one as it only protects their members. So if you receive this email, do not be worried and just reset your TripAdvisor password at https://www.tripadvisor.com/ MemberForgotPassword if you wish to login to the site again.

InfoTrax Systems, a provider of back-end operations systems and online distributor of MLM software for the Direct Sales industry, only detected the security breach after ""it was alerted that its servers had reached maximum capacity."" The hacker infiltrated InfoTrax’s servers and websites maintained on behalf of the company's clients over 20 times from May 5, 2014, until March 7, 2016, and maintained access to the servers for more than two years per FTC's press release announcing the settlement proposal . InfoTrax was only able to detect the hacker because the archive of stolen data he collected grew so large that one of the servers' hard disks ran out of space. On March 2, 2016, the threat actor was able to access the sensitive info of roughly one million consumers according to the FTC complaint . Specifically, the intruder queried certain databases on InfoTrax’s systems from which the intruder accessed personal information of approximately one million consumers, including: full names; physical addresses; email addresses; telephone numbers; SSNs; distributor user IDs and passwords; and admin IDs and passwords. - FTC To make things even worse, according to the FTC, the company ""stored consumers’ personal information [...] in clear, readable text on InfoTrax’s network."" Subsequently, intruders were able to hack InfoTrax's network again on March 14, 2016, and the network of one of its clients on March 29, 2016, in both occasions malicious code being deployed to successfully collect personal and financial information from thousands of victims. While the total number of consumers InfoTrax stored information on at the time of the hacks, the FTC says that it stored personal info of around 11.8 million individuals as of September 2016. Per the FTC press release containing the proposed settlement published in November 2019, InfoTrax failed to: • inventory and delete personal information it no longer needed; • conduct code review of its software and testing of its network; • detect malicious file uploads; • adequately segment its network; and • implement cybersecurity safeguards to detect unusual activity on its network. ""Service providers like InfoTrax don’t get a pass on protecting sensitive data they handle just because their clients are other businesses rather than individual consumers,"" Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection Andrew Smith said at the time. ""As this case shows, it’s every company’s responsibility to protect customers’ personal information, especially sensitive data like Social Security numbers."" As part of the finalized settlement with the FTC, the company is prohibited from collecting, selling, sharing, or storing any consumer personal information until it addresses the security issues described in the complaint. The Utah-based technology company is also required to obtain third-party audits of their new information security program every two years to confirm its capability to protect the security, integrity, and confidentiality of the information stored on InfoTrax's servers. InfoTrax also published a press release after the FTC's proposed settlement was issued saying that after discovering the intrusion they ""took immediate action to secure the data stored on our servers and to shut down any further unauthorized access."" They reached out to ""affected clients and voluntarily requested the support of law enforcement agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), to determine the nature and scope of the breach."" The company also signed a consent order detailing the security standards it obliges itself to follow, many of the measures being implemented before the FTC's order.

FatFace sends controversial data breach email after ransomware attack,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fatface-sends-controversial-data-breach-email-after-ransomware-attack/,Lawrence Abrams,"March 27, 2021","British clothing brand FatFace has sent a controversial 'confidential' data breach notification to customers after suffering a ransomware attack earlier this year. This week, customers began receiving data breach notifications revealing that the popular lifestyle clothing brand, FatFace, had suffered a data breach after a cyberattack on January 17th, 2021. Data breach at @FatFace . It feels a bit... misleading: “Our systems are fully secure and FatFace remains a safe place to shop online or in person” - except for the data breach they just had! pic.twitter.com/3SjHmwwh7P According to the notification, threat actors gained access to FatFace's network and systems and accessed customer data. This data customers' names, email addresses, mailing addresses, and partial credit card information (last four digits and expiration date). What was controversial about the data breach notification is that it told recipients to ""Please do keep this email and the information included within it strictly private and confidential."" BleepingComputer has covered many data breaches. We have never seen a company asking a user to keep a data breach confidential and likely has no power to make that request. As you can imagine, this single sentence led to quite an uproar on Twitter, with users baffled that the notification would include that type of language. Oh, and the subject of the disclosure email was “Strictly private and confidential - Notice of security incident” - why? It contained no PII other than the recipient’s address, why is a notice of a breach “strictly private and confidential”? That’s really odd. It's a bit rich that @FatFace wait two months to inform their ""valued customers"" of a serious data breach and tell us to keep the email and information included in it strictly private and confidential! @fatface have emailed me to say they have been hacked and my details have been compromised TWO months after it happened and asked me to keep it confidential. Wtf #fatface #gdpr While many felt that FatFace was trying to keep the data breach under wraps, it turns out there was much more to the story. According to Computer Weekly, the data breach was caused by a Conti ransomware attack in January 2021. A ransom note found by Valéry Marchive of ComputerWeekly's sister-publication LeMargIT allowed the publication to review a ransom negotiation between FatFace and the ransomware gang. As is common in today's ransomware attacks, the threat actors reviewed the victim's financial data before deploying the ransomware. This review provided insight into the company's finances, including FatFace's cyber insurance coverage, which the threat actors brought up during the negotiations. While Conti originally asked for $8.5 million, the negotiations ultimately led to a payment of $2 million to gain access to a decryption key and a promise not to leak the 200GB of stolen data. The threat actors stated that they gained access to an internal FatFace workstation via a phishing attack on January 10th, 2021, where they then spread laterally through the network. ""From there, the team was able to obtain general administrative rights and began to move laterally through the network, identifying the retailer’s cyber security installations, Veeam backup servers and Nimble storage. The ransomware attack itself was executed on 17 January and saw more than 200GB of data exfiltrated,"" Computerweekly reported . The Conti gang also provided the victim with a report on how to better protect their network, including email filtering, phishing awareness tests, better Active Directory password policies, EDR technology, and an offline backup strategy. When contacted by ComputerWeekly, FatFace confirmed the ransomware attack and said they reported it to law enforcement and the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). “FatFace was unfortunately subject to a ransomware attack which caused significant damage to our infrastructure."" -FatFace.

Maximus is a contractor that manages and administers US government-sponsored programs, including federal and local healthcare programs and student loan servicing. The company employs 34,300 people and has an annual revenue of about $4.25 billion, with a presence in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom. In an 8-K form filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Maximum disclosed that the data was stolen using a suffered a zero-day flaw in the MOVEit file transfer application (CVE-2023-34362). The Clop ransomware gang widely exploited this flaw to breach hundreds of high-profile companies worldwide. After investigating the breach, Maximus found no indication that the hackers progressed further than the MOVEit environment, which was immediately isolated from the rest of the corporate network. However, this limited access was enough to compromise a large number of individuals to whom the firm is now sending data breach notifications. ""Based on the review of impacted files to date, [Maximus] believes those files contain personal information, including social security numbers, protected health information and/or other personal information, of at least 8 to 11 million individuals to whom the company anticipates providing notice of the incident,"" reads the SEC 8-K filing . ""Maximus currently plans to record an expense of approximately $15 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, representing the Company's best estimate of the total investigation and remediation activities to be incurred related to the incident."" The Clop ransomware gang added Maximus to its dark web data leak site yesterday as part of a big batch of 70 new victims, all having been breached using the MOVEit zero-day flaw. The entry on Clop's site claims they have stolen 169GB of data during the breach on Maximus' MOVEit Transfer server. However, no data has been leaked so far, so the extortion process is still underway. As the list of MOVEit zero-day flaw victims grows and the size of the attack somewhat normalizes the large-scale data breaches that have compromised the data of hundreds of millions, the Clop ransomware gang has resorted to more aggressive extortion tactics. Recently, they launched clearweb sites to leak the stolen data of specific companies, which applies further leverage on the victims as it makes the data more accessible to a broader audience.

In an announcement published today, the companies warned that an internal investigation into the attack has shown that the threat actors had far greater access to customer data than initially thought. More specifically, Medibank has confirmed that the following data was compromised: While data access and data exfiltration are separate things, Medibank found evidence that, in some cases, the threat actors managed to remove some of the accessed data, so customers should assume that all of this data was stolen. ""As previously advised, we have evidence that the criminal has removed some of this data, and it is now likely that the criminal has stolen further personal and health claims data,"" explains the announcement . ""As a result, we expect that the number of affected customers could grow substantially."" Last week, Medibank assured its 2.8 million customers that there was no evidence of any customer data having been accessed or exfiltrated and claimed the hackers didn't encrypt anything before they were stopped. However, many ransomware gangs steal corporate data before attempting to encrypt devices, which appears to have happened during this attack. A few days after the company played down the impact of the security incident, the ransomware gang made contact to extort the company, providing a sample of 100 stolen files out of an alleged 200GB of data stolen during the attack. Medibank soon realized that the threat actors had exfiltrated client data, so the internal investigation took a more targeted approach, eventually revealing a full-scale data breach. Based on this development, Medibank now upgrades its response and support to customers by providing the following: Meanwhile, following a series of high-profile and damaging data breaches that hit several Australian firms in the past couple of weeks, the government is working to introduce stricter data protection laws.

""The types of personal information affected varied by individual, and included information such as name, contact information, date of birth, and Neiman Marcus or Bergdorf Goodman gift card number(s) (without gift card PINs)."" Neiman Marcus said they disabled access to the database platform when the breach was detected, investigated with cybersecurity experts, and notified law enforcement. While gift card numbers for Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman were exposed in the breach, the data did not include PINs, so the gift cards should still be valid. In a statement to BleepingComputer, Neiman Marcus confirmed that the data was stolen from their Snowflake account. ""Neiman Marcus Group (NMG) recently learned that an unauthorized party gained access to a cloud database platform used by NMG that is provided by a third party, Snowflake,"" the Neiman Marcus Group told BleepingComputer. The data breach notifications come after a threat actor named ""Sp1d3r"" put Neiman Marcus' data up for sale on a hacking forum for $150,000, as first shared by HackManac . This threat actor is behind the sale of data for numerous companies breached in the recent Snowflake data theft attacks . While the threat actor did not mention Snowflake in the post, they included ""Raped Flake,"", which is in reference to a custom tool of the same name the threat actors created to steal data from the database platform. According to the threat actor, the stolen data included what Neiman Marcus shared, plus the last four digits of social security numbers, customer transactions, customer emails, shopping records, employee data, and millions of gift card numbers. The threat actor claims to have attempted to extort the company before the forum posting, stating that the company refused to pay an extortion demand. However, soon after the post was made on the forum, it was subsequently taken down along with the data sample, indicating that the company may have begun negotiating with the threat actors. A joint investigation by SnowFlake, Mandiant, and CrowdStrike revealed that a threat actor, tracked as UNC5537, used stolen customer credentials to target at least 165 organizations that had not configured multi-factor authentication protection on their accounts. Mandiant also linked the Snowflake attacks to a financially motivated threat actor tracked as UNC5537 since May 2024. This threat actor is known for breaching organizations, stealing data, and attempting to extort companies into paying a ransom for the data not to be published or leaked to other threat actors. While Mandiant has not publicly disclosed much information about UNC5537, BleepingComputer has learned they are part of a community of threat actors who frequently visit the same websites, Telegram and Discord servers. To breach Snowflake accounts, the threat actor used credentials stolen by information-stealing malware infections dating back to 2020. ""The impacted accounts were not configured with multi-factor authentication enabled, meaning successful authentication only required a valid username and password,"" Mandiant said. ""Credentials identified in infostealer malware output were still valid, in some cases years after they were stolen, and had not been rotated or updated. The impacted Snowflake customer instances did not have network allow lists in place to only allow access from trusted locations."" Snowflake and Mandiant have already notified around 165 organizations potentially exposed to these ongoing attacks.

The incident occurred last month and hit impacted data held by the parent company and its subsidiaries and/or former and current affiliates. Threat actors were not able to complete the attack and encrypt files on the company systems but they spent enough time on the network to access sensitive information and also steal some of it. Pivot’s quick response to the June 12 incident made it possible to continue operations, said Kevin Shank, President and CEO of the company, earlier this month. An investigation of the incident conducted by a cyber forensic firm revealed on July 1 that the intruders had access to and exfiltrated “limited personal information of US employees and consultants.” Specifically, inspection revealed on July 7 that the attackers compromised names, addresses, dates of birth, gender, disability status, and type of insurance coverage. They also pulled payroll data (details about deductions, 401k forms, income, and benefits), banking details (routing and account numbers), social security numbers and related information. In a notification letter for affected parties recorded by the California Office of the Attorney General, the company informs that the hackers accessed data stored by the following subsidiaries and past and present affiliates: Following this incident, all companies have improved their security protocols for defending their networks, email systems, workstations, and personal information. Pivot advises affected parties to take additional steps to protect against identity theft and offers free monitoring solutions to track ill-doings stemming from this attack. Pivot Technology Solutions provides managed IT services to governments, educational institutions, and various organizations in the private sector, some of them being members of Fortune 1,000.

The compromise occurred on January 8, when nine DHS employees fell for a phishing email that provided the attacker access to the mailboxes. A password reset initiated 20 days later stopped the hacker from further accessing the compromised email accounts and investigation confirmed that no malware was planted on the computer network. However, information from up to two million email messages and their attachments was exposed to an unsanctioned party between January 9 and January 28. During this interval, the intruder was able to get first and last names, physical addresses, dates of birth, social security numbers (SSNs), case numbers, protected health information (PHI), and other details used in various DHS programs. In total, information from about 645,000 individuals was exposed. According to the DHS website , the agency ""provides direct services to more than 1 million Oregonians each year.""

SANS shares details on attack that led to their data breach,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sans-shares-details-on-attack-that-led-to-their-data-breach/,Lawrence Abrams,"August 14, 2020","SANS has shared the indicators of compromise for a recent phishing attack that compromised one of their email accounts and led to a data breach. On August 11th, SANS disclosed that they had suffered a data breach after one of their employees fell for a phishing attack that caused 513 emails to be forwarded to attackers. Some of the forwarded emails contained a total of approximately 28,000 records of personal information (PII) for SANS members. When disclosing the attack, SANS stated that they would release information that they discover about the attack to benefit the cybersecurity community. Yesterday, SANS released the indicators of compromise (IOCs) for their phishing attack so that other organizations can make sure they were not affected. According to SANS, the initial attack started with a phishing email pretending to be a file shared by a SANS SharePoint service. The file pretending to be shared was called ""Copy of July Bonus 24JUL2020.xls,"" and the email prompted the user to click on the 'Open' button to access the file. When clicked on, the button would open the default browser to ""https://officei6zq49rv2p5a4xbq8ge41f1enjjczo.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws [.]com/index.html,"" which would immediately prompt the user to enter their Office 365 credentials. When doing so, a Microsoft Office OAuth addon named 'Enable4Excel' would be installed. While the site is no longer active, recipients of this phishing scam had tested this site using the Any.Run and JoeSandBox services, which gives us a small glimpse into the OAuth 'Consent' app being authorized to install. SANS states that once the malicious Office 365 app was installed, it would create a forwarding rule named 'Anti Spam Rule' that monitored for specific keywords. If a matching keyword was found in an email, the email would be forwarded to an external address of 'daemon [@] daemongr5yenh53ci0w6cjbbh1gy1l61fxpd.com.' This list of monitored financial-related keywords are: Based on the name of the 'shared file' and numerous submissions of this hostname to VirusTotal, the phishing campaign was conducted on July 24th, 2020. SANS was not the only target for this phishing scam, and at least two other companies had uploaded similar emails to VirusTotal. The full indicators of compromise disclosed by SANS can be found here . Individual users can quickly check if they have any user consent apps or services tied to their accounts by going here . To remove a listed consent, click on its entry, and on the page that opens, click on the 'Remove these permissions' button to remove it. For Office 365 administrators, Microsoft has documentation on how you can check if users in your organization have installed any OAuth 'Consent' addons. Organizations can also take several measures that should help them further protect their remote workforce from such attacks. These steps include educating employees to spot consent phishing tactics, requiring the use of publisher verified apps, and only allow employees to OAuth apps trusted by the organization or provided by verified publishers.

PharMerica is a pharmacy services provider in 50 U.S. states, operating 180 local and 70,000 backup pharmacies, and serving 3,100 medical facilities nationwide. According to a data breach notification submitted to the Office of the Maine Attorney General , hackers breached PharMerica's system on March 12th, 2023, stealing the full names, addresses, dates of birth, social security numbers (SSNs), medications, and health insurance information of 5,815,591 people. The firm discovered the intrusion on March 14th, 2023, and its investigation determined on March 21st that client data had been stolen. However, notices of a data breach were sent to impacted individuals only last Friday, May 12th, 2023. PharMerica offers one year of identity protection fraud monitoring services through Experian, so affected individuals are recommended to take up the offer to minimize the risk and impact of malicious attacks. Although PharMerica does not mention the type of hacking incident, the Money Message ransomware gang claimed the attack on March 28th, 2023, when they began publishing stolen data. Along with PharMerica, the threat actors listed BrightSpring, a health service provider that merged with PharMerica in March 2019 . Money Message claimed to have stolen 4.7 TB of data during their attack on PharMerica, stating that it consisted of at least 1.6 million unique records of personal information. On April 9th, 2023, the timer ran out, and the threat actors published what they claim is all of the stolen data on their extortion site. Unfortunately, the files are still available for download at this time. To make matters even worse, a threat actor has already posted the entire data dump on a clearnet hacking forum, breaking the file into 13 parts for easier downloading.

Hyundai is a multinational automotive manufacturer selling over half a million vehicles per year in Europe, with a market share of roughly 3% in France and Italy. According to multiple reports on Twitter and a sample of the notice shared by “HaveIBeenPwned” creator Troy Hunt, the incident has exposed the following types of data: The letter also clarifies that the hacker who accessed Hyundai’s database did not steal financial data or identification numbers. Hyundai says they engaged IT experts in response to the incident, who have taken the impacted systems offline until additional security measures are implemented. In the same communication, the South Korean car brand warns its customers to be cautious with unsolicited e-mails and SMS texts claiming to originate from them, as they could be phishing and social engineering attempts. “Although there is no evidence that the data concerned have been used for fraudulent purposes, out of extreme caution, we invite you to pay particular attention and to verify any contact attempt via e-mail, mail and/or text message that may appear to come from Hyundai Italia or by other entities of the Hyundai Group.” says Hyundai Italia. The same letter was sent to Hyundai car owners in France , with both entities informing data protection authorities in the two countries. It is unclear how many Hyundai customers this incident impacts, how long the network intrusion lasted, and what other countries might be affected. BleepingComputer has contacted Hyundai to learn more about the security incident, and we will update this post as soon as we hear back. Hyundai has suffered from a range of cybersecurity issues recently. In February 2023, the company rolled out emergency software updates on several car models impacted by a simple USB cable hack that enabled thieves to steal them.

The university discovered the attack on September 27 and disclosed one month later that it was investigating a cybersecurity incident impacting SUDPS systems. In an update published on Monday, Stanford said the attackers didn't gain access to other systems outside the Department of Public Safety's network. ""The investigation determined that an unauthorized individual(s) gained access to the Department of Public Safety's network between May 12, 2023, and Sept. 27, 2023,"" the university said . According to data breach notifications filed with Maine's Attorney General , the attackers stole documents containing personally identifiable information (PII) belonging to 27,000 individuals.

""For a small number of individuals, this information may also have included biometric data, health/medical information, email address with password, username with password, security questions and answers, digital signature, and credit card information with security codes."" While Stanford has not attributed the September incident to a specific ransomware operation, the Akira ransomware gang claimed the attack in October, saying they stole 430Gb of files from the university's systems. The cybercrime group has since published the stolen data on their dark web leak site, making it available for download via BitTorrent. ​The Akira ransomware operation emerged in March 2023 and quickly gained notoriety by targeting victims across various industry verticals.

"Hackers sell stolen user data from HomeChef, ChatBooks, and Chronicle",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-sell-stolen-user-data-from-homechef-chatbooks-and-chronicle/#comment_form,Ionut Ilascu,"May 8, 2020","Three more high-profile databases are being offered for sale by the same group claiming the Tokopedia and Unacademy breaches, and the more recently reported theft of Microsoft’s private GitHub repositories . Going by the name Shiny Hunters, the group is now selling user records from meal kit delivery service HomeChef, from photo print service ChatBooks, and Chronicle.com, a news source for higher education. Together, the three databases count user records and passwords from 26 million accounts. The ask prices are between $1,500 and $2,500. In a conversation with BleepingComputer, the hackers said that they have more databases from other breached websites. They plan on selling them in the near future. BleepingComputer was unable to independently confirm if the data that is offered for sale is authentic or not; the past two sales suggest that it is. Researchers at digital risk protection company ZeroFox caught the posts from the hackers and assess with high confidence that the breaches are legitimate. With eight million user records, the HomeChef trove is the most expensive. It was advertised today and had not been sold when the researchers saw the hackers’ post. The hackers demand $2,500 for emails, bcrypt-hashed passwords, IP addresses. Although the passwords need to be dehashed to extend the range of illegal activities this database can serve, it still has value. Personally identifiable information (PII) including phone numbers, zip codes, and partial social security numbers are also present in the sample set from the hackers. The post for the ChatBooks database was published on May 3 and the asking price is $2,000 for 15 million rows of data. It did not have any buyers through the dark web forum it was advertised on. From the sample provided by Shiny Hunters, the database has email addresses, passwords hashed with the SHA-512 function, social media access tokens, and some PII. With a price tag of $1,500, the data from Chronicle.com is the cheapest. It is also the smallest, with three million user records. It was posted on May 3 and there are no details about the type of information it contains. Just like with the others, nobody bought it. The lack of buyers makes it probable that the three databases will soon become available on other markets for lower prices. “It is likely that this actor will continue to breach companies and post their content for sale,” notes ZeroFox Alpha Team in a blog post on Thursday.

Hackers leak 2.7 billion data records with Social Security numbers,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-leak-27-billion-data-records-with-social-security-numbers/,Lawrence Abrams,"August 11, 2024","Almost 2.7 billion records of personal information for people in the United States were leaked on a hacking forum, exposing names, social security numbers, all known physical addresses, and possible aliases. The data allegedly comes from National Public Data, a company that collects and sells access to personal data for use in background checks, to obtain criminal records, and for private investigators. National Public Data is believed to scrape this information from public sources to compile individual user profiles for people in the US and other countries. In April, a threat actor known as USDoD claimed to be selling 2.9 billion records containing the personal data of people in the US, UK, and Canada that was stolen from National Public Data. At the time, the threat actor attempted to sell the data for $3.5 million and claimed it contained records for every person in the three countries. USDoD is a known threat actor who was previously linked to an attempted sale of InfraGard's user database in December 2023 for $50,000. BleepingComputer, at the time, contacted National Public Data and never received a response to our email. Since then, various threat actors have released partial copies of the data, with each leak sharing a different number of records and, in some cases, different data. On August 6th, a threat actor known as ""Fenice"" leaked the most complete version of the stolen National Public Data data for free on the Breached hacking forum. However, Fenice says the data breach was conducted by another threat actor named ""SXUL,"" rather than USDoD. The leaked data consists of two text files totaling 277GB and containing nearly 2.7 billion plaintext records, rather than the original 2.9 billion number originally shared by USDoD. While BleepingComputer can't confirm if this leak contains the data for every person in the US, numerous people have confirmed to us that it included their and family members' legitimate information, including those who are deceased. Each record consists of the following information - a person's name , mailing addresses , and social security number , with some records including additional information, like other names associated with the person. None of this data is encrypted. Previously leaked samples of this data also included phone numbers and email addresses, but these are not included in this 2.7 billion record leak. It is important to note that a person will have multiple records, one for each address they are known to have lived. This also means that this data breach did not impact 3 billion people as has been erroneously reported in many articles that did not properly research the data. Some people have also told BleepingComputer that their social security numbers were associated with other people they don't know, so not all the information is accurate. Finally, this data may be outdated, as it does not contain the current address for any of the people we checked, potentially indicating that the data was taken from an old backup. The data breach has led to multiple class action lawsuits against Jerico Pictures , which is believed to be doing business as National Public Data, for not adequately protecting people's data. If you live in the US, this data breach has likely leaked some of your personal information. As the data contains hundreds of millions of social security numbers, it is suggested that you monitor your credit report for fraudulent activity and report it to the credit bureaus if detected. Furthermore, as previously leaked samples also contained email addresses and phone numbers, you should be vigilant against phishing and SMS texts attempting to trick you into providing additional sensitive information.

Krispy Kreme detected unauthorized activity on its IT systems on November 29 and disclosed the incident , along with disruptions to its online ordering, in an SEC filing filed on December 11. The company also took measures to contain the breach and hired external cybersecurity experts to assess the attack's full impact on its operations. While Krispy Kreme has yet to share additional details regarding the November breach, the Play ransomware gang claimed responsibility for the attack in late December, saying they also stole data from the company's network. Play ransomware claimed, without proof, that the allegedly stolen files contain ""private and personal confidential data, client documents, budget, payroll, accounting, contracts, taxes, IDs, finance information,"" and more. After negotiations with the company failed, the ransomware gang released multiple archives containing hundreds of GBs of documents on its dark web leak site on December 21. The Play ransomware operation emerged in June 2022, and its operators are known for stealing sensitive data from compromised systems and using double-extortion tactics to pressure victims into paying a ransom under the threat of leaking the stolen data online. Notable victims include cloud computing company Rackspace , car retailer giant Arnold Clark , the City of Oakland in California, Dallas County , the Belgian city of Antwerp , and, most recently, American semiconductor supplier Microchip Technology . In December, the FBI issued a joint advisory with CISA and the Australian Cyber Security Centre, warning that the Play ransomware gang had breached around 300 organizations globally as of October 2023.

The seller says that they obtained the database recently, following a successful SQL injection attack and that it can be used to steal the funds of premium members. MyFreeCams is a popular adult video chat platform with tens of millions of users. The service provides free access to chat rooms of a large number of models. Free users can upgrade to a premium member account by purchasing tokens that can unlock otherwise restricted features or spent to tip the models. On January 14, a hacker offered to sell a database containing usernames, plain text passwords, and emails belonging to two million paying MyFreeCams users. The seller was offering 10,000 records for $1,500 in Bitcoin, saying that the logins guarantee a profit of at least $10,000 in tokens. Despite the ""generous"" offer, buyers did not form a line and asked instead if they could purchase smaller increments, 1,000 records for $150. By the attention it got, it is safe to assume that at least a few thousand records have been sold. In trying to increase sales, the hacker announced a few days ago that they would sell the records only one time, meaning that buyers would get different account logins. According to CyberNews , who obtained a sample of the records, the database contains usernames, email addresses, passwords in plain text, and the balance of MyFreeTokens for each account. According to the publication, the seller's Bitcoin wallet recorded 45 transactions that accumulated a little over $21,000 worth of cryptocurrency (BTC 0.60222754) at the time of the check. CyberNews says that they contacted MyFreeCams for a statement and received confirmation that the database is genuine.

SurveyLama is an online platform that rewards registered users for completing surveys. Owned by French firm Globe Media, the platform is praised for high payouts (up to $20), fast payments, and multiple withdrawal options. In early February, HIBP's creator, Troy Hunt, received information about a data breach impacting the service, which involved various data types, including: Hunt told BleepingComputer that he was notified of the exposure by one of the impacted users and independently verified the data. When contacted by HIBP inquiring about the authenticity of the data, SurveyLama said that they had already notified impacted users via email, confirming the security incident. The data set contains information about 4,426,879 accounts and was added to HIBP yesterday, so impacted users should have already received an email notification. The platform said the exposed passwords were stored either in salted SHA-1, bcrypt, or argon2 hashes form, so they are not in directly usable cleartext. Though hashing adds some resistance to cracking, it is not impervious to brute-forcing, especially the passwords protected with salted SHA-1, which carries known vulnerabilities, making it susceptible to collision attacks. That said, SurveyLama account holders should reset their passwords on the service immediately and on other platforms where they might use the same credentials. Hunt told BleepingComputer he was not aware that the compromised data had been posted anywhere publicly, making the exposure currently limited. However, if the dataset has fallen into the wrong hands, it could be exploited privately and then eventually leaked to the broader cybercrime community, so users must take protective measures as soon as possible.

In a letter sent to customers earlier this month, Macy's says ""cyberthreat alert tools"" warned it about ""suspicious login activities"" surrounding some Macy's online accounts. ""Based on our investigation,"" the company said, ""we believe that an unauthorized third party, from approximately April 26, 2018 through June 12, 2018, used valid customer user names and passwords to login to customer online profiles."" ""After logging into a macys.com online profile, the unauthorized party was able to access the following information available in the profile: First and Last Name; Full Address; Phone Number; Email Address; Birthday (Month & Day only) and Debit or Credit Card Number with expiration dates,"" Macy's said. Card CVV numbers and Social Security numbers were not exposed, Macy's said. But while the letter warns of a breach of macys.com accounts, in a statement to Bleeping Computer , the company said that some bloomingdales.com accounts were also affected. The store chain played down the incident and said the security breach involved only a small number of customer accounts. ""This affected only one-half of one percent of our logged in customers,"" a Macy's spokesperson told us. Macy's also claims the breach is not of its fault but happened because the hacker(s) obtained customer usernames and passwords from another source. The department store chain says it locked access to all accounts with a suspicious login activity, and users won't be able to access these accounts unless they reset their password. Users with locked accounts also received a snail mail letter about the incident. A copy of this letter, obtained by Bleeping Computer , is available here . The hacks of Macy's profiles didn't go unnoticed, as some users reported issues with their accounts' settings, while others reported that hacker(s) tried to purchase products using their accounts. @Macys @Bloomingdales Another data breach today??

Home Depot is the largest home improvement retailer, with more than 2,300 stores in North America and over 475,000 employees. On Thursday, a threat actor known as IntelBroker leaked limited data for approximately 10,000 Home Depot employees on a hacking forum. ""In April 2024, Home Depot suffered a data breach that exposed the corporate information belonging to 10K employees of the company,"" reads the forum post. After BleepingComputer contacted Home Depot, the company confirmed that one of its third-party SaaS vendors mistakenly exposed sample employee data. ""A third-party Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) vendor inadvertently made public a small sample of Home Depot associates' names, work email addresses and User IDs during testing of their systems,"" Home Depot told BleepingComputer. While this data is not highly sensitive, exposing only corporate IDs, names, and email addresses, it could be used by threat actors to conduct targeted phishing attacks against Home Depot employees. These phishing attacks could be designed to gather more sensitive information, such as Home Depot credentials, which could then be sold to other threat actors or used to breach the company's network to steal corporate data or deploy ransomware. For this reason, all Home Depot employees should be wary of any emails containing links to pages that request corporate credentials or other information. If one of these emails is received, it should be reported to the company's IT staff, who can verify whether it is legitimate. ​IntelBroker is a well-known threat actor who first gained notoriety by breaching DC Health Link , an organization that administers the health care plans of U.S. House members, their staff, and their families.

Casio detected the incident on Wednesday, October 11, following the failure of a ClassPad database within the company's development environment. Evidence suggests that the attacker accessed customers' personal information a day later, on October 12. The exposed data includes customer names, email addresses, countries of residence, service usage details, and purchase information such as payment methods, license codes, and order specifics. Casio says that credit card information was not stored within the compromised database. As of October 18, the attackers accessed 91,921 items belonging to Japanese customers (including individuals and 1,108 educational institution customers) and 35,049 records belonging to customers from 148 countries and regions outside Japan. ""At this time, it has been confirmed that some of the network security settings in the development environment were disabled due to an operational error of the system by the department in charge and insufficient operational management,"" the company said . ""Casio believes these were the causes of the situation that allowed an external party to gain unauthorized access."" Although the compromised database is currently ""inaccessible to external entities,"" the ClassPad.net app remains operational. Casio clarified that the hackers did not infiltrate systems beyond the compromised database within the development environment. On Monday, October 16, Casio reported the incident to Japan's Personal Information Protection Commission and is collaborating with law enforcement authorities, assisting with their breach investigation. Additionally, Casio is working with external cybersecurity and forensics experts to conduct an internal investigation to find the underlying causes of the incident and draw up countermeasures in response to the breach. In early August, a threat actor (known as thrax) claimed to have leaked over 1.2 million user records on the BreachForums cybercrime forum, allegedly stolen from a Remote Desktop Services (RDS) server with older casio.com databases. ​The allegedly stolen information contains entries up to July 2011, AWS keys, and database credentials.

End-user cybersecurity errors that can cost you millions,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/end-user-cybersecurity-errors-that-can-cost-you-millions/#comment_form,Home,"July 22, 2024","In today’s fast-paced organizations, end-users will sometimes try to take a shortcut. We've all been there — rushing to meet a deadline, juggling multiple tasks, or just trying to be helpful. But the reality is that letting even well-intentioned actions can come back to bite you. Picture this: an employee innocently lets a family member use their work laptop at home, thinking, ""What's the harm?"" But unbeknownst to them, their loved one accidentally downloads malware that spreads through your company's network, wreaking havoc on sensitive data and critical systems. Suddenly, that minor favor has morphed into a multimillion-dollar nightmare. It's not just a hypothetical scenario. The World Economic Forum has found that 95% of all cybersecurity incidents can be traced back to human error. Despite all the cutting-edge security technologies and ironclad protocols, the unintentional missteps of well-meaning end-users often open the door to disaster. And the cost of these blunders? According to IBM , the average global cost of a data breach in 2023 hit a staggering USD 4.45 million, a 15% increase over the past three years. That's not just a financial blow; it's a potentially business-ending event. To better understand the risks, we can examine five of the most frequent cybersecurity blunders committed by well-meaning employees. 1. Allowing unauthorized device access Proofpoint's User Risk Security Report reveals that half of working adults let friends and family members use their work devices at home. It seems harmless enough, but those loved ones could stumble upon sensitive company data or unwittingly access unsafe websites and applications. And if the unauthorized user downloads malware? Cybercriminals could gain access to corporate data, cloud applications, and storage, opening up a Pandora's box of security risks, including data breaches, intellectual property theft, and reputational damage. To address this risk, you should implement strict security controls, like password protection and two-factor authentication, and drill the importance of device sanctity into your employees' minds. A one-time onboarding security training won’t cut it; instead, introduce a comprehensive information security plan that all employees must follow and encourage team leaders to enforce cybersecurity discipline within their teams. 2. Misdelivery of sensitive information Imagine one of your end-users accidentally sending an email packed with confidential data to the wrong recipient. This is something that happens more often than you'd think, especially in industries like healthcare, where misdelivery is the most common error leading to a data breach. To prevent these mix-ups, consider requiring encryption for sensitive emails, implementing pop-up reminders for double-checking addresses, and deploying data loss prevention solutions that act as a safety net. You can have an effective password policy in place, but if your employees are reusing their passwords on less-secure personal devices, websites, and applications, then they’re still leaving the door wide open for cybercriminals. While there’s no 100% foolproof way to stop end-users from making the mistake of reusing passwords, solutions like Specops Password Policy can at least help you know if their passwords have become compromised. The solution continuously checks your Active Directory against a database of more than 4 billion unique breached passwords, alerting users to change if their found to be using a compromised password. 4. Exposing remote interfaces Remote work has also introduced a new set of challenges. IT teams often need to perform remote management tasks, but exposing administrative interfaces to the internet is like handing the keys to your kingdom to anyone with a Wi-Fi connection. To allow remote access without opening your virtual front door, you must be selective about what you expose online. Additionally, employing automated maintenance solutions will help you minimize vulnerabilities and risks. 5. Misusing privileged accounts It’s important to remember that your IT employees are humans, too, and they may take risks they know they shouldn’t. For example, it’s tempting for an IT admin to work from their privileged account even if they’re just handling everyday IT tasks — it’s convenient, and it keeps them from having to switch back and forth between their admin and user account. But that convenience comes at a steep price; if their admin account gets compromised, it's a major risk. The safest bet? Separate user accounts with limited privileges for daily work, reserving admin powers for critical tasks only. Implement the principle of least privilege (PoLP), ensuring that employees only have access to the resources and permissions necessary to perform their specific job functions. And regularly review and audit user permissions, revoking any unnecessary privileges promptly. In the end, cybersecurity is a team sport. No matter how robust your technical defenses are, your people are often the first line of defense — and your weakest link. By understanding the common pitfalls and implementing smart policies and training, you can transform your workforce from liability to asset in the battle against cyber threats. After all, when protecting your business, an ounce of prevention is worth millions in cure. Interested to know how many open risks could be lurking within your Active Directory?

Besides exfiltrating data including students' names, dates of birth, and email addresses after exploiting a critical flaw affecting the AIMSweb1.0 web-based software used by Pearson for tracking students' academic performance, the Chinese hackers also stole millions of rows of student data and easily crackable credentials ""scrambled"" using an outdated algorithm. ""As the order finds, Pearson opted not to disclose this breach to investors until it was contacted by the media, and even then Pearson understated the nature and scope of the incident, and overstated the company's data protections,"" said Kristina Littman, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit. ""As public companies face the growing threat of cyber intrusions, they must provide accurate information to investors about material cyber incidents."" The company shared with the SEC in July 2019 that it could face the risk of a data privacy incident. Still, it did not disclose that it suffered a data breach one year earlier even though the risk factor disclosure sent to the SEC was filed after notifying affected customers of the incident. Several days later, Pearson also issued a previously prepared media statement only after a media outlet reached out for details, which tried to downplay the actual extent of the data breach. ""In its July 26, 2019 report furnished to the Commission, Pearson’s risk factor disclosure implied that Pearson faced the hypothetical risk that a 'data privacy incident' 'could result in a major data privacy or confidentiality breach' but did not disclose that Pearson had in fact already experienced such a data breach,"" the SEC explains in the order issued today. ""On July 31, 2019, approximately two weeks after Pearson sent a breach notification to affected customers, in response to an inquiry by a national media outlet, Pearson issued a previously-prepared media statement that also made misstatements about the nature of the breach and the number of rows and type of data involved."" According to SEC's press release , Pearson also said it had ""strict protections"" to defend its customers' data even though the education giant failed to patch the critical vulnerability that led to the breach at least six months after being alerted that a AIMSweb1.0 security update is available.

The allegations were published yesterday by a threat actor named ""grep,"" who alleges that the computing vendor suffered a ""minor data breach"" in September 2024, exposing internal employee and partner information. In a post to a hacking forum, the threat actor says the stolen data includes employees' unique identifiers, full names of employees for Dell and partners, status of employees (active or not), and an internal identification string. Though only a small sample of the data was shared for free, a link to the entire database can be revealed by spending 1 BreachForums credit, valued at approximately $0.30. Responding to a request for a comment on the threat actor's post, the computer giant told BleepingComputer that they are investigating the claims. ""We are aware of the claims and our security team is currently investigating,"" Dell told BleepingComputer. It is worth noting that the same user, grep, claimed another high-profile data breach on September 9, 2024, when he posted data allegedly stolen from the French IT giant Capgemini. The threat actor alleged to hold 20 GB of data, including source code, credentials, private keys, API keys, employee data, T-Mobile virtual machine logs, documents, and more, which was leaked for free. BleepingComputer contacted Capgemini at the time to ask about grep's claims but did not receive a reply.

LA County Health Services: Patients' data exposed in phishing attack,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/la-county-health-services-thousands-of-patients-data-exposed-in-email-breach/,Sergiu Gatlan,"April 25, 2024","​The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services disclosed a data breach after thousands of patients' personal and health information was exposed in a data breach resulting from a recent phishing attack impacting over two dozen employees. This integrated health system operates the public hospitals and clinics in L.A. County (the most populous county in the United States) and is the second largest public health care system in the country after NYC Health + Hospitals. As revealed in data breach notifications sent to potentially affected individuals, 23 employees had their mailboxes compromised after their credentials were stolen in a February attack. As a result, the attackers gained access to patients' personal and health data stored in the employees' e-mail inboxes. ""DHS conducted an administrative review and determined that approximately 6,085 individuals' information may have been impacted,"" L.A. County Health Services told BleepingComputer in a statement. ""Between February 19, 2024, and February 20, 2024, DHS experienced a phishing attack. Specifically, a hacker was able to gain log-in credentials of 23 DHS employees through a phishing e-mail,"" the notifications also revealed. ""In this case, the DHS employees clicked on the link located in the body of the e-mail, thinking that they were accessing a legitimate message from a trustworthy sender."" Documents and e-mails in the compromised mailboxes included a combination of patients' personal and health information, including: Affected individuals may have been impacted differently, and the data stored in the breached e-mail inboxes did not include Social Security Numbers (SSNs) or financial information. After discovering the breach, L.A. County Health Services disabled the impacted e-mail accounts, reset and re-imaged the compromised employees' devices, and quarantined all suspicious incoming e-mails. It also circulated awareness notifications to all employees, reminding them to always be vigilant when reviewing e-mails, especially those with attachments or links. The health system will also notify the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services' Office for Civil Rights, the California Department of Public Health, and other relevant agencies of the data breach. Additionally, even though no evidence was found during the investigation that the attackers accessed or misused the exposed personal and health information, L.A. County Health Services advises affected patients to contact their healthcare providers to verify the content and accuracy of their medical records. Update April 26, 05:20 EDT: Added L.A.

Utah medical center hit by data breach affecting 582k patients,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/utah-medical-center-hit-by-data-breach-affecting-582k-patients/#comment_form,Bill Toulas,"November 19, 2021","Utah Imaging Associates (UIA), a Utah-based radiology center, has announced a data breach affecting 582,170 people after their personal information was exposed. According to the data breach notification sent to affected individuals, the security incident was discovered on September 4, 2021, and was remediated on the same day. However, the initial network infiltration happened on August 29, 2021, allowing the threat actors to explore UIA's internal systems and potentially steal data for about a week. The subsequent forensic investigation carried out with the help of a specialized third-party cybersecurity firm revealed that the unauthorized network intruder had access to the following personal information of patients: The type of information varies by individual, so not all of the above elements concern each recipient of the data breach notice. UIA also points out that they have received no reports of this data having been leaked online, two months after the incident. This, however, doesn't guarantee that any stolen data isn't privately shared among hackers on the dark web, as is commonly done with data breaches. People who used UIA's services in the past should take advantage of the offered 12 months of credit monitoring services through IDX and remain vigilant against social engineering attacks. If you have noticed signs of fraud, unusual bank account charges, or suspicious emails and calls, you are advised to report it immediately by calling (833) 525-2720. BleepingComputer has contacted UIA to learn more about the nature of the data breach, and we will update this post as soon as we have more details. Hackers tend to target medical centers like UIA as they handle sensitive data considered valuable in the cybercrime underground. Some notable recent incidents targeting healthcare include: As healthcare visits require patients to provide a lot of personal information, the responsibility of securing their sensitive data can be difficult for healthcare providers. This is especially true for smaller practices that may operate under a limited budget without a dedicated IT staff. All businesses, including medical practices, should safeguard their data by not exposing internal services to the Internet, such as remote desktop, following good backup schedules, and conducting phishing training for their employees.

Cox discloses data breach after hacker impersonates support agent,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cox-discloses-data-breach-after-hacker-impersonates-support-agent/#comment_form,Lawrence Abrams,"December 9, 2021","Cox Communications has disclosed a data breach after a hacker impersonated a support agent to gain access to customers' personal information. Cox Communications, aka Cox Cable, is a digital cable provider and telecommunication company that provides internet, television, and phone services in the USA. This week, customers began receiving letters in the mail disclosing that Cox Communications learned on October 11th, 2021, that ""unknown person(s)"" impersonated a Cox support agent to access customer information. There are not a lot of details about the security incident, but the hacker likely used a social engineering attack to gain access to Cox internal systems that provided information about customers. ""On October 11, 2021, Cox learned that an unknown person(s) had impersonated a Cox agent and gained access to a small number of customer accounts. We immediately launched an internal investigation, took steps to secure the affected customer accounts, and notified law enforcement of the incident,"" reads the data breach notification signed from Amber Hall, Chief Compliance and Privacy Officer of Cox Communications. ""After further investigation, we discover that the unknown person(s) may have viewed certain types of information that are maintained in your Cox customer account, including your name, address, telephone number, Cox account number, Cox.net email address, username, PIN code, account security question and answer, and/or the types of services that you receive from Cox."" In summary, the data breach exposed the following sensitive information for affected customers: While Cox does not state that financial information or passwords were accessed, they are advising affected customers to monitor their financial accounts and to change passwords on other accounts using the same one as the Cox customer account. Cox is offering affected customers a free one-year Experian IdentityWorks that can be used to monitor credit reports and detect signs of fraudulent activity. In a statement to BleepingComputer, Cox said that they have reported the incident to law enforcement and that it only affected a small number of customers. ""The security of the services we provide to customers is a top priority. A recent security incident impacted a small number of customer accounts. We promptly launched an investigation and took steps to secure the affected accounts and have implemented additional security controls to further safeguard their information. We are working with law enforcement and have notified all impacted customers."" - Cox. When we asked further questions regarding the number of affected customers and how the breach took place, we did not receive a response. Media conglomerate Cox Media Group suffered a ransomware attack in June 2021 that took down live TV and radio broadcast streams. The ransomware attack and this incident do not appear to be related. If you are affected by this data breach or are simply concerned about the safety of your Cox account, you should perform the following steps: Once again, while Cox did not disclose that financial information was accessed by the threat actor, due to the amount of data exposed, all affected customers should monitor their credit reports for unusual activity.

In a data breach notification filed with the Vermont attorney general's office, USCellular states that retail store's employees were scammed into downloading software onto a computer. This software allowed an attacker to access the computer remotely, and as the employee was logged into the customer relationship management (CRM), they gained access to that as well. ""On January 6, 2021, we detected a data security incident in which unauth0rized individuals may have gained access to your wireless customer account and wireless phne number. A few employees in retail stores were successfully scammed by unauthorized individuals and downloaded software onto a store computer."" ""Since the employee was already logged into the customer retail management (""CRM"") system, the downloaded software allowed the unauthorized individual to remotely access the store computer and enter the CRM system under the employee's credentials,"" states the USCellular data breach notification . USCellular believes the attack occurred on January 4th, 2021. It is not clear from the notification how many customers were affected and whether the employees were scammed via a phishing email or another method. While viewing a customers' account in the CRM, the threat actor would have been able to see their name, address, PIN, cell phone numbers, service plan, and billing/usage statements. ""As indicated above, your customer account was impacted in this incident. Information your customer account includes your name, address, PIN c0de, and cellular telephone numbers(s) as well as information about your wireless services including your service plan, usage and billing statements known as Customer Proprietary Network Information (""CPNI""),"" the data breach notification continues. USCelluar states that customers' social security numbers and credit card information were not accessible as they are masked in the CRM. In a now deleted data breach notification [ archived copy ] posted to USCellular's site, the mobile carrier also stated that the attackers were able to port numbers for affected customers to another carrier. After porting the numbers, threat actors could have used it in additional attacks, such as phishing, to gain access to 2-factor authentication codes sent via text message. After learning of the attack, USCellular isolated the infected computer and reset the employee's passwords. The company also reset impacted customers' and authorized contact's PIN and security questions/answers, which can be set up again by contacting USCellular. Affected customers should be on the lookout for targeted phishing scams utilizing information stolen from the CRM.

AT&T denies data breach after hacker auctions 70 million user database,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/atandt-denies-data-breach-after-hacker-auctions-70-million-user-database/,Lawrence Abrams,"August 20, 2021","AT&T says that they did not suffer a data breach after a well-known threat actor claimed to be selling a database containing the personal information of 70 million customers. The threat actor, known as ShinyHunters, began selling this database yesterday on a hacking forum with a starting price of $200,000 and incremental offers of $30,000. The hacker states that they are willing to sell it immediately for $1 million. From the samples shared by the threat actor, the database contains customers' names, addresses, phone numbers, Social Security numbers, and date of birth. A security researcher who wishes to remain anonymous told BleepingComputer that two of the four people in the samples were confirmed to have accounts on att.com. Other than these few details, not much is known about the database, how it was acquired, and whether it is authentic. However, ShinyHunters is a well-known threat actor with a long history of compromising websites and developer repositories to steal credentials or API keys. This authentication is then used to steal databases, which they then sell directly to other threat actors or utilize a middle-man data breach seller. In many cases, when a database is not sold, ShinyHunters will release it for free on hacker forums. In the past, ShinyHunters has breached numerous companies, including Wattpad , Tokopedia , Microsoft's GitHub account , BigBasket , Nitro PDF , Pixlr , TeeSpring , Promo.com , Mathway , and many more . After learning of the threat actor's claims, BleepingComputer reached out to AT&T to see if the data belonged to them. In multiple emails, AT&T has told BleepingComputer that the data is not from their systems and has not recently been breached. ""Based on our investigation today, the information that appeared in an internet chat room does not appear to have come from our systems."" - AT&T. When asked whether the data may have come from a third-party partner, AT&T chose not to speculate. ""Given this information did not come from us, we can't speculate on where it came from or whether it is valid,"" AT&T told us in a follow-up email. ShinyHunters has told BleepingComputer that they are not surprised that AT&T denies the breach and continues to state that it comes from them. ""I don't care if they don't admit. I'm just selling,"" ShinyHunters told BleepingComputer. While ShinyHunters states that they did not contact AT&T, they said they are willing to ""negotiate"" with the company. When we asked the threat actor for further information about the breach, ShinyHunters refused to provide any other details. This news comes soon after a different threat actor tried to sell the stolen data of 100 million T-Mobile customers . T-Mobile latest confirmed they were hacked, and the cyberattack exposed the personal data of 48 million T-Mobile customers .

"Europcar denies data breach of 50 million users, says data is fake",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/europcar-denies-data-breach-of-50-million-users-says-data-is-fake/,Lawrence Abrams,"January 31, 2024","Car rental company Europcar says it has not suffered a data breach and that shared customer data is fake after a threat actor claimed to be selling the personal info of 50 million customers. On Sunday, a person claimed to be selling the data for 48,606,700 Europcar.com customers on a popular hacking forum. The post included samples of the stolen data for 31 alleged Europcar customers, including names, addresses, birth dates, driver's license numbers, and other information. However, after contacting Europcar last night, BleepingComputer was told that the breach was fake and that the data was fabricated using artificial intelligence. ""After being notified by a threat intel service that an account pretends to sell Europcar data on the dark net and thoroughly checking the data contained in the sample, we are confident that this advertisement is false: - the number of records is completely wrong & inconsistent with ours, - the sample data is likely ChatGPT-generated (addresses don't exist, ZIP codes don't match, first name and last name don't match email addresses, email addresses use very unusual TLDs), - and most importantly: none of these email addresses are present in our database."" As Have I Been Pwned's Troy Hunt explains, while much of the data is clearly fake, he does not believe it was created using artificial intelligence. Hunt pointed out that the email addresses do not match the usernames. For example, all usernames contain either a first or last name, but none match the full name listed in the data. The second indicator that the data is fake is that the addresses simply do not exist. For example, two of the listed customer records use the non-existent towns of ""Lake Alyssaberg, DC"" and ""West Paulburgh, PA."" Another indicator is that the addresses and phone numbers are for regions in the U.S., yet many of the associated emails are for other countries. While Europcar told BleepingComputer they believe this data was created using AI, Hunt points out that some of the email addresses are real, appearing in previous data breaches monitored by Have I Been Pwned. Instead, Hunt believes the mention of artificial intelligence is just a hot take based on the subject's popularity and was not involved in creating this data. ""We've had fabricated breaches since forever because people want airtime or to make a name for themselves or maybe a quick buck,"" explains Hunt . ""Who knows, it doesn't matter, because none of that makes it ""AI"" and seeking out headlines or sending spam pitches on that basis is just plain dumb."" As pointed out by security researcher NexusFuzzy , there are existing projects that allow anyone to create data that looks almost exactly like what was shared in the fake data breach samples. While threat actors already use artificial intelligence as part of their scams and attacks, and will likely expand its use in the future , this incident does not appear to be one of them.

In a press statement released yesterday, the mobile carrier updated the information regarding the personal data of 9.8 million customers exposed during the attack. In an investigation, Optus confirmed that a total of 2.1 million customers had valid or expired ID document numbers exposed to the hackers. Of these 2.1 million customers, 1.2 million had at least one number from a current and valid form of identification compromised, and 900,000 had ID numbers exposed but from documents that are now expired. ""Today's update helps provide more clarity for our customers,"" reads the press statement . ""Having worked with government agencies to meticulously analyse the data for the company's 9.8 million customers, Optus can confirm the exposed information did not contain valid or current document ID numbers for some 7.7 million customers."" However, all 9.8 million customers had other personal information exposed, including email addresses, date of birth, or phone numbers. Optus has sent SMS text messages to customers whose ID numbers were compromised in the cyberattack with information on their next steps. Customers whose driver's license details were compromised can request a new driver's license number to prevent identity theft or fraudulent activity. The threat actor had initially attempted to extort Optus with a $1 million ransom demand not to publish or sell the stolen data. After not receiving a payment, the hacker leaked the data of 10,000 customers on a hacking forum that included names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, and dates of birth. A few days later, feeling the pressure of law enforcement, the hacker apologized to Optus and its customers and claimed to have deleted all of the stolen data. However, as there is no way to determine if the hacker actually deleted the data, all Optus users should assume that threat actors may use their data in future fraud or phishing attacks. Therefore, it is strongly advised to be wary of any emails claiming to be from Optus asking you to provide further information or login into your account. If you receive an email or SMS text claiming from Optus, directly log in to the company's site and review any messages there.

Broward Health is a Florida-based healthcare system with over thirty locations offering a wide range of medical services and receives over 60,000 admissions per year. The healthcare system disclosed a cyberattack on October 15, 2021, when an intruder gained unauthorized access to the hospital's network and patient data. The organization discovered the intrusion four days later, on October 19, and immediately notified the FBI and the US Department of Justice. At the same time, all employees were advised to change their user passwords, and Broward Health contracted a third-party cybersecurity expert to help with the investigations. An investigation revealed that the threat actors gained access to patient's personal medical information, which may include the following items: Although Broward Health confirms that the network intruder has exfiltrated the above data, it notes that there is no evidence that the threat actors misused it. Notably, the intrusion point was determined to be a third-party medical provider who was permitted access to the system to provide their services. ""In response to this incident, Broward Health is taking steps to prevent recurrence of similar incidents, which include the ongoing investigation, a password reset with enhanced security measures across the enterprise, and the implementation of multifactor authentication for all users of its systems,"" explains the data breach notificaiton to affected patients and employees. ""We have also begun implementation of additional minimum-security requirements for devices that are not managed by Broward Health Information Technology that access our network, which will become effective in January 2022.""

Blackbaud is a leading provider of software solutions catering to nonprofit organizations, such as charities, schools, and healthcare agencies, and it specializes in donor engagement and management of constituency data. This data includes a wide array of sensitive information such as demographic details, Social Security numbers, driver's license numbers, financial records, employment data, wealth information, donation histories, and protected health information. In the breach disclosed by Blackbaud in July 2020, the highly sensitive data belonging to over 13,000 Blackbaud business customers and their clients from the U.S., Canada, the U.K., and the Netherlands was compromised, impacting millions of individuals. The attackers stole customers' unencrypted banking information, login credentials, and social security numbers. Blackbaud complied with the attackers' demand for ransom after being told that all the stolen data was destroyed. This week's $49.5 million settlement addresses allegations of Blackbaud violating state consumer protection laws, breach-notification regulations, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). ""Carelessness cannot justify the compromise of consumer data. Companies must be committed to safeguarding personal information, meeting consumers' rightful expectations of data privacy and protection,"" said Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost. As part of the settlement, Blackbaud also has to: In its 2020 Q3 Quarterly report, the company revealed three years ago that at least 43 state Attorneys Generals and the District of Columbia were looking into the incident. By November 2020, Blackbaud had already been sued in 23 proposed consumer class action cases related to the May 2020 security breach in the U.S. and Canada. In March, the company also agreed to pay $3 million to settle charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), alleging that it failed to disclose the full impact of the 2020 ransomware attack. According to the SEC, Blackbaud's technology and customer relations personnel discovered the attackers stole donor bank account information and social security numbers. However, they didn't escalate the matter to management due to the company's lack of appropriate disclosure controls and procedures. Subsequently, Blackbaud submitted an SEC report omitting crucial details about the full scope of the breach. Additionally, the report downplayed the potential risk associated with sensitive donor information accessed by the attackers, describing it as hypothetical. It's budget season!

Comcast and Truist Bank customers caught up in FBCS data breach,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/comcast-and-truist-bank-customers-caught-up-in-fbcs-data-breach/,Bill Toulas,"October 6, 2024","Comcast Cable Communications and Truist Bank have disclosed they were impacted by a data breach at FBCS, and are now informing their respective customers that their data has been compromised. The case concerns a data breach at Financial Business and Consumer Solutions (FBCS), a debt collection agency in the U.S. that partners with various companies to collect unpaid debts on their behalf. Last April this year, FBCS informed of a data breach determined to have occurred between February 14 and February 26, 2024, when threat actors breached its network and stole the following details from its electronic records: The data breach was initially believed to have impacted 1.9 million people , but subsequent findings upped the tally to 3.2 million in June and, finally, 4.2 million individuals in July. The internal investigation into the incident appears to be ongoing, as FBCS recently informed additional entities that they had been impacted, including Comcast and Truist. Also, it is now made known that due to FBCS's worsening financial position, presumably a direct result of the breach, entities indirectly impacted by the incident will have to undertake the notification and remediation processes themselves. Comcast says FBCS assured them in March that the security incident impacted no customer data. However, on July 17, FBCS notified Comcast that its customer data was also impacted. According to a notice submitted to the Maine authorities , 273,703 Comcast customers were impacted by the breach. ""FBCS's investigation discovered that files downloaded by the unauthorized party included your name, address, Social Security number, date of birth, and your Comcast account number and ID numbers used internally at FBCS,"" reads the notification sent to impacted customers . ""FBCS states that it has no indication that any personal information compromised during this incident has been further misused."" Impacted people were given 12 months of free-of-charge identity theft protection services, with activation instructions enclosed. In related news, Truist Bank, one of the largest banks in the United States, also sent notices of a data breach to its customers linked to the FBCS incident. The letters were sent out in mid-September, but a sample was submitted more recently to the Californian authorities. ""FBCS has indicated that the type of information that may have been impacted varies per person and may include consumer name, address, account number, date of birth and Social Security number,"" disclosed Truist Bank. Truist operates over 2,700 branches across 15 states and employs 40,000 people. As such, the number of impacted people could be significant, though it has not been specified. BleepingComputer emailed Truist to learn how many of its customers were impacted by this incident, but a comment wasn't immediately available. Meanwhile, last June, Truist Bank confirmed a separate breach that reportedly occurred in October 2023 after a threat actor leaked stolen data on a hacking forum.

"Popular stock photo service hit by data breach, 8.3M records for sale",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/popular-stock-photo-service-hit-by-data-breach-83m-records-for-sale/,Lawrence Abrams,"November 12, 2020","Stock photo site 123RF has suffered a data breach after a hacker began selling a database containing 8.3 million user records on a hacker forum. 123RF is a popular stock photo and vector site that sells royalty-free images, videos, and audio to be used on websites, printed content, and videos. According to SimilarWeb , 123RF receives over 26 million visitors per month. Over the past weekend, a known data breach broker began selling a database containing 8.3 million user records stolen from 123RF.com during a data breach. From the samples of the database seen by BleepingComputer, the stolen data includes a 123RF members' full name, email address, MD5 hashed passwords, company name, phone number, address, PayPal email if used, and IP address. There is no financial information stored in the database. After emailing 123RF earlier this week, BleepingComputer received an email from Inmagine Group, the owner of 123RF, stating that a server located at their data center was breached and the hackers ""proceeded to copy the membership data."" Based on the site of the sold database, Inmagine Group states that the database is likely outdated and is not the latest version from 2020. In the samples seen by BleepingComputer, the newest record date is from October 27th, 2019. While the company states that the passwords are encrypted, the passwords are MD5 hashes. Unfortunately, using online MD5 cracking tools, BleepingComputer could easily retrieve the plain-text passwords for numerous accounts. Inmagine Group states that they are working with law enforcement and have begun notifying affected 123RF members. ""We are actively notifying the necessary authorities and 123RF.com members to work with them to remedy the situation. We are also tightening the security policies to include tighter passwords and IP detection to combat suspicious log-ins."" ""Our security infrastructure is always under a constant state of security testing, penetration and development, especially in the past year."" ""We wish to reiterate that we take the privacy and data of our customers seriously and have at all times been vigilant with the handling of our customer’s data,"" Inmagine Group shared with BleepingComputer. While the passwords leaked in this data breach were hashed, as explained, it is possible to crack the stolen passwords using brute force tools, word lists, and even online dehashing sites. After a user's password is cracked, threat actors would be able to use them to log in to other sites you may have an account. Therefore, if you are a 123RF customer, you should immediately change your password to a strong and unique one. If that same password was used at another site, you should change it at any other site that also uses it. When changing your passwords, be sure to use a unique and strong password at every site so that a data breach does not affect your account at other companies. A password manager can make it much easier to use unique passwords at every site and is highly recommended. It's budget season!

UK Labour Party discloses data breach after ransomware attack,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/uk-labour-party-discloses-data-breach-after-ransomware-attack/#comment_form,Sergiu Gatlan,"November 3, 2021","The UK Labour Party notified members that some of their information was impacted in a data breach after a ransomware attack hit a supplier managing the party's data. The data breach was announced in a data breach notification published on the party's website after informing relevant authorities about the incident. ""On 29 October 2021, we were informed of the cyber incident by the third party. The third party told us that the incident had resulted in a significant quantity of Party data being rendered inaccessible on their systems,"" the breach notice reads . ""As soon as the Party was notified of these matters, we engaged third-party experts and the incident was immediately reported to the relevant authorities, including the National Crime Agency (NCA), National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO)."" Data involved in the incident includes information provided by members, registered and affiliated supporters, and others who have provided their info to the Party. The incident is still being investigated, and the full scope and impact of the data breach are yet unknown. The Labour Party advises members potentially affected by this incident to be vigilant when answering suspicious emails, phone calls, or text messages, as well as enable two-factor authentication (2FA) where possible to protect their online accounts. While the U.K. party did not disclose the nature of the incident, sources close to the investigation told Sky News that the attack involved ransomware being deployed on the third-party supplier's systems containing Labour Party data. The Party takes the security of all personal information for which it is responsible very seriously. It is doing everything within its power to investigate and address this incident in close liaison with law enforcement, the Information Commissioner's Office, and the affected third party. - Labour Party The Labour Party disclosed another data breach following a similar incident last year, in July, after leading cloud software provider Blackbaud and of the party's suppliers was hit by a ransomware attack in May 2020 and disclosed on July 16 . As the party revealed at the time, the breach included members' names, email addresses, phone numbers, and amounts donated. While the party said immediately after the breach that no sensitive data like bank account information, passwords, or usernames were exposed, Blackbaud's forensic investigation revealed that the threat actors had access to unencrypted banking info, credentials, and SSNs. ""After July 16, further forensic investigation found that for some of the notified customers, the cybercriminal may have accessed some unencrypted fields intended for bank account information, social security numbers, usernames and/or passwords,"" Blackbaud said in an 8-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Advance Auto Parts data breach impacts 2.3 million people,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/advance-auto-parts-data-breach-impacts-23-million-people/,Bill Toulas,"July 11, 2024","Advance Auto Parts is sending data breach notifications to over 2.3 million people whose personal data was stolen in recent Snowflake data theft attacks. Advance operates 4,777 stores and 320 Worldpac branches, serving 1,152 independently owned Carquest stores in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Mexico, and various Caribbean islands. On June 5, 2024, a threat actor known as 'Sp1d3r' began selling a massive 3TB database allegedly containing 380 million Advance customer records, orders, transaction details, and other sensitive information. On June 19, the company confirmed the breach via a Form 8-K filing but said it only impacts current and former employees and job applicants. The incident was part of a broader campaign targeting Snowflake accounts using stolen credentials, which impacted Pure Storage , Los Angeles Unified , Neiman Marcus , Ticketmaster , and Banco Santander . Advance has completed its internal investigation into the incident and has determined that the data breach impacted 2,316,591 million people. According to the data breach notification samples shared with the authorities , the threat actors maintained unauthorized access to Advance's Snowflake environment for over a month, starting mid-April 2024. ""Our investigation determined that an unauthorized third party accessed or copied certain information maintained by Advance Auto Parts from April 14, 2024, to May 24, 2024,"" reads the notice . ""We conducted a detailed review and analysis of the affected information to determine the types of information contained therein and to whom the information relates."" The data stolen by the attackers includes full names, Social Security numbers (SSNs), driver's licenses, and government ID numbers. The company says it collects this information as part of its job application process, so the 2.3 million figure is related to job applicants and former/current employees whose data was stored in the compromised cloud database. Those impacted are given 12 months of complimentary identity theft protection and credit monitoring services through Experian, and they have until October 1, 2024, to enroll. Potentially impacted individuals are advised to be vigilant for unsolicited communications, monitor their accounts closely, activate fraud alerts, and consider placing a credit freeze. The 2.3 million figure reported by Advance is a far cry from the threat actor's allegations about 380M records, and the data types confirmed to have been exposed aren't nearly as extensive as what 'Sp1d3r' offered for sale. However, samples of the stolen data seen by BleepingComputer appear to have contained customer information, so it's possible they will be notified in the future. BleepingComputer contacted Advance Auto Parts to clarify whether customer information was exposed, but a comment wasn't immediately available. It's budget season!

Houzz Break-In: Data Breach Announced,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/houzz-break-in-data-breach-announced/#comment_form,Lawrence Abrams,"February 3, 2019","The home improvement site Houzz announced a data breach this week involving third-parties gaining access to a file that contains publicly visible user data as well as private account information. In an email sent to affected users, Houzz stated that an unauthorized third-party gained access to a file containing both publicly available information as well as internal account information such as user IDs, email address, one-way encrypted passwords, IP addresses, city and zip codes derived from IP addresses, and Facebook information. Based on the FAQ , it appears that Houzz's data was stolen at some point, but it is not known if it stolen through a hacked system, unsecured database or files, or by an employee. It was also not disclosed how this data was being used or if it was distributed or sold on underground hacking forums. All that we know is that in late December 2018, Houzz was told that a file containing their data was in the hands of third-parties and that they hired a forensics firm to determine how the data was stolen. According to the security notice, the file contained the following data: Houzz has stated that no payment information or social security numbers were part of this breach. ""Importantly, this incident does not involve Social Security numbers or payment card, bank account, or other financial information."" While payment information was not disclosed, email address and encrypted passwords were. Depending on the type of encryption used to encrypt the passwords, it is possible for attackers to decrypt them so that they can be used in other attacks. Armed with a decrypted password and an email address, attackers can use this information to try and login to other sites using the same credentials in what is a called a credential stuffing attack. If the user used the same login information at another site, then the attackers would be able to gain access to that site as well. Therefore, it is not only important for affected users to change their password at Houzz, but they should also change their passwords at other sites where they used the same one. It is also strongly recommended that password managers are used to create unique passwords at each site that an account is created. BleepingComputer has contacted Houzz for more information regarding this breach, but has not received a response by the time of this publication.

US cities disclose data breaches after vendor's ransomware attack,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-cities-disclose-data-breaches-after-vendors-ransomware-attack/,Lawrence Abrams,"February 18, 2021","A ransomware attack against the widely used payment processor ATFS has sparked data breach notifications from numerous cities and agencies within California and Washington. Automatic Funds Transfer Services (AFTS) is used by many cities and agencies in Washington and other US states as a payment processor and address verification service. As the data is used for billing and verifying customers and residents is wide and varied, this attack could have a massive and widespread impact. The attack occurred around February 3rd when a cybercrime gang known as 'Cuba ransomware' stole unencrypted files and deployed the ransomware. The cyberattack has since caused significant disruption to AFTS' business operations, making their website unavailable and impacting payment processing. When visiting their site, people are greeted with a message, stating, ""The website for AFTS and all related payment processing website are unavailable due to technical issues,"" as shown below. BleepingComputer discovered that the attack was conducted by a cybercrime operation known as 'Cuba Ransomware' after the hackers began selling AFTS' stolen data on their data leak site . Like other human-operated ransomware, Cuba will breach a network, spread slowly through servers while stealing network credentials and unencrypted files, and finally end the attack by deploying the ransomware to encrypt devices. According to the data leak page, the Cuba gang claims to have stolen ""financial documents, correspondence with bank employees, account movements, balance sheets, and tax documents."" If the ransomware gang cannot find a buyer for the data, they will likely release it for free, allowing the data to be used by other threat actors. Due to the large amount of potential data allegedly stolen by the Cuba Ransomware operation, cities utilizing AFTS as their payment processor or address verification service have begun disclosing potential data breaches. The potential data exposed varies depending on the city or agency, but may include names, addresses, phone numbers, license plate numbers, VIN numbers, credit card information, scanned paper checks, and billing details. Below we have listed the cities and agencies that have released data breach notification, with more likely to follow in the future. Automatic Funds Transfer Services, Inc. (AFTS) of Seattle was the victim of a ransomware attack in early February that may have compromised information provided to AFTS by the DMV, including the last 20 months of California vehicle registration records that contain names, addresses, license plate numbers and vehicle identification numbers (VIN). AFTS does not have access to DMV customers’ Social Security numbers, birthdates, voter registration, immigration status or driver’s license information, therefore this data was not compromised. The information stored in the AFTS databases is limited to data necessary to fulfill utility billing and payment processing of paper check payments. At this time, we have no knowledge that any personal information belonging to any Kirkland utility customers has been accessed or misused. However, AFTS is currently conducting an investigation to determine what personal information might have been accessed by the ransomware actors, if any, and will inform Kirkland of that information when it becomes available. We can confirm that ATFS’ database does not contain any of our customers’ social security numbers, dates of birth, driver’s license numbers, state ID numbers or credit card numbers. The City of Lynnwood contracts with AFTS to mail our printed utility statements to customers. Information that is included in the mailed statements includes the customer name, address, and utility account number. Lynnwood's information stored in the AFTS database is limited to data necessary to fulfill the printing and mailing of utility bills. Payment methods are processed by a different vendor who has not been impacted by this incident. The information stored in the AFTS databases is limited to data necessary to fulfill utility billing and payment processing of paper check payments. Electronic payments are processed by a different vendor who is not impacted by the incident. Potentially breached information from the AFTS database may have included the following personal information: utility bill account number, name, address, and billing amounts. Additionally, for residents or businesses who pay their utility bills by mailing a paper check, scanned copies of their paper checks are also stored on the AFTS servers which include bank account and routing information. It is unknown at this time whether these scanned copies of checks have been illicitly extricated from the network. The databases do not contain social security numbers, birth dates, driver’s license numbers, state ID numbers or any other Personally Identifiable Information (PII). The databases do not contain any resident or commercial business credit card information. Personal information may have been exposed including names and addresses of utility customers. The City of Redmond is working closely with AFTS to determine the extent of the breach and if any of the City’s information was compromised. The City of Seattle has recently learned that a third-party utility billing vendor, Automatic Funds Transfer Services, Inc. (AFTS), which is used by a small number of City departments, was the victim of a ransomware attack. City departments use this vendor for commercial billing, printing, and mailing services. The information stored in the AFTS databases is limited to data necessary to fulfill billing and payment processing of paper check payments. Electronic payments are processed by a different vendor who is not impacted by the incident. Breached information from the AFTS database may have included the following personal information: water bill account number, name, address, and billing amounts. Additionally, for residents or businesses who pay their utility bills by mailing a paper check, scanned copies of their paper checks are also stored on the AFTS servers which include bank account and routing information. It is unknown at this time whether these scanned copies of checks have been illicitly extricated from the network. We have no indication Port of Everett’s customers information has been compromised, but we wanted to make you immediately aware of the risk of potential exposure of your personal and/or credit information as soon as possible.

TransUnion suffers data breach impacting over 4.4 million people,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/transunion-suffers-data-breach-impacting-over-44-million-people/,Bill Toulas,"August 28, 2025","Update: Story updated with confirmation that this was another Salesforce data theft attack and the types of data stolen. Consumer credit reporting giant TransUnion warns it suffered a data breach exposing the personal information of over 4.4 million people in the United States, with BleepingComputer learning the data was stolen from it's Salesforce account. TransUnion is one of the three major credit bureaus in the United States, alongside Equifax and Experian. It operates in 30 countries, employs 13,000 staff, and has an annual revenue of $3 billion. It collects and maintains credit information on over 1 billion consumers worldwide, with approximately 200 million of those based in the U.S. This information is shared with 65,000 businesses, including lenders, insurers, and employers. According to a filing submitted to the Office of the Maine AG, the breach occurred on July 28, 2025, and was discovered two days later. A sample of the notifications distributed to impacted clients earlier this week specifies that the incident involved a third-party application serving the company's consumer support operations. ""We recently experienced a cyber incident involving a third-party application serving our U.S. consumer support operations,"" reads the data breach notice . ""The unauthorized access includes some limited personal information belonging to you."" The data exposed in this incident was ""limited"" according to the company, although what exactly it might entail hasn't been specified in the sample notification. Instead, the letter underlines that no credit reports or core credit information were exposed in this incident. TransUnion is now offering those impacted 24 months of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services. A wave of Salesforce data theft attacks has impacted numerous companies this year, including Google , Farmers Insurance , Allianz Life , Workday , Pandora , Cisco , Chanel , and Qantas . These attacks have been conducted by the Shiny Hunters extortion group , and more recently, by a cluster tracked as UNC6395 . After publishing this story, BleepingComputer confirmed with two sources, including ShinyHunters, that TransUnion's data breach is linked to these Salesforce attacks. The threat actor claims that the stolen data consists of over 13 million records, with 4.4 million records related to people in the US. A sample of the stolen data shared with BleepingComputer contains quite a lot of sensitive personal information, including names, billing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, and unredacted Social Security Numbers of TransUnion customers. The data also includes the reason for the customer transaction, such as a request for a free credit report. In addition to customer data, the threat actors also claim to have stolen customer support tickets and messages that were stored in Salesforce. BleepingComputer contacted TransUnion with further questions about this breach, and we will update this article if we receive a response. Two years ago, a threat actor claimed a data breach at TransUnion, which the company rejected , saying that the data had been stolen from a third party. In previous years, the company's South African and Canadian branches suffered cybersecurity breaches that exposed customer information.

Nelnet Servicing breach exposes data of 2.5M student loan accounts,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/nelnet-servicing-breach-exposes-data-of-25m-student-loan-accounts/,Bill Toulas,"August 29, 2022","Data for over 2.5 million individuals with student loans from Oklahoma Student Loan Authority (OSLA) and EdFinancial was exposed after hackers breached the systems of technology services provider Nelnet Servicing. Technology services from Nelnet Servicing, including a web portal, are used by OSLA and EdFinancial to give online access students taking out a loan access to their loan accounts. Sometime in June, unidentified intruders compromised Nelnet Servicing and stayed on its systems until July 22. The hackers compromised the company's network likely after exploiting a vulnerability. About 2,501,324 individuals have been impacted by the breach. A sample notification letter to impacted parties sent to the Office of the Maine Attorney General as part of the data breach disclosure process, Nelnet Servicing has informed OSLA and EdFinancial, who are notifying their customers. Although Nelnet states it blocked the cyberattack as soon as the breach was detected, a subsequent investigation that was completed on August 17, 2022, determined that certain student loan account registration information might have been accessed. The exposed information includes the following: The letters clarify that no financial account numbers or any form of payment information were exposed due to the security incident. EdFinancial also underlines that not all its clients are hosted by Nelnet Servicing, so not all students that took a loan through them are impacted by the data breach. Threat actors with access to the aforementioned information may engage in phishing attacks, social engineering, impersonation, and various scamming schemes. As the topic of loans is particularly sensitive, the risk of exposure is amplified. Due to the seriousness of this data breach incident, law firm ""Markovits, Stock & DeMarco"" yesterday launched an investigation on the potential of a class action lawsuit. Both EdFinancial and OSLA offer impacted individuals free access to a 24-month identity theft protection service through Experian, with instructions on how to enroll enclosed in the letters. “We encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud over the next 24 months, by reviewing your account statements and monitoring your free credit reports for suspicious activity and to detect errors,” reads to notice sent to affected borrowers. It is recommended that recipients of the notices take immediate action to protect themselves from fraud by enrolling in Experian’s IdentityWorks service and remaining vigilant against all incoming communication. Monitoring bank account statements and requesting a credit report is also advisable. Finally, placing a credit freeze should be considered for high-risk cases. Instructions on how to do that are included in the distributed notices. It's budget season!

Malware Infection at HR Company Triggers Flurry of Data Breach Notifications,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/malware-infection-at-hr-company-triggers-flurry-of-data-breach-notifications/#comment_form,Catalin Cimpanu,"June 6, 2018","A security breach at one of the world's largest human resources providers, Australian company PageUp, has resulted in tens of companies that were using their services notifying employees and applicants today that their personal data might have been stolen last month. In a statement about the incident published today, PageUp said the breach occurred due to a malware infection on one of its IT systems. The company discovered the malware on May 23 and launched a forensic investigation into the issue. ""On May 28, 2018, our investigations revealed that we have some indicators that client data may have been compromised,"" PageUp said today. PageUp is an Australian company that provides HR, careers, and recruitment services across the world. Customers who sign up with PageUp can embed a custom IT solution on their public ""career sites"" and intranets that helps them publish job openings, receive applicant CVs, and select the appropriate candidates. Data submitted by job applicants is stored on PageUp's cloud infrastructure, and HR staffers at each company can access it via customized dashboards. All in all, PageUp's solution is quite popular with HR departments across the world. The company touts hundreds of customers, ranging from US universities to government departments, and from supermarket chains to the world's largest banks. All of these customers have now been notified of the PageUp breach, and each of them is now notifying their own employees and job applicants of the security incident. It's because of the PageUp breach that the internet is abuzz today with a flurry of breach notifications that have been sent out by PageUp's clients. Internet service provider Telstra ; the Tasmanian Government , supermarket chains Kmart , Target , and Coles ; the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) TV station; the Australia Post newspaper; healthcare provider Medibank ; the Reserve Bank of Australia ; and many other more, have published breach notifications, shut down career portals, or removed PageUp integrations from their job listing pages. PageUp was unable to say what data the malware was able to steal from is systems and from which of its customers. The HR company said each customer stored different data, but that its investigation is still in its early stages to know what exactly had been compromised from each client's database. Even if it has limited details about the incident and the stolen data, PageUp went public today with its breach notification because of new privacy laws such as the EU's GDPR and Australia's Privacy Act Notifiable Data Breaches (NDB) scheme (which came into effect on February 22, 2018). These laws force companies to alert customers of breaches as soon as they learn of them so that users can take protective measures. While the breach notifications appear mainly on the websites of Australian companies and Australian branches of foreign companies, the breach might also impact users located in other countries that have applied for jobs through a PageUp-powered careers portal. PageUp promised to publish more updates about what the attackers manage to steal via the malware on an official incident FAQ page . ""The malware has been eradicated from our systems and we have confirmed that our anti-malware signatures can now detect the malware,"" PageUp said today. The HR company also said that it is currently working with law enforcement and a third-party security firm to dig through the forensic data and the determine the breach's scope. ""All client user and candidate passwords in our database are hashed using bcrypt and salted, however, out of an abundance of caution, we suggest users change their password,"" PageUp recommended.

"Texas sues PowerSchool over breach exposing 62M students, 880k Texans",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/texas-sues-powerschool-after-massive-data-breach-hit-62-million-students/,Sergiu Gatlan,"September 4, 2025","Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has filed a lawsuit against education software company PowerSchool, which suffered a massive data breach in December that exposed the personal information of 62 million students, including over 880,000 Texans. PowerSchool is a cloud-based software solutions provider for K-12 schools and districts, with more than 18,000 customers and supporting over 60 million students worldwide. In January, the education software giant disclosed that its PowerSource customer support portal was breached on December 19, 2024, using a subcontractor's stolen credentials. The attacker demanded a $2.85 million ransom in Bitcoin on December 28, 2024, after stealing the full names, physical addresses, phone numbers, passwords, parent information, contact details, Social Security numbers, and medical data of impacted students and faculty. As BleepingComputer first reported, the threat actor behind the December 2024 PowerSchool breach claimed to have stolen the personal data of 62.4 million students and 9.5 million teachers from 6,505 school districts across the U.S., Canada, and other countries. ""PowerSchool's failures violate both the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act and the Identity Theft Enforcement and Protection Act by misleading customers about its security practices and failing to take reasonable measures to protect sensitive information entrusted by Texas families and school districts,"" the Office of the Attorney General of Texas said . ""If Big Tech thinks they can profit off managing children's data while cutting corners on security, they are dead wrong. Parents should never have to worry that the information they provide to enroll their children in school could be stolen and misused. My office will do everything we can to hold PowerSchool accountable for putting Texas students, teachers, and families at risk,"" Attorney General Paxton added on Wednesday. In a private FAQ shared with customers and reviewed by BleepingComputer at the time, PowerSchool acknowledged that it had made a ransom payment to stop the data from being disclosed and received a video from the attacker claiming that the stolen data had been erased. However, someone claiming to be ShinyHunters began individually extorting school districts in early May, threatening to release the previously stolen student and teacher data if a ransom was not paid. The leader of ShinyHunters claimed to BleepingComputer that this person was an affiliate falsely impersonating the hacking group, who attempted to re-extort PowerSchool with data stolen in an earlier September 2024 breach seen by CrowdStrike . Later that month, 19-year-old college student Matthew D. Lane from Worcester, Massachusetts, pleaded guilty to orchestrating the massive cyberattack on PowerSchool with the help of several other conspirators and attempting to extort millions of dollars in exchange for not leaking the stolen data of millions. According to school notices and a DataBreaches.net report, the ransom demands sent to school districts claimed to be from ShinyHunters , a high-profile group of threat actors linked to a wide range of breaches that had impacted hundreds of millions of people . In March, PowerSchool also published a CrowdStrike investigation into the incident, which revealed that threat actors had also breached PowerSource in August and September 2024 , using the same compromised credentials. However, the cybersecurity company was unable to find evidence that the same attacker was responsible for all three breaches. Update 9/4/25: Added information about ShinyHunters affiliate.

"Twilio discloses another hack from June, blames voice phishing",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/twilio-discloses-another-hack-from-june-blames-voice-phishing/,Sergiu Gatlan,"October 27, 2022","Cloud communications company Twilio disclosed a new data breach stemming from a June 2022 security incident where the same attackers behind the August hack accessed some customers' information. Twilio says this was a ""brief security incident"" on June 29. The attacker used social engineering to trick an employee into handing over their credentials in a voice phishing attack. The stolen credentials were then used ""to access customer contact information for a limited number of customers."" ""The threat actor's access was identified and eradicated within 12 hours. Customers whose information was impacted by the June Incident were notified on July 2, 2022,"" the company revealed on Thursday. Twilio also shared that hackers behind the August breach had accessed the data of 209 customers and 93 Authy end users after breaching some internal non-production systems using employee credentials stolen in an SMS phishing attack. ""209 customers – out of a total customer base of over 270,000 – and 93 Authy end users – out of approximately 75 million total users – had accounts that were impacted by the incident,"" Twilio said . After concluding the incident investigation, Twilio also found no evidence that any of its customers' console account credentials, API keys, or authentication tokens were also accessed. While the company disclosed the incident on August 7, it now revealed the attackers maintained access to this environment for two more days. ""The last observed unauthorized activity in our environment was on August 9, 2022,"" the company added. As Twilio said after the August incident, the attackers gained access to its network using employee credentials stolen in an SMS phishing attack. Once inside Twilio's systems, the hackers accessed customer data using administrative portals , accessed Authy 2FA accounts and codes , and registered their own devices to obtain temporary tokens. The Twilio data breach is part of a more extensive campaign from a threat actor tracked as Scatter Swine or 0ktapus that targeted at least 130 organizations, including MailChimp , Klaviyo , and Cloudflare . Cloudflare, which also disclosed that its employees had their credentials stolen in a similar SMS phishing attack, said the attackers failed to breach its systems after having their login attempts blocked by company-issued FIDO2-compliant hardware security keys. As a result of the June and August breaches, Twilio says it reset the credentials of the compromised employee user accounts and is distributing FIDO2 tokens to all employees.

With the huge amount of people affected, almost half of all Americans, and the massive media exposure, hopefully most victims have been proactive in monitoring their credit to make sure no funny business is going on. This new report , though, is really eye opening as it shows exactly what information was exposed and for how many people. We are talking about addresses, dates of birth, social security numbers, genders, phone numbers, drivers license numbers, credit card numbers, tax ID, and the state of your drivers license. Payment Card Number and Expiration Date The fact that any company stores such a huge amount of information about an individual, when that individual never worked directly with them, is down right scary to me. For anyone who was affected and did not do anything, you should really add a credit freeze to prevent new credit from being taken out using your information. If you take out new lines of credit often, then at a bare minimum you should add a fraud alert so that the creditors call you first before opening new accounts.

The Indian national carrier first informed passengers that SITA was the victim of a cyberattack on March 19. ""This is to inform that SITA PSS our data processor of the passenger service system (which is responsible for storing and processing of personal information of the passengers) had recently been subjected to a cybersecurity attack leading to personal data leak of certain passengers,"" Air India said in a breach notification sent over the weekend. ""This incident affected around 4,500,000 data subjects in the world."" The airline added that the breach impacted the data of passengers registered between August 2011 and February 2021. Nevertheless, after investigating the security incident, it was found that no credit card information or password data was accessed during the breach. However, Air India urges its passengers to change their credentials to block potential breach attempts and ensure their data security. ""The breach involved personal data registered between 26th August 2011 and 3rd February 2021, with details that included name, date of birth, contact information, passport information, ticket information, Star Alliance, and Air India frequent flyer data (but no passwords data were affected) as well as credit cards data,"" Air India added [PDF].

Slim CD is a provider of payment processing solutions that enables businesses to access electronic and card payments via web-based terminals, mobile, or desktop apps. The firm first detected suspicious activity on its systems this year on June 15. During the investigation, the company discovered that hackers had gained access to its network since August 17, 2023. “The investigation identified unauthorized system access between August 17, 2023, and June 15, 2024,” reads the notification to impacted individuals. However, Slim CD says that the threat actor viewed or obtained access to credit card information this year for two days, between June 14th and 15th ""That access may have enabled an unauthorized actor to view or obtain certain credit card information between June 14, 2024, and June 15, 2024,” Slim CD says in the data breach notification. The types of data that may have been accessed by the unauthorized part include: Though the exposed information is not enough to allow cybercriminals to perform fraudulent transactions, since the card verification number (CVV) is missing, a risk of credit card fraud still exists. Slim CD says it has taken measures to strengthen its security to prevent similar incidents in the future. At the same time, it advises the notice recipients to remain vigilant for signs of fraud and identity fraud attempts and report suspicious activity to the card issuer as soon as possible.

In a new data breach notification issued yesterday, iOttie says they discovered on June 13th that its online store was compromised between April 12th, 2023, and June 2nd with malicious scripts. ""We believe criminal e-skimming occurred from April 12, 2023, through June 2, 2023. However, on June 2, 2023, during a WordPress/plugin update, the malicious code was removed,"" warns the iOttie data breach notification . ""Nevertheless, they could have obtained your credit card information to purchase our client's product online at www. iOttie.com."" iOttie has not shared how many customers were impacted but said that names, personal information, and payment information could have been stolen, including financial account numbers, credit and debit card numbers, security codes, access codes, passwords, and PINs. This type of attack is known as MageCart, which is when threat actors hack online stores to inject malicious JavaScript into checkout pages. When a shopper submits their credit card information, the script steals the inputted data and sends it to the threat actors. This data is then used to conduct financial fraud, identity theft, or sold to other threat actors on dark web marketplaces. Due to the detailed information potentially exposed in this attack, all iOttie customers who purchased a product between April 12th and June 2nd should monitor their credit card statements and bank accounts for fraudulent activity. While iOttie has not shared how they were breached, their online store is a WordPress site with the WooCommerce merchant plugin. WordPress is one of the most commonly targeted website platforms by threat actors, with vulnerabilities often found in plugins that allow complete takeovers of sites or malicious code injection into WordPress templates. As iOttie disclosed that the malicious code was removed with a plugin update, the hackers likely breached the site using a vulnerability in one of its WordPress plugins.

""Pizza Hut identified the security intrusion quickly and took immediate action to halt it,"" the company added. ""The security intrusion at issue impacted a small percentage of our customers and we estimate that less than one percent of the visits to our website over the course of the relevant week were affected."" Despite coming clean about the security incident, Pizza Hut may have been too late. On Twitter, at least five users reported fraudulent transactions they suspect took place because of the Pizza Hut breach. Users said fraudulent charges on their cards took place one week before Pizza Hut informed customers, and they're now holding the pizza maker responsible. Hey @pizzahut , thanks for telling me you got hacked 2 weeks after you lost my cc number. And a week after someone started using it. #timely if you had sent that sooner, i could've been more proactive about the fact that you allowed my card and billing info to be stolen. @pizzahut great security there & thanks for the delay in notifying us after thieves already charged our accts.

"Database from StockX Hack Sold Online, Check If You're Included",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/database-from-stockx-hack-sold-online-check-if-youre-included/#comment_form,Lawrence Abrams,"August 11, 2019","A database reportedly containing 6,840,339 unique user accounts from the recent StockX data breach is being sold and distributed online. Bad actors have stated that they have already begun to decrypt the passwords and it is expected for this information to be used in future attacks. Last week it came to light that StockX was hacked and an attacker stole user account information. This information included user names, email addresses, addresses, shoe size, purchase history, and encrypted passwords. Over the weekend, data breach site Have I been Pwned added the StockX database to their site so that users can check if their emails are part of the breach. This database was shared by password crashing site Dehashed.com and consists of 6,840,339 accounts containing ""unique email addresses, names, physical addresses, purchases and passwords stored as salted MD5 hashes"". To check if your information has been exposed as part of this breach, you can enter your email address into https://haveibeenpwned.com/ and it will report if your information has been found in any breaches, including the StockX one. Security researcher Jim Scott, who has assisted HIBP in finding data dumps in the past, has told BleepingComputer that the StockX database was originally being sold on the Apollon marketplace for $300. Since then, the username and password combinations have been found being distributed on underground hacker forums for as little as $2.15. As these prices make the database essentially free, it will now be in the hands of numerous attackers who will try to crack the passwords. For those who do not want to deal with the decrypting of the passwords, one person has allegedly decrypted 367,000 accounts from the database and is selling them for $400. Now that the database dump is easily available for relatively nothing, the account credentials will be used in credential stuffing attacks. A credential stuffing attack is when attackers compile usernames and passwords that were leaked from different company's data breaches and use those credentials to try and gain access to accounts at other sites. This type of attack works particularly well against users who use the same password at every site. If your StockX password is also used at other sites, you should immediately change your passwords at all sites that it is used. By not doing so, you stand the risk of having those accounts compromised as well.

Domino's India discloses data breach after hackers sell data online,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dominos-india-discloses-data-breach-after-hackers-sell-data-online/#comment_form,Lawrence Abrams,"May 25, 2021","Domino's India has disclosed a data breach after a threat actor hacked their systems and sold their stolen data on a hacking forum. In April 2021, a threat actor created a new topic on a hacking forum where they claimed to be selling 13 TB of stolen data, including details for 18 crores (180 million) orders and 1 million credit cards, from Domino's India. The threat actor was selling the data for approximately 10 BTC, or $380,000 at today's rates, and shared samples of the database structure for the allegedly stolen data. This month, the same threat actors launched a Tor dark web search engine that allows people to enter their phone numbers or email addresses to see if their information is exposed in the database. Before using this search engine, it is vital to remember that the threat actor run this service. Therefore, any submitted data could be used for further malicious activity, such as phishing and smishing attacks. Domino's India users have told BleepingComputer that they tested the search engine, and it did contain their orders and other personal information from their account. Today, Security researcher Rajshekhar Rajaharia , who has been following this breach, tweeted that Domino's India has finally begun disclosing the data breach - over a month after it was first reported. In a short email to customers, Jubilant Networks, the master franchise owner for Domino's Pizza in India, disclosed that they were hacked on March 24th, 2021. However, they state that the threat actor's claims to have stolen 1 million credit cards are false as they do not store any financial details of users on their site. From the database tables and information shared with BleepingComputer by users who utilized the search engine, the data does include customers' mobile numbers, names, email addresses, and GPS coordinates. When combined, hackers can use this information to perform further attacks, such as phishing scams and SMS messaging scams, to steal further sensitive data from those exposed in this breach. All Domino's India customers should be on the lookout for emails and texts pretending to be from Domino's and not provide any information, such as credit cards and passwords unless you are specifically accessing the https://www.dominos.co.in/ website.

The company is one of the largest telecommunication service providers in France, offering mobile, internet, and IPTV services. Bouygues Telecom has 14.5 million mobile subscribers, 9,000 employees, and an annual revenue of €56.8 billion ($66B). Bouygues Telecom confirmed in a FAQ and a press statement that the attack occurred last Sunday, August 4, 2025. Although Bouygues Telecom says that there has been no impact observed on customer services or networks, the personal data of 6.4 million customers was compromised. ""Bouygues Telecom was the victim of a cyberattack that allowed unauthorized access to certain personal data from 6.4 million customer account,"" reads the translated press statement . ""The situation was resolved as quickly as possible by Bouygues Telecom's technical teams, and all necessary additional measures have been implemented."" A previous statement says that internal investigations confirmed that the attack was orchestrated by a 'known cybercriminal group' that targeted 'specific internal resources.' The firm informed the French National Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI) and the CNIL (French data protection authority) accordingly, noting that the perpetrator could face up to 5 years of imprisonment and a €150,000 fine for this attack. According to the FAQ, the following customer information was stolen: Importantly, the company said that no credit card numbers or Bouygues Telecom account passwords were compromised. The company has now blocked the attacker's access to its network, increased monitoring, and implemented additional security measures. Customers are being informed of the breach directly via SMS and email, but the situation has exposed them to fraud and phishing risks. Bouygues Telecom urges its customers not to give away sensitive information like their login credentials to people calling them and mentioning their name and account number to gain their trust. Although the leaked IBANs are not enough for initial transfers, impacted individuals are still advised to regularly check their debits and contact their bank immediately if they notice suspicious activity. Just last week, another French telecommunications giant, Orange, disclosed a similar network breach that occurred on July 25, 2025. Investigations to determine whether customer data was stolen are still ongoing, and the company has not published an update on this. These incidents targeting European telecom providers echo similar attacks against U.S.-based telcos, attributed to Chinese cyber-espionage agents of the Salt Typhoon hacking group. BleepingComputer contacted Bouygues Teleco with questions about the attack and will update the story if we receive a response. It's budget season!

""Following further investigation, we discovered that the unauthorized third party accessed and copied some of the personal data we record about you when you contact us for support: the name given when contacting us, email address, helpdesk identification number, gamertag and console details,"" 2K said. ""There is no indication that any of your financial information or password(s) held on our systems were compromised."" 2K also told users that it found no evidence the attackers were able to steal account credentials and advised them to reset their passwords to ensure their accounts were safe. ""At this time, we have no evidence any 2K account passwords were compromised or included in this unauthorized posting, nor has the unauthorized third party claimed to have obtained any passwords,"" the company added in a support document . ""However, out of an abundance of caution, we encourage all of our players to secure their accounts by resetting passwords and enabling multi-factor authentication if they have not already done so."" This was also confirmed by the threat actor who is now selling the data on a hacker forum as a 2K support database bundle containing more than 4 million records. ""This is a database of the 2K Games Support it includes id, username, email, zendesk_email, real_name, platform. It includes 4 Million+ lines of everyone who has sent a support email to 2k,"" the threat actor says. While 2K told users its help portal is now back online, it also warned them to remain vigilant and keep an eye out for any suspicious activity across their accounts. Customers were told never to click suspicious links they receive in messages they didn't expect to receive and to enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) whenever available (e.g., personal email, banking, and phone or Internet provider accounts). Those who have clicked the malicious links sent via 2K's helpdesk system were warned that the malware might've stolen their credentials and are recommended to reset all their passwords and install anti-malware software. This aligns with Redline Stealer's known capabilities seeing that the info-stealer can harvest a wide range of data after infecting victims' systems, including saved browser passwords, credit cards, VPN credentials, cookies, instant messages, cryptocurrency wallets, and more. Users who have received one of the malicious emails and haven't clicked any of the embedded links are not at risk and should delete the emails from their inboxes.

Havenly discloses data breach after 1.3M accounts leaked online,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/havenly-discloses-data-breach-after-13m-accounts-leaked-online/,Lawrence Abrams,"August 2, 2020","Havenly, a US-based interior design web site, has disclosed a data breach after a hacker posted a database containing 1.3 million user records for free on a hacker forum. Havenly is an online interior design and home decoration site where users can get help designing a room in their house from certified designers. Last week, BleepingComputer reported that the ShinyHunters hacking group had leaked the databases for 18 companies on a hacker forum for free. These databases contained a combined total of 386 million user records. One of the leaked databases contained 1.3 million user records for Havenly.com. From the samples of this database seen by BleepingComputer, the leaked data included a user's login name, full name, MD5 hashed password, email address, phone number, zip, and various other data related to the usage of the site. On July 27th, BleepingComputer contacted Havenly to report the data breach but had not received a reply to our inquiry. Yesterday, five days after we sent our email, Havenly officially disclosed the data breach and are emailing notifications to users. Havenly is sending out data breach notifications stating that they ""recently became aware of a potential incident"" and performed a mandatory reset of all passwords. ""We take the security of our community very seriously. As a precaution, we wanted to let you know that we recently became aware of a potential incident that may have affected the security of certain customer accounts. We are working with external security experts to investigate this matter."" ""However, in the meantime, out of an abundance of caution, we are logging all existing customers out of their Havenly accounts and asking our customers to reset their password when they next log in to the Havenly website. As a best practice, we also encourage all of our customers to use different passwords across all online services and applications, and to update those passwords now and on a regular basis,"" Havenly's data breach notification stated. Havenly stated that they do not store complete credit card information, and only the last four digits may have been exposed. ""We suspect that many of you will be concerned about the credit card numbers that you've used with Havenly in the past. Please note: we do NOT store credit card information, apart from the last 4 digits of the card in some cases, which is not enough to engage in credit card fraud,"" Havenly disclosed. In the limited sample seen by BleepingComputer, we did not see any credit card information, including the last four digits. If you are concerned that your account was part of this data breach, Have I Been Pwned has added Havenly to their data breach lookup service, and you can use it to check if your email address was involved. While the passwords leaked in this data breach were hashed, it is still possible for threat actors to decrypt the password. After a user's password is cracked, threat actors would be able to use them to try and login at other sites you may have an account. Therefore, if you are a Havenly customer, you should immediately change your password to a strong and unique one. If that same password was used at another site, you should change it at any other site that also uses it. When changing your passwords, be sure to use a unique and strong password at every site so that a data breach does not affect your account at other companies. A password manager can make it much easier to use unique passwords at every site and is highly recommended. It's budget season!

Hacker Wants $50K From Hacker Forum or He'll Share Stolen Database With the Feds,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacker-wants-50k-from-hacker-forum-or-hell-share-stolen-database-with-the-feds/,Catalin Cimpanu,"October 26, 2017","Extortion can also be funny when it happens to the bad guys, and there's one extortion attempt going on right now that will put a big smile on your face. The victim is Basetools.ws, an underground hacking forum that allows users to trade stolen credit card information, profile data, and spamming tools. The site boasts to have over 150,000 users and over 20,000 tools listed in its forums. Earlier this week, on Tuesday, an anonymous user appears to have breached the site, and uploaded samples of its database online, along with a ransom demand. The attacker is asking for $50,000 or he'll share data on the site's administrator with US authorities, such as the FBI, DHS, DOJ, and the DOT (Department of Treasury). To prove the validity of his claims, the hacker shared an image of the Basetools admin panel and an image containing the site admin's login details and IP address. In addition, the hacker also dumped tools that Basetools users were selling on the site, such as login credentials for C-Panel accounts; login credentials for shells, backdoors, and spambots hosted on hacked sites; credentials for RDP servers; server SSH credentials, user data leaked from various breaches at legitimate sites, and many other more. As soon as the ransom demand and accompanying data was published online, the Basetools portal went offline and entered maintenance mode. ""Yeah, the fact that site is down right now certainly doesn't look good for them,"" security researcher Dylan Katz told Bleeping Computer today regarding the possibility of the ransom demand being a fake breach. Nonetheless, ""50k is a pretty steep ransom, seeing as the damange has already been done,"" Katz added. But financial gain is not the only motivation behind this hack. According to other text included in the ransom demand, the hacker also appears to have carried out the hack out of revenge, claiming the site's operator has been manipulating stats. ""Basetools.pw is manipulating EARNING STATS & RESELLER STATS, Owner of this market has opened a reseller with name RedHat which always stays in First Place,"" the text reads. Despite the ""small potatoes"" feel that you get when reading about a breach at a hackers' forum, this security incident is quite of note. All the Basetools seller data that was supposedly being sold on the forums before the hack is now online and easily accessible to anyone. This means that credentials for thousands of servers are now in easy reach to anyone who knows where to look for it. Other hackers could take over these servers and deploy them in spam, malware hosting, or other malicious campaigns. The owners of these services will need to be notified so they can change credentials and clean up affected systems. Furthermore, Katz has also identified user data that appears to come from services that have not previously announced they suffered a data breach. These services will also need to be notified so they can investigate any potential breaches, and reset passwords for affected accounts. Katz is currently processing the leaked data and intends to reach out to some of the affected parties. As MCP (Model Context Protocol) becomes the standard for connecting LLMs to tools and data, security teams are moving fast to keep these new services safe.

Colorado State University is a public research university with nearly 28,000 students and 6,000 academic and administrative staff members, operating on an endowment of $558,000,000. The University informed its students and staff on July 12th, 2023, that the threat actors have gained access to the personal data of staff and students through these attacks. Although the actual extent and impact of the data breach are still being evaluated, CSU has provided the following statement on a webpage dedicated to the cyber incident. ""Some data about prospective, current, and former CSU students and current and former employees maintained by the affected vendors contains personally identifiable information, which may include first name, middle initial, last name, date of birth, student or employee identification numbers, social security number, and demographic information such as gender, ethnicity, and level and area of education."" warned CSU . The University says that the stolen data is from as far back as 2021, possibly earlier, meaning that graduates may have been impacted. The leak of this data is not the result of a direct breach of any systems operated or maintained by CSU but rather a compromise of the University's service vendors, TIAA, National Student Clearinghouse, Corebridge Financial, Genworth Financial, Sunlife, and The Hartford. All of these providers utilized the MOVEit Transfer security file transfer platform, which was breached in a wave of data-theft attacks in May 2023. CSU says the above entities offer services to many universities across the United States, so other educational institutes may soon publish similar disclosures. Since then, Stony Brook University , the University of Delaware , and the Western University of Health Sciences have posted data breach notices relating to the compromise of TIAA, NSC, and Corebridge Financial. Right now, CSU is carrying out an internal investigation with the help of forensic experts to determine which records and individuals have been impacted by the incident and will send out individual notification letters to those people containing additional resources and protection guidance. Meanwhile, all CSU community members are advised to remain vigilant and report suspected identity theft incidents to the university and law enforcement authorities. Currently, no identity theft protection service coverage is offered to CSU members, who are recommended to follow the advice FTC published here.

The attackers were able to inject malicious scripts designed to harvest and exfiltrate customers' payment cards after exploiting a now-addressed website vulnerability. Such attacks are known as web skimming attacks (also known as Magecart or e-skimming) and are usually the result of attackers being able to deploy card skimmer scripts on e-commerce sites via compromised admin accounts. ""An unauthorized party gained access to Michigan State University’s online store, shop.msu.edu, and placed malicious code to expose shoppers’ credit card numbers between Oct. 19, 2019 and June 26, 2020,"" MSU said today in a statement . ""Once the university was notified, an initial investigation determined the exposed information included names, addresses and credit card numbers of about 2,600 customers."" The university says that no Social Security numbers were stolen during the nine months the attackers had access to the shop.msu.edu online store. MSU also says that the university's security team addressed the site vulnerability used to gain access to the compromised online shop and that it is currently working with law enforcement as part of an ongoing investigation. ""Our top priority is preventing any further exposure of consumers’ information by sharing resources and tools to help protect them from these cyber criminals,"" MSU Interim Chief Information Security Officer Daniel Ayala said. ""The security of our IT systems and those who use them are of paramount importance to MSU. We are deeply sorry and understand the concern of those affected. We are working around the clock to make it right."" If consumers believe they may have been impacted by this incident and have not received an official notice from the university by Aug. 30, they are encouraged to call the university at 517-355-1855. MSU is notifying all potentially affected customers of the data breach and is offering all of them free identity protection and credit monitoring. Administrators of the shop.msu.edu site are required to go through mandatory training to make sure that they will follow all appropriate security measures to prevent similar attacks in the future.

Coffee Meets Bagel Dating App Discloses Data Breach on Valentine's Day,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/coffee-meets-bagel-dating-app-discloses-data-breach-on-valentines-day/#comment_form,Lawrence Abrams,"February 14, 2019","As a Valentine's Day gift to all its users, online dating app Coffee Meets Bagel disclosed a data breach that contained user's email addresses and names. This data breach was discovered as part of a compilation of leaked credentials that was being sold on criminal marketplaces. According to the data breach notification, Coffee Meets Bagel became aware of the breach on February 11th 2019 after a report from TheRegister stated it was being sold as part of a larger compilation of leaked credentials. In a data breach notification email sent today, which is provided in its entirety below, the data consisted of 6 million Coffee Meets Bagel user names and email addresses. The dating company states that the breach did not disclose any user passwords or financial information, as that information is never stored by the app. In a statement to BleepingComputer, Coffee Meets Bagel stated: ""With online dating, people need to feel safe. If they don't feel safe, they won't share themselves authentically or make meaningful connections. We take that responsibility seriously, so we informed our community as soon as possible—regardless of what calendar date it fell on—about what happened and what we are doing about it. We can confirm that approximately six million users were impacted. Beyond emails and names, no other CMB user information was compromised. This was part of a larger breach affecting 620 million accounts that got leaked across sixteen companies."" While the data being sold only contained email addresses and names, it could still be used in attacks. Andy Norton, the Director of Threat Intelligence for security firm LastLine, told BleepingComputer via email that data like this is typically used for phishing campaigns and credential stuffing attacks. “The Coffee Meets Bagel data is reportedly being sold on Dream Market, although it’s currently offline so we’ve been unable to confirm. Dream Market is a dark market that sells many illegal things, including drugs, guns and stolen digital items. Essentially, these cybercriminals are trying to sell a list. Lists of personal information are one end of a malicious funnel, and the data is often bought by spammers and operators of credential stuffing tools.” Due to this, if you use the same password at every site, you should change those passwords to a strong and unique one immediately. To aid in creating and remembering unique passwords for every site you visit, it is suggested that you use a password management program. It's budget season!

Anonymous Sudan is known for debilitating distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against Western entities in recent months. The group has confirmed their affiliation with pro-Russian hacktivists like Killnet. Last month, Microsoft admitted that Anonymous Sudan was responsible for service disruptions and outages at the beginning of June that impacting several of its services, including Azure, Outlook, and OneDrive. Yesterday, the hacktivists alleged that they had “successfully hacked Microsoft” and “accessed a large database containing more than 30 million Microsoft accounts, emails, and passwords.” Anonymous Sudan offered to sell this database to interested parties for $50,000 and urged interested buyers to engage in contact with their Telegram bot to arrange the purchase of the data. The post even includes a sample of the data they offered (allegedly stolen from Microsoft) as proof of the breach and warned that Microsoft would deny those claims. The group provided 100 credential pairs but their origin could not be verified (old data, the result of a breach at third-party service provider, stolen from Microsoft’s systems). BleepingComputer has contacted Microsoft to request a comment on the validity of Anonymous Sudan's saying and a company spokesperson flatly denied any data breach claims. “At this time, our analysis of the data shows that this is not a legitimate claim and an aggregation of data,” a company representative told BleepingComputer. “We have seen no evidence that our customer data has been accessed or compromised” - Microsoft spokesperson It is unclear at the moment if Microsoft's investigation is complete or it's ongoing.

The North Face warns customers of April credential stuffing attack,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-north-face-warns-customers-of-april-credential-stuffing-attack/,Bill Toulas,"June 2, 2025","Outdoor apparel retailer The North Face is warning customers that their personal information was stolen in credential stuffing attacks targeting the company's website in April. The North Face is a major American outdoor apparel and equipment brand owned by VF Corporation that also controls Vans, Timberland, and Dickies. The North Face generates over $3 billion in annual revenue, making it one of the largest outdoor brands in the world, with its e-commerce accounting for approximately 42% of its total sales volumes. Credential stuffing attacks are a type of cyberattack where threat actors attempt to gain unauthorized access to user accounts by automating login attempts using username-password pairs previously exposed in data breaches. The technique is possible thanks to ""credentials recycling,"" which is when people use the same username and password across multiple online services. However, if the accounts are protected by multi-factor authentication (MFA), these attacks fail even if the passwords are compromised. The North Face has now begun to send data breach notifications to impacted customers, with a sample notice shared with the Vermont Attorney General that informs customers that it recently suffered a credential stuffing attack. ""On April 23, 2025, we discovered unusual activity involving our website, thenorthface.com, which we investigated immediately,"" reads the notice . ""Following a careful and prompt investigation, we concluded that an attacker had launched a small scale credential stuffing attack against our website on April 23, 2025."" The data that has been exposed includes the following: It is noted that payment information was not exposed, as an external provider handles payments on the site, and The North Face doesn't retain anything but a token required for the process to go through. In the case of The North Face, the decision not to enforce MFA on all accounts has come at a significant cost to its customer base, as this is the fourth credential stuffing incident the brand's site has suffered since 2020. Earlier this year, its parent company, VF Outdoor, informed of a credential stuffing attack impacting 'thenorthface.com' and 'timberland.com,' discovered on March 13, 2025 . That incident exposed 15,700 accounts. Two similar incidents were disclosed in November 2020 and September 2022 , impacting over 200,000 customers. The most severe cybersecurity incident hitting The North Face was a December 2023 ransomware attack that was later confirmed to have impacted 35,000,000 customers .

UPS discloses data breach after exposed customer info used in SMS phishing,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ups-discloses-data-breach-after-exposed-customer-info-used-in-sms-phishing/,Sergiu Gatlan,"June 21, 2023","Multinational shipping company UPS is alerting Canadian customers that some of their personal information might have been exposed via its online package look-up tools and abused in phishing attacks. At first glance, the letters sent by UPS Canada, titled ""Fighting phishing and smishing - an update from UPS,"" seem to be a warning to customers about the dangers of phishing. However, it turns out that this is actually a data breach notification, with the company sneaking in a disclosure stating that it has been receiving reports of SMS phishing messages containing the recipients' names and address info. ""UPS is aware that some package recipients have received fraudulent text messages demanding payment before a package can be delivered,"" UPS said in a letter shared by Emsisoft threat analyst Brett Callow. ""Breach notifications need to be absolutely clear about what they are from the get-go. Fluffing them out helps nobody and simply increases the chances that they'll be put in the garbage unread,"" Callow told BleepingComputer. After receiving the phishing reports, UPS worked with partners within the delivery chain to understand the method used by the threat actors to harvest their targets' shipping information. Following an internal review, UPS found that the attackers behind this ongoing SMS phishing campaign were using its package look-up tools to access delivery details, including the recipients' personal contact information, between February 2022 and April 2023. The company has now implemented measures designed to restrict access to this sensitive data to thwart these convincing phishing attempts. UPS says it's notifying individuals whose information may have been affected to ensure transparency and awareness of the situation. ""The information available through the package look-up tools included the recipient's name, shipment address, and potentially phone number and order number,"" UPS said. ""We cannot provide you with the exact time frame that the misuse of our package look-up tools occurred. It may have affected packages for a small group of shippers and some of their customers from February 1, 2022 to April 24, 2023."" UPS customers worldwide have been affected by these phishing attacks, as shown by online reports showing the threat actors using their names, phone numbers, and postal codes , as well as info on recent orders. According to numerous malicious text messages seen by BleepingComputer and believed to be sent during this campaign, the threat actors are impersonating LEGO and Apple shipments, with other companies likely also impacted. A UPS spokesperson was not immediately for comment when contacted by BleepingComputer earlier today regarding the number of affected customers and what other shippers were impersonated in the attacks. In September and July , the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) warned Americans of a massive rise in SMS phishing attacks. The two federal agencies asked them to be wary of text messages coming from unknown numbers with suspicious links and often containing misleading and incomplete information. To defend against such attacks, you should never click links embedded in suspicious messages or reply with sensitive information. Update: An UPS spokesperson shared the following statement after the article was published: We are constantly vigilant when it comes to phishing and other attempts from bad actors. UPS is aware of reports relating to an SMS phishing (“Smishing”) scheme focused on certain shippers and some of their customers in Canada. UPS has been working with partners in the delivery chain to understand how that fraud was being perpetrated, as well as with law enforcement and third-party experts to identify the cause of this scheme and to put a stop to it. Law enforcement has indicated that there has been an increase in smishing impacting a number of shippers and many different industries. Out of an abundance of caution, UPS is sending privacy incident notification letters to individuals in Canada whose information may have been impacted.

DNS is Russia's second-largest computer and home appliance store chain, with 2,000 branches and 35,000 employees. According to the scant details provided in the announcement, a group of hackers residing outside the Russian Federation exploited a security gap in the company's IT systems and accessed customer and employee details. ""We have already found gaps in the protection of our information infrastructure and are working to strengthen information security in the company,"" says the DNS announcement . While the firm has not provided details on what information was compromised, it clarified that the hackers didn't steal user passwords and payment card data, as that data isn't stored on their systems. DNS' disclosure of a security breach comes hours after a threat actor began leaking the company's data on a hacking forum, allegedly stolen by a hacking group known as 'NLB Team.' The data was allegedly stolen on September 19 and contains full names, usernames, email addresses, and phone numbers of DNS customers and employees for 16 million people. According to SimilarWeb data, DNS-shop.ru receives approximately 81.3 million visits per month, being in the top 30 most visited sites in the country, so the alleged number of impacted individuals seems plausible. Neither the volume of the stolen data nor the type of the information has been officially confirmed. It is worth noting that the same person leaking DNS' data had previously offered databases belonging to other Russian organizations, ""Cherlock.ru,"" a legal information portal, and ""CDEK.market,"" a consumer goods e-commerce platform. The attack against DNS is allegedly the work of pro-Ukrainian hackers, but new reports have surfaced over the weekend that put a new threat in the frame for Russian sites. Kyiv Post reports that hackers affiliated with the so-called ""National Republican Army"" (NRA), an organization uniting dissidents seeking to overthrow Putin, are launching attacks against key Russian firms. Their first high-profile victim is allegedly ""Unisoftware,"" a software development firm that works closely with the Russian government, the Central Bank, and the federal tax service. Reportedly, the attack involved the deployment of a ransomware strain to cause damage, while the group also shared some screenshots with the publication as evidence of their access.

The number of records accessed by hackers corresponds to at least 38,000 SA government employees, but it could be as high as 80,000 according to South Australia's Treasurer Rob Lucas. The breached company behind this data breach is Frontier Software, which suffered from a ransomware attack on November 13, 2021 . According to the company's statement on the incident, the threat didn't pivot to client systems through their products and the data exfiltration only affected a specific segmented environment. ""The ongoing forensic investigation and other response activities conducted by Frontier Software and CyberCX has now confirmed evidence of some data exfiltration from Frontier Software’s internal Australian corporate environment,"" the company said . ""We have not identified evidence of compromise or exfiltration outside this segmented environment."" The data that has been compromised according to the South Australian government includes the following: The only public entity that wasn't affected by the incident is the Department for Education, which does not use Frontier products. ""The highest of the high to the lowest of the low and all of the rest of us in between are potentially impacted, with the exception of teachers and the Department for Education,"" Lucas told ABC News after disclosing the data breach. ""Having the bank account details doesn't give you access to the bank account, but it's the first step in trying to crack a code in terms of passwords. ""We expect the state government to take all possible steps to review its cyber security measures in order to prevent such an event in the future."" Government employees affected by this incident are advised to treat incoming emails, calls, and SMS with caution. Additionally, everyone should reset their passwords and activate two-factor authentication where possible. Affected individuals should closely monitor bank statements and account activity and report any suspicious transactions to the authorities. Exposed people can take advantage of a free IDCARE cyber-security support service offering, following the instructions laid out on the incident announcement on the SA government website . Bleeping Computer has seen an announcement on Conti ransomware's data leak portal dated November 16, 2021, which matches the attack details shared by Frontier Software in their statement. However, the listing has since been removed from the portal, which probably means the negotiations have ended. Conti, a long-lived Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) operation , still manages to evade prosecution even after high-profile incidents against vital national resources such as Ireland's Department of Health . The gang is believed to be behind the recent revival of the notorious Emotet botnet, which could lead to a massive new wave of ransomware infections. This week, Conti took responsibility for the attack against Nordic Choice Hotels , a Scandinavian hotel chain with 200 properties.

CNA is considered the seventh-largest commercial insurance firm in the US based on stats from the Insurance Information Institute . The company provides an extensive array of insurance products, including cyber insurance policies, to individuals and businesses across the US, Canada, Europe, and Asia. ""The investigation revealed that the threat actor accessed certain CNA systems at various times from March 5, 2021 to March 21, 2021,"" CNA said in breach notification letters mailed to affected customers today. ""During this time period, the threat actor copied a limited amount information before deploying the ransomware."" The data breach reported by CNA affected 75,349 individuals, according to breach information filed with the office of Maine's Attorney General. After reviewing the files stolen during the attack, CNA discovered that they contained customers' personal information such as names and Social Security numbers. ""Having recovered the information, we have now completed our review of that information and have determined it contained some personal information including name, Social Security number and in some instances, information related to health benefits for certain individuals,"" CNA explained in a separate incident update . ""The majority of individuals being notified are current and former employees, contract workers and their dependents."" The company added that it found no evidence that the stolen information was ""viewed, retained or shared."" Additionally, CNA claims there is no reason to suspect that the stolen information was or will be misused in any way. CNA will be offering 24 months of complimentary credit monitoring and fraud protection services through Experian. CNA is also providing a toll-free hotline for the individuals to call with any questions regarding the Incident. — CNA Sources familiar with the attack told BleepingComputer that the Phoenix CryptoLocker operators encrypted over 15,000 devices after deploying ransomware payloads on CNA's network on March 21 . BleepingComputer also learned that the attackers encrypted the computers of remote workers who were logged into the company's VPN during the incident. Based on similarities in the code, Phoenix Locker is believed to be a new ransomware family developed by the Evil Corp hacking group to avoid sanctions after WastedLocker ransomware victims would no longer pay ransoms to avoid legal action or fines. When asked by BleepingComputer about a connection between the sanctioned Evil Corp and the Phoenix group, CNA replied that there was no confirmed nexus. ""The threat actor group, Phoenix, responsible for this attack, is not a sanctioned entity and no U.S. government agency has confirmed a relationship between the group that attacked CNA and any sanctioned entity,"" the company said. ""We have notified the FBI of this incident and are actively cooperating with them as they conduct their investigation of the incident."" Two months ago, CNA reported that it has restored the systems impacted in the ransomware attack and is operating ""in a fully restored state."" The insurance provider added that it did not find any evidence while investigating the incident of stolen policyholder info surfacing, being exchanged or being put up for sale on the dark web or hacking forums.

PurFoods' investigation revealed that the company had been breached on January 16th, 2023, and tools commonly used to steal data were found on the network. A more in-depth investigation concluded on July 10th, 2023, confirming the hackers had accessed the following data: The data breach impacts individuals who have received Mom's Meals packages, current and former employees, and independent contractors. According to the PurFoods data breach filing at the Office of the Maine Attorney General, the incident impacted 1,237,681 people.

E-commerce giant suffers major data breach in Codecov incident,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/e-commerce-giant-suffers-major-data-breach-in-codecov-incident/,Ax Sharma,"May 21, 2021","E-commerce platform Mercari has disclosed a major data breach incident that occurred due to exposure from the Codecov supply-chain attack. Mercari is a publicly traded Japanese company and an online marketplace that has recently expanded its operations to the United States and the United Kingdom. The Mercari app has scored over 100 million downloads worldwide as of 2017, and the company is the first in Japan to reach unicorn status . As earlier reported by BleepingComputer, popular code coverage tool Codecov had been a victim of a supply-chain attack that lasted for two months . During this two-month period, threat actors had modified the legitimate Codecov Bash Uploader tool to exfiltrate environment variables (containing sensitive information such as keys, tokens, and credentials) from Codecov customers' CI/CD environments. Using the credentials harvested from the tampered Bash Uploader, Codecov attackers reportedly breached hundreds of customer networks. Today, e-commerce giant Mercari has disclosed major impact from the Codecov supply-chain attack on its customer data. The company has confirmed that tens of thousands of customer records, including financial information, were exposed to external actors due to the Codecov breach. After concluding their investigation today, May 21st, Mercari states that the compromised records include: Mercari has illustrated the attack and how this data was exposed to third-party actors in the following infographic: Mercari became aware of the impact from the Codecov breach shortly after Codecov's initial disclosure made mid-April . On April 23rd, GitHub also notified Mercari of suspicious activity related to the incident seen on Mercari's repositories. The same day, Mercari began digging deeper and requested GitHub for detailed access logs. Eventually, Mercari staff determined that a malicious third party had acquired and misused their authentication credentials and accessed Mercari's private repositories between April 13th and April 18th. On discovery of this attack, Mercari immediately deactivated the compromised credentials and secrets and continued investigating the full impact of the breach. On April 27, Mercari discovered that some of its customer information and source code, stored in these GitHub repositories, had been illicitly accessed by unauthorized external parties. The company says it had to wait on disclosing the data breach until today because its investigation activities had been ongoing. And until any security weaknesses could be completely identified and remediated, the company risked suffering further attacks and damage. Mercari has now concluded its investigation and hence come forward with the detailed disclosure today. As observed by BleepingComputer, this week, the e-commerce giant also began purging its GitHub repositories from using Codecov anywhere: Prior to this, multiple Mercari repositories used the Codecov Bash Uploader that had been compromised, as confirmed by BleepingComputer: Mercari has individually contacted the people whose information has been compromised, and also notified relevant authorities, including the Personal Information Protection Commission, Japan, of this data breach: ""At the same time as this announcement, we will promptly provide individual information to those who are subject to the information leaked due to this matter, and we have also set up a dedicated contact point for inquiries regarding this matter."" ""In the future, we will continue to implement further security enhancement measures and investigate this matter while utilizing the knowledge of external security experts, and will promptly report any new information that should be announced."" ""We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience and concern caused by this matter,"" says Mercari in a rough translation of its original press release . Today's disclosure comes after multiple companies have recently come forward with the impact of the Codecov supply-chain attack on their private repositories. These include software manufacturer HashiCorp , cloud communications platform Twilio , cloud services provider Confluent , insurance company Coalition , U.S. cybersecurity firm Rapid7 , and workflow management platform Monday.com . Last month, Codecov also began sending additional notifications to the impacted customers and disclosed a thorough list of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) , i.e. attacker IP addresses associated with this supply-chain attack. Codecov users should scan their CI/CD environments and networks for any signs of compromise, and as a safeguard, rotate any and all secrets that may have been exposed.

According to a data breach notification email from Koodo Mobile that was seen by BleepingComputer, their systems were hacked on February 13th, 2020, and an unauthorized person stole customer data from August and September 2017 that contains mobile account numbers and telephone numbers. ""What happened: On February 13, 2020, an unauthorized third party using compromised credentials accessed our systems and copied August/September 2017 data that included your mobility account number and telephone number. It is possible that the information exposed has changed since 2017, in which case your current information is not compromised,"" the email stated. This information can be used by scammers to port Koodo Mobile numbers to attacker's devices to receive 2-factor authentication codes, which could allow attackers to gain access to email and bank accounts. To prevent this, Koodo has enabled the 'Port Protection' feature on the affected accounts, which prevents attackers from porting a Koodo Mobile number to another carrier unless the account holder first calls and requests it to be done. The email goes on to say that Koodo Mobile has found evidence that the stolen customer information is being sold online, but feels their Port Protection feature will protect their customer's mobile number from being used for fraudulent purposes. ""We have found evidence that the unauthorized third party is offering the information for sale on the dark web. With port protection in place, we do not believe that your information could be used for any fraudulent purposes. Nevertheless, we have reported this incident to Law Enforcement and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada and we are working closely with them on this matter,"" the Koodo notification warned. They then contradict themselves later in the notification by saying that affected users should not use their mobile number for two-factor authentication due to this data breach. ""We also recommend that you not register your mobile telephone number on online accounts. If you have done so, you may want to remove it and use an alternative method to receive One Time Passcodes or 2 Factor Authentication codes,"" the email continues. Raveed Laeb of cybersecurity intelligence firm, KELA has told BleepingComputer that Koodo accounts are being sold on various dark web web sites. ""A different market - one that specializes in automated selling of access to compromised accounts - currently offers over 21,000 Koodo accounts,"" Laeb told BleepingComputer. ""As can be seen in the image in the third from the right column, this market also indicates the date in which the account was uploaded. Breaking down accounts scraped from the market by date, we can see an uptick in February,"" Laeb explained. Unfortunately, with the amount of information leaked by data breaches, it may be too easy for an attacker to find enough information online about a particular customer so that they can bypass the Port Protection feature. Due to this, it is strongly advised that you use another 2FA method for securing online accounts. Otherwise, you may run into a similar problem as the one reported by this Koodo customer in the past. Affected users should also be on the lookout for mobile SMS phishing (smishing) scams that pretend to be Koodo and utilize information obtained from this breach.

In its original statement, last month, the company said that only 400,000 UK citizens were affected. The company says the cyber-security firm it brought in to investigate the breach found evidence that hackers got their hands on more data than initially believed. The stolen files contained records the company created between 2011 and 2016. Equifax says that for approximately 14.5 million of the 15.2 million affected, the stolen records contained only a small amount of information, limited to name and dates of birth. Exhaustive personal details were included for 693,665 records that hackers managed to steal. Equifax says it already started notifying these customers by post mail. The table below lists the personal details exposed for the set of 693,665 records. 12,086 consumers who had an email address associated with their Equifax.co.uk account in 2014 accessed 14,961 consumers who had portions of their Equifax.co.uk membership details such as username, password, secret questions and answers and partial credit card details - from 2014 accessed 29,188 consumers who had their driving licence number accessed We will offer Equifax Protect for free. This is an identity protection service which monitors personal data. Products and services from third party organisations will also be offered at no cost to consumers. In addition to the services set-out above, further information will be outlined in the correspondence. 637,430 consumers who had their phone numbers accessed Consumers who had a phone number accessed will be offered a leading identity monitoring service for free. The UK National Cyber Security Centre also issued a statement today, with recommendations for affected customers, informing them of the dangers of phishing and online fraud. Equifax also made it clear that it would not be calling affected customers. UK users should not give out personal details to anyone calling claiming to be an Equifax employee. This is the second time that Equifax amends its original breach estimate — 143 million US customers, 400,000 UK customers, 100,000 Canadian customers. Last week, the company said it discovered an additional 2.5 million affected US customers and reduced the number of affected Canadian users from 100,000 to around 8,000. Also last week, Equifax's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Rick Smith resigned his position. Two weeks earlier, the company announced the immediate retirement of their Chief Information Officer (CIO) and Chief Security Officer (CSO). Smith also attended a Senate Banking Committee hearing on the Equifax breach, during which he blamed the incident on a lowly IT worker who forgot to patch the breached server for an Apache Struts vulnerability . Despite Smith's statements, someone dressed as the Monopoly Man stole the show at the Senate hearing. Despite Equifax's huge security failures, the IRS awarded the company a $7.25 million contract to help the agency prevent fraud.

The attacker claims to have stolen source code for D-Link's D-View network management software, along with millions of entries containing personal information of customers and employees, including details on the company's CEO. The stolen data allegedly includes names, emails, addresses, phone numbers, account registration dates, and the users' last sign-in dates. The threat actor provided samples of 45 stolen records with timestamps between 2012 and 2013, which prompted another participant in the thread to comment on the fact that the data looked very old. ""I have breached the internal network of D-Link in Taiwan, I have 3 million lines of customer information, as well as source code to D-View extracted from system,"" the attacker said. ""This does include the information of MANY government officials in Taiwan, as well as the CEOs and employees of the company."" The data has been available for purchase on the hacking forum since October 1st, with the threat actor demanding $500 for the stolen customer information and the alleged D-View source code. D-Link said the security breach occurred due to an employee falling victim to a phishing attack, granting the attacker access to the company's network. In response to the breach, the company immediately shut down potentially impacted servers and disabled all but two user accounts used during the investigation. While it confirmed the breach, D-Link specified that the intruder accessed a product registration system within what it described as a ""test lab environment,"" operating on an outdated D-View 6 system that reached the end of life in 2015. The reason why an end-of-life server was still operational on D-Link’s network, potentially remaining exposed to Internet access for seven years, remains unclear. Contrary to the attacker's claim of stealing millions of users' data, D-Link said the compromised system contained roughly 700 records, with info on accounts that have been for at least seven years. ""Based on the investigations, however, it only contained approximately 700 outdated and fragmented records that had been inactive for at least seven years,"" D-Link said . ""These records originated from a product registration system that reached its end of life in 2015. Furthermore, the majority of the data consisted of low-sensitivity and semi-public information."" D-Link also suspects the threat actor deliberately tampered with the recent login timestamps to create the illusion of a more recent data theft.

The undefeated record was logged in 2015, the year when the Anthem and Premera Blue Cross health insurers declared data breaches ( 1 , 2 ) that compromised personal information belonging to 78.8 million and 11 million customers respectively. Last month, providers of healthcare services and plans, and businesses related to the sector in 24 states reported data breaches to HHS' Office for Civil Rights. Most of the incidents, 17 of them, were in Texas. The top two organizations with the highest largest number of records affected were Betty Jean Kerr People’s Health Centers (152,000) and Kalispell Regional Healthcare (140,209). However, in the case of Betty Jean the records do not appear to have been exposed to an unauthorized party but lost to a ransomware attack, so the files were encrypted. The organization decided not to pay the ransom to recover them and could not restore them from backups. 28 of the incidents were caused by unauthorized access or disclosure, while 18 of them originated from hacking or IT incidents. This shows that the healthcare industry is still a target that is both appealing and easy to attack. HHS' Office for Civil Rights (OCR) also issued financial penalties for some of the entities affected by the cyber incidents. One of them ended with a settlement for publicly disclosing health information in response to a review on Yelp. Following an investigation, OCR also established that the practice did not include sufficient information in its notice of privacy practices. Both parties agreed to $10,000 settlement. Another ended with a civil monetary sanction of more than $2 million for allowing public disclosure of a photo of an operating room display that showed health details of two individuals, one of them being ""a well-known NFL star.""

"Healthcare Services Group data breach impacts 624,000 people",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/healthcare-services-group-data-breach-impacts-624-000-people/#comment_form,Bill Toulas,"August 27, 2025","The Healthcare Services Group (HSGI) is alerting more than 600,000 individuals that their personal information was exposed in a security breach last year. The healthcare services provider stated that it detected unauthorized access to its network on October 7, 2024, and subsequently discovered that the intrusion had begun on September 27. The investigation that followed revealed that the intruders had exfiltrated data from the systems they had accessed. “The investigation determined that an unauthorized actor may have accessed and copied certain files on our computer systems between September 27, 2024, and October 3, 2024,” reads the notification . “As a result, we undertook an extensive review of the involved files to determine whether they contained sensitive information and to whom the information relates.” This process took roughly ten months, as impacted individuals received notifications about the data breach only on August 25, 2025. Healthcare Services Group is a publicly traded company in Pennsylvania that specializes in providing support services to healthcare facilities across the United States. The organization has an annual revenue of $1.7 billion, and its services are of strategic importance to the safe and smooth functioning of thousands of healthcare facilities in the country. The types of data compromised in this incident, varies per individual, and may include: The organization stated that, as of now, there's no evidence of any misuse of the stolen information. HSGI offers 12 and 24-month credit monitoring and identity theft protection services coverage to individuals affected by the breach, depending on the severity of the exposed data. In addition to this, the company recommends that people remain vigilant for phishing and scamming attempts and report suspicious activity on their banking accounts to the authorities. As of writing, no ransomware groups have claimed the attack on HSGI.

Allianz Life says July data breach impacts 1.5 million people,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/allianz-life-says-july-data-breach-impacts-15-million-people/,Bill Toulas,"October 1, 2025","Allianz Life has completed the investigation into the cyberattack it suffered in July and determined that nearly 1.5 million individuals are impacted. The American insurance giant has notified all potentially affected individuals that their names, addresses, dates of birth, and social security numbers (SSN) has been compromised. Allianz Life is part of Allianz SE and provides annuities and life insurance for more than 1.4 million Americans. Allianz SE, which is a global giant with over 125 million customers, was not impacted. In late July, the American insurance company informed the public that it had suffered a data breach impacting most of its customers , after a threat actor gained access to a third-party cloud-based CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system they used. Although not officially confirmed, BleepingComputer has learned that the attack was likely part of the Salesforce attack wave conducted by the ShinyHunters extortion group. Three weeks after the attack was disclosed, the Have I Been Pwned service noted that number of impacted individuals was 1.1 million , based on the breached data it obtained. The company is now informing affected customers and shared the data breach notification with U.S. authorities. The total number of persons impacted by the cyberattack is 1,497,036 and includes customers, financial professionals, and employees. “On July 16, 2025, a malicious threat actor gained access to a cloud-based system used by Allianz Life,” reads the notice . “The threat actor was able to obtain certain personal information related to Allianz Life customers, financial professionals, and select Allianz Life employees.” Although Have I Been Pwned previously reported that the incident resulted in the compromise of email addresses, names, genders, dates of birth, phone numbers, and physical addresses, the the insurance company only lists names, addresses, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers. Allianz Life enclosed instructions on how to enroll in a two-year free-of-charge identity theft monitoring service by Kroll, to somewhat mitigate the risk for the letter recipients. The company has also established a dedicated support team, reachable by phone, which is ready to answer any customer questions regarding the incident. Potentially impacted individuals are advised to remain vigilant against unsolicited communications, enable credit monitoring, and consider placing a credit freeze.

Leading Indian fintech platform MobiKwik denies data breach,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/leading-indian-fintech-platform-mobikwik-denies-data-breach/,Sergiu Gatlan,"March 30, 2021","Indian digital financial services platform Mobikwik denies claims that almost 8 TB of data put up for sale was allegedly stolen from its servers. This privately held fintech platform provides financial services and a phone-based payment gateway to more than 120 million users. Mobikwik says that approximately 3 million merchants and over 300 billers are currently using its services. Security researcher Rajshekhar Rajaharia discovered a threat actor attempting to sell what he claimed to be a database of sensitive info stolen from MobiKwik after having access to the company's servers since January 2021. After Rajaharia revealed his findings on Twitter last month, MobiKwik denied having been affected by this massive data breach, saying that Rajaharia wants to ""grab media attention."" The company also said that ""user and company data is completely safe and secure"" since an investigation "" did not find any security lapses."" MobiKwik added that its ""legal team will be pursuing strict action against this so-called researcher who is trying to malign our brand reputation for ulterior motives."" The data allegedly stolen from MobiKwik contains personal and financial information (addresses, phone numbers, emails, and hashed passwords) of almost 100 million individuals, and bank accounts and card details of around 40 million. The database being sold online also includes the KYC ( Know Your Customer ) data of roughly 3.5 million Indians. The threat actor who put the allegedly stolen data up for sale also created a search portal to allow anyone to check if their data is included in the stolen data. The search field has since been removed due to a large amount of traffic and to add a captcha for blocking bots trying to scrape the data. Today, the company doubled down on their previous statement, denying again that the data breach ever happened and saying that customers who found their data exposed on the dark web might've uploaded the data themselves. ""Some users have reported that their data is visible on the darkweb,"" MobiKwik said in a statement published today. ""While we are investigating this, it is entirely possible that any user could have uploaded her/ his information on multiple platforms. ""Hence, it is incorrect to suggest that the data available on the darkweb has been accessed from MobiKwik or any identified source."" MobiKwik says that external security experts found no evidence of a data breach following a thorough investigation since the breach was reported by Rajaharia last month. The fintech platform will also hire third-party experts for a security audit, although its services have most likely not been breached. ""The company is closely working with requisite authorities, and is confident that security protocols to store sensitive data are robust and have not been breached,"" MobiKwik said. ""Considering the seriousness of the allegations, and by way of abundant caution, it will get a third party to conduct a forensic data security audit."" MobiKwik also reinsured customers that their accounts are safe and that their financial information is stored in encrypted form. Over ten years ago, MobiKwik suffered a breach after attackers gained access to some of its servers and sent emails offering to sell confidential info belonging to MobiKwik users.

The biggest cybersecurity and cyberattack stories of 2023,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-biggest-cybersecurity-and-cyberattack-stories-of-2023/#comment_form,Lawrence Abrams,"January 1, 2024","2023 was a big year for cybersecurity, with significant cyberattacks, data breaches, new threat groups emerging, and, of course, zero-day vulnerabilities. Some stories, though, were more impactful or popular with our 22 million readers than others. Below are fourteen of what BleepingComputer believes are the most impactful cybersecurity stories of 2023, with a summary of each. Genetic testing provider 23andMe suffered credential stuffing attacks that led to a major data breach, exposing the data of 6.9 million users. The company states that the attackers only breached a small number of accounts during the credential-stuffing attacks. However, the threat actors were able to abuse other features to scrape millions of individuals' data. The threat actors attempted to sell the stolen data, but after not receiving buyers, leaked the data for 1 million Ashkenazi Jews and 4,011,607 people living in Great Britain on a hacking forum. In a recent update, 23andMe told BleepingComputer that the breach impacted 6.9 million people — 5.5 million through the DNA Relatives feature and 1.4 million through the Family Tree feature. This breach has led to multiple class action lawsuits against the company for not adequately protecting data. Two Danish hosting providers were forced to shut down after a ransomware attack encrypted the majority of customer data, and data restoration was not successful. ""Since we neither can nor wish to meet the financial demands of the criminal hackers for a ransom, CloudNordic's IT team and external experts have been working intensively to assess the damage and determine what could be recovered,"" reads CloudNordic's statement (machine translated) ""Sadly, it has been impossible to recover more data, and the majority of our customers have consequently lost all their data with us."" A hacktivist group known as Anonymous Sudan took everyone by surprise when their DDoS attacks took down the websites and services of some of the largest tech firms in the world. The group's attacks gained wide media attention when they successfully took down login pages for Microsoft's services, including Outlook , OneDrive , and the Azure portal . Over a week later, Microsoft finally confirmed that DDoS attacks caused these outages. ""Beginning in early June 2023, Microsoft identified surges in traffic against some services that temporarily impacted availability,"" confirmed Microsoft . ""Microsoft promptly opened an investigation and subsequently began tracking ongoing DDoS activity by the threat actor that Microsoft tracks as Storm-1359."" Anonymous Sudan later targeted numerous other websites, including those for ChatGPT , Cloudflare , and U.S. government services. The increasing DDoS attacks and their impact led the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to release an advisory about these incidents. A team of researchers from British universities trained a deep learning model to steal data from keyboard keystrokes recorded using a microphone with an accuracy of 95%. When Zoom was used for training the sound classification algorithm, the prediction accuracy dropped to 93%, which is still extremely high. To mitigate these attacks, the researchers suggest users may try altering typing styles or using randomized passwords. Other defense measures include using software to reproduce keystroke sounds, play white noise, or software-based keystroke audio filters. PayPal suffered a credential stuffing attack between December 6 and December 8, 2022, allowing attackers to access 34,942 accounts. Credential stuffing is an attack where hackers attempt to access an account by trying out username and password pairs sourced from data leaks on various websites. Hackers had access to account holders' full names, dates of birth, postal addresses, social security numbers, and individual tax identification numbers. American T.V. giant and satellite broadcast provider DISH Network mysteriously went offline earlier this year, with its websites and mobile apps not working for days. DISH later confirmed that the outage was caused by a ransomware attack , with BleepingComputer first to report that the Black Basta ransomware gang was behind the attack. Employees told BleepingComputer that the ransomware gang compromised the company's Windows domain controllers and encrypted VMware ESXi servers and backups. DISH data breach notifications confirmed that data was stolen in the attack and hinted that a ransom was paid not to release the stolen data. ""We are not aware of any misuse of your information, and we have received confirmation that the extracted data has been deleted,"" read the data breach notification . Web hosting giant GoDaddy says it suffered a multi-year breach allowing unknown attackers to steal source code and install malware on its servers. This breach began in 2021 and allowed the threat actors access to the personal information of 1.2 million Managed WordPress customers, including credentials, and also used the access to redirect websites to other domains. No threat actors ever claimed responsibility for this attack. MGM Resorts International suffered a massive attack that impacted numerous systems, including its main website, online reservations, and in-casino services, like ATMs, slot machines, and credit card machines. The BlackCat ransomware operation claimed the attack, whose affiliates said they encrypted over 100 ESXi hypervisors during the incident. Bloomberg reported that the same group also breached Caesars Entertainment's network , providing a strong hint in a Form 8-K SEC filing that they paid the attackers to prevent a leak of customers' stolen data. While the attack was significant, it also brought wide attention to a loose-knit group of hackers known as Scattered Spider. Scattered Spider, also known as 0ktapus , Starfraud, UNC3944 , and Muddled Libra , is adept at social engineering and relies on phishing, multi-factor authentication (MFA) bombing (targeted MFA fatigue), and SIM swapping to gain initial network access on large organizations. Members of this collective are affiliates of the BlackCat ransomware gang and include young English-speaking members with diverse skill sets who frequent the same hacking forums and Telegram channels. While many believe this is a cohesive gang, the group is a network of individuals, with different threat actors participating in each attack. This fluid structure is what makes it challenging to track them. In November, the FBI released an advisory highlighting the group's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Scattered Spider is behind previous attacks on Reddit , MailChimp , Twilio , DoorDash , and Riot Games . 3CX was breached by the North Korean Lazarus hacking group to push malware through a supply chain attack using the company's Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) desktop client. 3CX is a VoIP IPBX software development company whose 3CX Phone System is used by more than 350,000 companies worldwide and has over 12 million daily users. 3CX was breached after an employee installed a trojanized version of Trading Technologies' X_TRADER software, which allowed the threat actors to steal corporate credentials and breach the network . The attackers pushed out a malicious software update that installed a previously unknown information-stealing malware to steal data and credentials stored in Chrome, Edge, Brave, and Firefox user profiles. In May, Barracuda disclosed that some of their Email Security Gateway (ESG) appliances were hacked using a zero-day vulnerability to install malware and steal data. We later learned that the attacks were linked to Chinese threat actors , who used the vulnerability since 2022 to infect ESG devices with new malware named 'Saltwater,' 'Seaspy,' and 'Seaside.' CISA later disclosed that Submarine and Whirlpool malware were also used in the attacks to backdoor ESG devices. What stood out from these attacks is that instead of using a software fix for impacted ESG devices, Barracuda warned customers they must replace their Email Security Gateway (ESG) appliances , which was done free of charge. ""Impacted ESG appliances must be immediately replaced regardless of patch version level,"" the company warned at the time. ""Barracuda's remediation recommendation at this time is full replacement of the impacted ESG."" This unusual request led many to believe that the threat actors compromised the devices at a low level, making it impossible to ensure they were completely clean. Mandiant, who was part of the incident response in these attacks, told BleepingComputer that this was recommended out of caution, as Barracuda could not ensure the complete removal of malware. In February 2023, a massive ransomware campaign targeted exposed VMware ESXi servers worldwide, quickly encrypting the virtual machines for thousands of companies. Just hours after the attack, victims began reporting in the BleepingComputer's forum that files with vmxf, .vmx, .vmdk, .vmsd, and .nvram, all files associated with VMware ESXi virtual machines, were encrypted. The ransomware campaign was dubbed ESXiArgs due to an .args file being created for every encrypted file. The VMware ESXi console home page was modified to show a ransom note demanding 2.0781 bitcoins, worth approximately $49,000 at the time. One of BleepingComputer's most-read stories of the year was the news that the Brazilian National Telecommunications Agency seized incoming Flipper Zero purchases for their potential to be used in criminal activity. Brazilians who purchased the Flipper Zero reported that their shipments were redirected to Brazil's telecommunications agency, Anatel, due to a lack of certification with the country's Radio Frequencies department. From emails seen by BleepingComputer, Anatel flagged the device as a tool used for criminal purposes. In June, researchers from Kaspersky first disclosed a new zero-click iOS attack called "" Operation Triangulation "" used to install the TriangleDB spyware on iPhones. Kaspersky discovered the attack on devices within its own network, and Russia's FSB intelligence service accused Apple of providing the NSA with a backdoor. However, the true origins of the attack remain unknown, and there is no proof that the U.S. government is behind the attacks. The attacks start with the hackers sending a malicious iMessage attachment that, when processed by iOS, automatically triggers a zero-click exploit chain. A zero-click exploit means it does not require interaction from the user to be triggered. The attacks chained together four zero-day iOS vulnerabilities listed below to install the spyware: Last week, Kaspersky disclosed that the final zero-day vulnerability, CVE-2023-38606, abused an undocumented feature in Apple chips to bypass hardware-based security protections. While the Operation Triangulation attacks did not impact many devices, it could be one of the most sophisticated iOS attacks seen to date. While it's still unknown who is behind the attacks, their sophistication has led cybersecurity researchers to believe that a government-sponsored hacking group is behind them. BleepingComputer was the first to report the widespread data-theft attacks exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in the MOVEit Transfer secure file transfer platform. MOVEit Transfer is a managed file transfer (MFT) solution developed by Ipswitch, a subsidiary of US-based Progress Software Corporation, that allows the enterprise to securely transfer files between business partners and customers using SFTP, SCP, and HTTP-based uploads. While the vulnerability was patched in May 2023, the threat actors had already utilized it as a zero-day to breach MOVEit Transfer servers and download the stored data. The attacks were soon claimed by the Clop ransomware gang , who previously launched similar attacks through zero-day vulnerabilities in Accellion FTA and GoAnywhere . According to Emsisoft , 2,706 organizations were breached using this vulnerability, exposing the personal data of over 93 million people.

"Optus breach victims will get ""supercharged"" fraud protection",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/optus-breach-victims-will-get-supercharged-fraud-protection/#comment_form,Sergiu Gatlan,"September 30, 2022","The Australian Federal Police (AFP) announced today the launch of Operation Guardian to ensure that more than 10,000 customers who had their info leaked in the Optus data breach will get priority protection against fraud attempts. This operation was set up under the Joint Policing Cybercrime Coordination Centre (JPC3), a partnership that allows law enforcement, the private sector, and industry to join efforts and fight cybercrime. Throughout Operation Guardian, JPC3 members can use full and collective legislative powers and investigative and intelligence capabilities of all Australian policing jurisdictions to help boost the breach victims' protection against fraudsters. ""The AFP and state and territory police have set up Operation Guardian to supercharge the protection of more than 10,000 customers whose identification credentials have been unlawfully released online under the Optus data breach,"" the AFP said . ""Customers affected by the breach will receive multi-jurisdictional and multi-layered protection from identity crime and financial fraud. The 10,000 individuals, who potentially had 100 points of identification released online, will be prioritised."" As the AFP explained, Operation Guardian will focus on multiple measures that would help shield affected customers, including: Cybercriminals are already using the personal information leaked online after Optus, Australia's second-largest mobile operator, was hacked earlier this month. ""Scammers are now sending phishing emails and text messages to victims requesting money to be sent to prevent their credentials been used fraudulently,"" said Detective Chief Inspector Darren Fielke. ""Do not respond to any of these requests for money or requests for the purchase of gift cards."" Optus disclosed the security breach on September 22, saying that an unknown attacker might have gained access to some of its customers' sensitive personal information. This info includes customer names, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, physical addresses, driver's licenses, and passport numbers, but no financial information or account passwords. The next day, a threat actor named 'optusdata' published a sample of the stolen data (containing the record of 10,200 Optus customers) on the Breached hacking forum and demanded a $USD1,000,000 ransom so the data for 11,000,000 customers would not be leaked online. Today's announcement comes after the hacker who claimed to have breached Optus and stole the data of 11 million customers has withdrawn their extortion demands after landing in law enforcement crosshairs. The threat actor has also apologized to the thousands of people whose personal data they leaked on a hacking forum. ""Too many eyes. We will not sale data to anyone. We can't if we even want to: personally deleted data from drive (only copy),"" the threat actor said. ""Sorry too 10.200 Australian whos data was leaked."" The attacker's decision was likely forced by the AFP announcing the launch of Operation Hurricane to identify the threat actors behind the Optus breach and the extortion demand. ""We are aware of reports of stolen data being sold on the dark web and that is why the AFP is monitoring the dark web using a range of specialist capabilities,"" the AFP said . ""Criminals, who use pseudonyms and anonymising technology, can't see us but I can tell you that we can see them."" Since the breach, Optus has continuously shared up-to-date information on the investigation with its customers via a dedicated portal .

Framework discloses data breach after accountant gets phished,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/framework-discloses-data-breach-after-accountant-gets-phished/#comment_form,Sergiu Gatlan,"January 11, 2024","Framework Computer disclosed a data breach exposing the personal information of an undisclosed number of customers after Keating Consulting Group, its accounting service provider, fell victim to a phishing attack. The California-based manufacturer of upgradeable and modular laptops says a Keating Consulting accountant was tricked on January 11 by a threat actor impersonating Framework's CEO into sharing a spreadsheet containing customers' personally identifiable information (PII) ""associated with outstanding balances for Framework purchases."" ""On January 9th, at 4:27am PST, the attacker sent an email to the accountant impersonating our CEO asking for Accounts Receivable information pertaining to outstanding balances for Framework purchases,"" the company says in data breach notification letters sent to affected individuals. ""On January 11th at 8:13am PST, the accountant responded to the attacker and provided a spreadsheet with the following information: Full Name, Email Address, Balance Owed. ""Note that this list was primarily of a subset of open pre-orders, but some completed past orders with pending accounting syncs were also included in this list."" Framework says its Head of Finance notified Keating Consulting's leadership of the attack once he became aware of the breach roughly 29 minutes after the external accountant replied to the attacker's emails at 8:42 AM PST on January 11th. As part of a subsequent investigation, the company identified all customers whose information was exposed in the attack and notified them of the incident via email. Since the exposed data includes the names of customers, their email addresses, and their outstanding balances, it could potentially be used in phishing attacks that impersonate the company to request payment information or redirect to malicious websites designed to gather even more sensitive information from those impacted. The company added that it only sends emails from 'support@frame.work' asking customers to update their information when a payment has failed and it never asks for payment information via email. Customers are urged to contact the company's support team about any suspicious emails they receive. Framework says that from now on, all Keating Consulting employees with access to Framework customer information will be required to have mandatory phishing and social engineering attack training. ""We are also auditing their standard operating procedures around information requests,"" the company added. ""We are additionally auditing the trainings and standard operating procedures of all other accounting and finance consultants who currently or previously have had access to customer information.""

Dymocks Booksellers suffers data breach impacting 836k customers,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dymocks-booksellers-suffers-data-breach-impacting-836k-customers/#comment_form,Bill Toulas,"September 8, 2023","Dymocks Booksellers is warning customers their personal information was exposed in a data breach after the company's database was shared on hacking forums. Dymocks is a bookstore chain operating 65 stores in Australia, New Zealand, and Hong Kong, and also an online shop that sells printed books, e-books, stationery supplies, games, and digital media. The company was informed that its customer data was stolen on September 6th, 2023, by Troy Hunt, the creator of the data breach notification service 'Have I Been Pwned' (HIBP), after a threat actor released it on a hacking forum. In a notice posted to Dymocks' website , the book retailer explains that they see no evidence of penetration on its computer systems, and they're currently investigating a potential security breach on third-party partners. As such, how the data was obtained, the duration of unauthorized access, the extent of malicious activity, and the exact scope of the impact of this incident remain unclear. The investigation carried out by Dymocks and contracted experts has so far confirmed that the following types of customer information have been compromised: Dymocks clarified that it does not store customer financial information, so no such details have been exposed. Have I Been Pwned has confirmed that the data leaked online consists of 1.2 million user records for 836,120 unique Dymocks accounts. All relevant authorities have been notified about the incident, and Dymocks is currently working towards completing its investigation and implementing additional security measures to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future. Also, Dymocks assures clients that it is still safe to make purchases on its online shop. However, it recommends that users change their account password. Troy Hunt reports that Dymocks customer data has been circulated in various Telegram channels and hacking forums since at least June 2023. That said, cybercriminals had plenty of opportunity to exploit the leaked dataset in phishing and scamming attacks targeting the bookstore's clients. BleepingComputer has found a post on one of the BreachForums hacking forum's latest reboots posted on September 3rd, 2023, offering access to the stolen database to other forum members for a few dollars. While it does not appear that passwords were exposed in the Dymocks data breach, it is strongly advised that users change their passwords on the site to be safe. Furthermore, if the same password was used at other sites, it should also be changed there. When changing your passwords, use a unique and strong password at every site so that a data breach does not affect your account at other companies. A password manager can make it much easier to use unique passwords at every site and is highly recommended. Finally, as this data was essentially released for free, Dymocks customers should be on the lookout for emails asking for a credit card or login information, as it could be targeted phishing scams resulting from this data breach.

Healthcare software provider data breach impacts 2.7 million,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/healthcare-software-provider-data-breach-impacts-27-million/#comment_form,Bill Toulas,"December 20, 2023","ESO Solutions, a provider of software products for healthcare organizations and fire departments, disclosed that data belonging to 2.7 million patients has been compromised as a result of a ransomware attack. According to the notification, the intrusion occurred on September 28 and resulted in data being exfiltrated before the hackers encrypted a number of company systems. During the investigation of the incident, ESO Solutions discovered that the attackers accessed one machine that contained sensitive personal data. On October 23, the company determined that the data breach caused by the ransomware attack impacted patients associated with its customers, including hospitals and clinics in the U.S. The type of data exposed includes the following: The exact types of data exposed vary per individual, depending on the details the patients provided to the healthcare organizations using ESO’s software and the care services they received. The software vendor has informed the FBI and state authorities of the incident. All impacted customers were notified on December 12 , and some of the affected hospitals started sending notice s of a breach to their patients in the days that followed . “At this time, we do not have evidence that your information has been misused,” reads the notification to impacted patients . To mitigate the risk of the data breach, ESO offers 12 months of identity monitoring service coverage through Kroll to all notice recipients. As of writing, the following healthcare providers are confirmed as impacted by the ransomware attack at ESO: From what BleepingComputer could find, no ransomware have taken responsibility for the ESO attack.

Australian Clinical Labs says patient data stolen in ransomware attack,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/australian-clinical-labs-says-patient-data-stolen-in-ransomware-attack/,Bill Toulas,"October 27, 2022","Australian Clinical Labs (ACL) has disclosed a February 2022 data breach that impacted its Medlab Pathology business, exposing the medical records and other sensitive information of 223,000 people. ACL is an Australian healthcare company that operates 89 laboratories and performs six million tests annually, offering its services to 92 private and public hospitals across Australia. While the firm says it’s not aware of any misuse of the stolen information, it is notifying all impacted clients individually of what data was exposed in the attack. A data breach incident notification published today gives the following summary of leaked data: Australia’s Cyber Security Center (ACSC) and the Office of the Information Commissioner (OAIC) have already been notified about the incident earlier in the year, with ACSC initially warning MedLab that hackers posted their data to the dark web. All impacted individuals will also be offered free-of-charge credit monitoring and identity theft protection services, while ACL will cover the costs of ID document replacements where needed. The ransomware gang that took responsibility for the attack on Medlab Pathology is Quantum, which uploaded all stolen files on its Tor site on June 14, 2022. The threat actors leaked 86GB of data, including patient and employee details, financial reports, invoices, contracts, forms, subpoenas, and other private documents. According to Quantum ransomware’s website, the data leak page for MedLab has been accessed 130,000 times. The disclosure of a cybersecurity incident nine months after it happened isn’t a rapid response, and ACL’s announcement includes a section that attempts to justify this delay. When MedLab detected unauthorized access to its network in February 2022, the firm conducted a forensic investigation which they say didn’t reveal anything worrying. In March 2022, ACSC contacted ACL after receiving intelligence that the incident they had suffered was a ransomware attack. In June 2022, the ACSC notified MedLab that the ransomware gang posted the stolen data to a data leak site. So, according to the company, it took them roughly five months to even realize someone had exfiltrated files from their systems. As for the four more months from that point until today’s disclosure, ACL says the data set was too complicated to quickly determine what customers were affected. “Given the highly complex and unstructured nature of the data set being investigated, it has taken the forensic analysts and experts until now to determine the individuals and the nature of their information involved,” explains ACL . Sydney-based reporter Jeremy Kirk tweeted that sources examining the leaked data confirmed it was unstructured but not to the point of taking months to analyze. Over the past two months, Australia has been hit with numerous data breaches and cyberattacks, including attacks on Optus , Medibank , MyDeal , and Vinomofo . While hackers are likely not specifically targeting organizations in the country, the Australian government is proposing new data protection laws to provide greater insight into data breaches and to impose more significant fines on companies not adequately protecting data.

ADT is a public American company that specializes in security and smart home solutions for residential and small business customers. The firm employs 14,300 people, has an annual revenue of $4.98 billion, and serves approximately 6 million customers across 200 locations in the United States. In a Thursday morning Form 8-K regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), ADT says threat actors breached some of its databases and stole customer information. ""ADT Inc. recently experienced a cybersecurity incident during which unauthorized actors illegally accessed certain databases containing ADT customer order information,"" reads the 8-K filing . ""After becoming aware of the incident, the Company promptly took steps to shut down the unauthorized access and launched an investigation, partnering with leading third-party cybersecurity industry experts."" ""The attackers nonetheless obtained some limited customer information, including email addresses, phone numbers, and postal addresses."" An investigation into the breach revealed that the exposed data includes limited customer information, email addresses, and locations. Despite the cybersecurity incident, ADT says there is no evidence that customers' home security systems have been compromised. Also, ADT does not believe the attackers stole customers' credit card data or banking information. ADT noted that affected people represent a small percentage of the company's overall client base; however, they did not provide any figures. While ADT did not share many details about the attack, on July 31st, a threat actor known as 'netnsher' leaked customer data allegedly stolen from ADT. The threat actor says the leaked data includes 30,800 customer records, including customer emails, complete addresses, user IDs, and the products purchased. In early July, another threat actor claimed to have leaked corporate files stolen from ADT in 2020-2023, but it is not believed to be related to this incident.

BigBasket is a popular Indian online grocery delivery service that allows people to shop online for food and deliver it to their homes. This morning, a well-known seller of data breaches known as ShinyHunters posted a database for free on a hacker forum that he claims was stolen from BigBasket. In November 2020, BigBasket confirmed to Bloomberg News that they had suffered a data breach after ShinyHunter had previously tried to sell the stolen data in private sales. “There’s been a data breach and we’ve filed a case with the cybercrime police,” BigBasket CEO Hari Menon told Bloomberg News . “The investigators have asked us not to reveal any details as it might hamper the probe.” As is typical for older breaches privately sold by ShinyHunters, the threat actor has now released the whole database for free, which reportedly contains more than 20 million user records. Infamous threat actor ShinyHunters just leaked the database of BigBasket, a famous Indian online grocery delivery service. ( @bigbasket_com ) 20,000,000+ clients affected and information such as emails, names, hashed passwords, birthdates and phone numbers were leaked. pic.twitter.com/tD5TMxNkH7 The database includes BigBasket customer information, including email addresses, SHA1 hashed passwords, addresses, phone numbers, and other assorted information. The passwords are hashed using the SHA1 algorithm, and forum members have claimed to crack 2 million of the listed passwords already. Another member claims that 700k of the customers used the password 'password' for their accounts. In the past, ShinyHunters has been responsible for or involved in other data breaches, including Tokopedia , TeeSpring , Minted , Chatbooks , Dave , Promo , Mathway , Wattpad , and many more. As BleepingComputer has confirmed that some of the records are accurate, including information specific to the BigBasket service, customers should play it safe and assume that their customer info has been leaked as well. It is strongly suggested that all BigBasket users immediately change their passwords on BigBasket and at any other sites using the same password. A password manager is recommended to help you manage the unique passwords you use at different sites.

Hacker selling Twitter account data of 5.4 million users for $30k,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacker-selling-twitter-account-data-of-54-million-users-for-30k/,Lawrence Abrams,"July 22, 2022","Twitter has suffered a data breach after threat actors used a vulnerability to build a database of phone numbers and email addresses belonging to 5.4 million accounts, with the data now up for sale on a hacker forum for $30,000. Yesterday, a threat actor known as ‘devil’ said on a stolen data market that the database contains info about various accounts, including celebrities, companies, and random users. ""Hello, today I present you data collected on multiple users who use Twitter via a vulnerability. (5485636 users to be exact),"" reads the forums post selling the Twitter data. ""These users range from Celebrities, to Companies, randoms, OGs, etc."" In a conversation with the threat actor, BleepingComputer was told that they used a vulnerability to collect the data in December 2021. They are now selling the data for $30,000, and that interested buyers have already approached them. As first reported by Restore Privacy , the vulnerability used to collect the data is the same one disclosed to Twitter through HackerOne on January 1st and fixed on January 13th. ""The vulnerability allows any party without any authentication to obtain a twitter ID (which is almost equal to getting the username of an account) of any user by submitting a phone number/email even though the user has prohibitted this action in the privacy settings ,"" reads the vulnerability disclosure by security researcher 'zhirinovskiy.' ""The bug exists due to the proccess of authorization used in the Android Client of Twitter, specifically in the procces of checking the duplication of a Twitter account."" However, Devil told BleepingComputer that they are not affiliated with zhirinovskiy and have never used HackerOne. ""I don’t want to white hat in trouble who reported it on H1. I guess a lot of people are trying to connect him to me, I would be pissed if I was him. So I cant stress this enough I have nothing to do w him nor H1,"" the threat actor told BleepingComputer. The hacker told us that you could feed email addresses and phone numbers to the vulnerability to determine if it is associated with a Twitter account and retrieve that account's ID. Armed with this Twitter ID, they likely scraped the rest of the public data to create a user profile for the user. This vulnerability is similar to how threat actors scraped the Facebook account data of 533 million users in 2021. Twitter has not confirmed the data breach at this time, telling BleepingComputer that they are investigating the authenticity of the claims. ""We received a report of this incident several months ago through our bug bounty program, immediately investigated thoroughly and fixed the vulnerability. As always, we’re committed to protecting the privacy and security of the people who use Twitter. We’re grateful to the security community who engages in our bug bounty program to help us identify potential vulnerabilities such as this. We are reviewing the latest data to verify the authenticity of the claims and ensure the security of the accounts in question.” However, BleepingComputer verified with some of the Twitter users listed in a small sample of data shared by the hacker that the private information (email addresses and phone numbers) is accurate. Since we could only verify a small number of users listed in the scraped data, it is impossible to say if all 5.4 million accounts being sold are valid. Even though most of the data being sold is publicly available, threat actors can use the email addresses and phone numbers in targeted phishing attacks. Therefore, all Twitter users should be vigilant when receiving emails from Twitter, especially if they ask you to enter login credentials, which users should only be done on Twitter.com.

Welltok works with health service providers across the U.S., maintaining online wellness programs, holding databases with personal patient data, generating predictive analytics, and supporting healthcare needs like medication adherence and pandemic response. Earlier this year, the Clop ransomware gang exploited a zero-day vulnerability in the MOVEit software to breach thousands of organizations worldwide, following up with extortion demands and data leaks impacting over 77 million people . Welltok published a notice of a data incident in late October, warning that its MOVEit Transfer server was breached on July 26, 2023. This occurred despite applying the security updates as soon as those were made available by the vendor. Patient data was exposed during the breach, including full names, email addresses, physical addresses, and telephone numbers. For some, it also includes Social Security Numbers (SSNs), Medicare/Medicaid ID numbers, and certain Health Insurance information. The impact of the breach impacted institutions in various states, including Minnesota, Alabama, Kansas, North Carolina, Michigan, Nebraska, Illinois, and Massachusetts, with the following healthcare providers said to be impacted: Initial estimates about the number of impacted individuals varied as Welltok didn’t immediately disclose this information. However, earlier today, the firm reported on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services breach portal that the data breach has been confirmed to impact 8,493,379 people.

HIBP notifies 57 million people of Hot Topic data breach,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hibp-notifies-57-million-people-of-hot-topic-data-breach/#comment_form,Bill Toulas,"November 11, 2024","Have I Been Pwned warns that an alleged data breach exposed the personal information of 56,904,909 accounts for Hot Topic, Box Lunch, and Torrid customers. Hot Topic is an American retail chain specializing in counterculture-related clothing, accessories, and licensed music merchandise. The company operates over 640 stores across the United States and Canada, primarily located in shopping malls, and has a vast customer base. According to HIBP , the exposed details include full names, email addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, physical addresses, purchase history, and partial credit card data for Hot Topic, Box Lunch, and Torrid customers. The security incident was initially claimed on BreachForums by a threat actor named ""Satanic"" on October 21, 2024. The threat actor claimed to have stolen 350 million user records from Hot Topic and its related brands, Box Lunch and Torrid. ""Satanic"" was attempting to sell the database for $20,000 while also demanding a ransom payment of $100,000 from Hot Topic to remove the listing from the forums. At the time, BleepingComputer contacted Hot Topic to ask about the authenticity of the data but received no response. A report from HudsonRock published on October 23 suggested that the breach may have originated from an information stealer malware infection that stole credentials for a data unification service used by Hot Topic. While Hot Topic has remained silent, and no notifications were sent to potentially impacted customers, data analytics firm Atlas Privacy reported last week that the 730GB database actually impacts 54 million customers. Additionally, Atlas clarified that the dataset contains 25 million credit card numbers encrypted with a weak cipher that's easy to break using modern computers. Although Atlas is not 100% certain the database belongs to Hot Topic, it noted that nearly half of all email addresses were not seen in previous breaches, further supporting the legitimacy of the threat actor's claims. Altas says the breach appears to have occurred on October 19, and the data spans from 2011 until that date. The firm has set up a site that allows Hot Topic customers to check if their email address or phone number is exposed in the data leak. Meanwhile, the threat actor continues to sell the database, albeit at a lower price of $4,000. Potentially impacted Hot Topic customers should stay vigilant for phishing attacks, monitor their financial accounts closely for suspicious activity, and change their passwords on every platform where they use the same credentials. BleepingComputer has contacted Hot Topic again requesting a comment, but we have not heard back by publication time.

How SMBs can lower their risk of cyberattacks and data breaches,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/how-smbs-can-lower-their-risk-of-cyberattacks-and-data-breaches/,Home,"January 30, 2024","The Akira ransomware group is targeting small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) - 80% of its victims , since March 2023, have been SMBs. According to Arctic Wolf , the groups ransom demand ranges between $200,000 USD to over $4 million USD. If the organizations refuse to pay, the gang threatens to expose names and data. According to the same source, most intrusions leveraged compromise credentials to obtain initial access. Akira is just one example of the growing security problem for SMBs. While breaches at enterprises may grab the headlines, 56% of SMBs had cyberattacks last year. SMBs are attractive targets for cybercriminals. They typically have fewer resources like IT support, and lack robust security procedures, like employee cybersecurity training. Hackers also target SMBs to find entry points to larger enterprises. Many of the largest breaches in recent years were the result of third-party attacks that started with a smaller company that was digitally connected to another. In 2023, we’ve seen multiple breaches of SMBs that turned into large-scale attacks on major companies, including AT&T , Chic-fil-A , and 1Password . A successful breach can cause significant damage. Globally, the average cost to recover from a data breach is $4.45 million, according to IBM’s Cost of a Data Breach Report 2023 — a 15% increase over the past three years. For SMBs, the average cost of a data breach is nearly $150,000 . Indirect costs can also be significant. Breaches can undermine customer trust and damage reputations. Data may be lost forever. Even when the ransom is paid, nearly 40% of companies are unable to restore their data . Businesses should use best practices for cybersecurity, such as adopting the cybersecurity framework for SMBs developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). According to the framework, SMBs can mitigate risks by: These best practices can help reduce unauthorized access. However, 98% of cyber attacks start with some form of social engineering. If threat actors get their hands on an end-user's valid passwords, they can bypass many of these security measures. So, it is not only crucial to pay close attention to password policies, but to also block known compromised passwords. Enforcing a password policy that helps end-users create stronger passwords and blocks the use of weak and common phrases will make it more difficult for hackers. However, this must go beyond requiring basic password compliance requirements. Specops data shows that 83% of compromised passwords satisfied both length and complexity requirements of regulatory password standards. Password attacks are often successful because users are predictable. They tend to reuse passwords and use similar patterns when creating passwords and trying to meet the complexity requirements. For example, starting with a common word and then following it with a number or special character. Robust password policy enforcement can help users create easy-to-remember, but hard-to-crack passphrases. MFA reduces the risk of account takeovers by adding an additional layer of protection . Even if passwords are compromised, unauthorized users can’t access your network without the second authorization, such as a push notification sent to mobile devices or third-party identity verification providers. This helps mitigate the risk of stolen credentials and brute-force password hacking. The easiest way for cybercriminals to access networks is by using compromised credentials. At any one time, more than 24 billion user names and passwords are for sale on the dark web. You can significantly reduce your risk by blocking the use of known compromised passwords with Specops Password Policy with Breached Password Protection. Conduct password audit scans of your Active Directory with Specops Password Auditor to check end-user accounts against 950 million compromised passwords and other password related vulnerabilities. This is a free read only scan that can help your organization proactively identify password vulnerabilities in multiple reports. 88% of data breaches can be traced back to human error , according to a joint study between a Stanford University researcher and Tessian. The World Economic Forum’s Global Risk Report puts that figure at 95%. SMBs should require end-user training to help them better understand importance of following cybersecurity policies and recognizing the signs of phishing, smishing, and other attacks aimed at stealing their credentials and falling victim of ransomware. SMBs can start enhancing their security posture by protecting their frontline.

Viamedis and Almerys provide healthcare and insurance services in France with technological and administrative solutions to facilitate transactions. They manage the sensitive data of policyholders required for granting reimbursements and generally streamline the payment process in France's complex, multi-layered insurance coverage system. Viamedis first disclosed the cybersecurity incident one week ago on LinkedIn (the company's website remains down), saying that it suffered a data breach impacting beneficiaries and healthcare professionals. The company said the exposure includes names, dates of birth, insurer details, social security numbers, marital status, civil status, and guarantees open to third-party payment. No banking information, email addresses, postal details, or telephone numbers were exposed, as Viamedis said it does not store this type of data on the breached systems. The company serves 20 million insured individuals through the 84 healthcare organizations that use its services, but it opted not to disclose how many of them were impacted by the incident, saying that this is under investigation. The breach on Almerys was initially reported by local news outlets citing anonymous sources, and the firm is yet to release an official statement on the incident. However, the data protection authority in France (CNIL) has now confirmed both data breaches and says that the attacks impacted 33 million people in the country. ""The CNIL was informed by Viamedis and Almerys of the cyberattack they fell victim to at the end of January,"" reads the announcement . ""These operators, who manage the third-party payment for supplementary health insurance, saw the data necessary for their missions compromised during this breach. In total, this data leak concerns more than 33 million people."" This makes the incident one of the most impactful cyberattacks in the country's recent history, impacting nearly half its entire population. Although the exposed data does not include financial info, it is still enough to raise the risk of phishing scams, social engineering, identity theft, and insurance fraud for the exposed individuals. CNIL states that it will ensure that Viamedis and Almerys inform impacted persons directly and individually, as required by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). If you suspect you are among the impacted, it is advisable to keep a close eye on your accounts and treat incoming communications, especially solicitations concerning health insurance cost reimbursements, with suspicion. ""Although contact data was not affected by the breach, it is possible that the data involved in the breach could be combined with other information from previous data leaks,"" warns CNIL. Finally, the data protection authority announced the launch of an investigation into this incident to determine what security measures were in place for the two companies and whether GDPR obligations were met.

The breach was conducted by threat actors known as ShinyHunters, who have been behind an ongoing wave of data theft attacks targeting Salesforce customers. While Google has not shared how many individuals were impacted, ShinyHunters says the stolen information contains approximately 2.55 million data records. It is unclear if there are duplicates within these records. ShinyHunters further told BleepingComputer that they are also working with threat actors associated with ""Scattered Spider, who are responsible for first gaining initial access to targeted systems. ""Like we have said repeatedly already, ShinyHunters and Scattered Spider are one and the same,"" ShinyHunters told BleepingComputer. ""They provide us with initial access and we conduct the dump and exfiltration of the Salesforce CRM instances. Just like we did with Snowflake."" The threat actors are now referring to themselves as ""Sp1d3rHunters,"" to illustrate the overlapping group of people who are involved in these attacks. As part of these attacks, the threat actors conduct social engineering attacks against employees to gain access to credentials or trick them into linking a malicious version of Salesforce's Data Loader OAuth app to the target's Salesforce environment. The threat actors then download the entire Salesforce database and extort the companies via email, threatening to release the stolen data if a ransom is not paid. These Salesforce attacks were first reported by the Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) in June, with the company suffering the same fate a month later. Databreaches.net reported that the threat actors have already sent an extortion demand to Google . After publishing the story, ShinyHunters told BleepingComputer that they demanded 20 Bitcoins, or approximately $2.3 million, from Google to not leak the data. ""I don't care about ransoming Google anyway, I just sent them a bogus email for the lulz of it,"" said the threat actor. ShinyHunters says they have since switched to a new custom tool that makes it easier and quicker to steal data from compromised Salesforce instances. In an update, Google recently acknowledged the new tooling, stating that they have seen Python scripts used in the attacks instead of the Salesforce Data Loader.

HR giant Workday discloses data breach after Salesforce attack,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hr-giant-workday-discloses-data-breach-amid-salesforce-attacks/,Sergiu Gatlan,"August 18, 2025","Human resources giant Workday has disclosed a data breach after attackers gained access to a third-party customer relationship management (CRM) platform in a recent social engineering attack. Headquartered in Pleasanton, California, Workday has over 19,300 employees in offices across North America, EMEA, and APJ. Workday's customer list comprises over 11,000 organizations across a diverse range of industries, including more than 60% of the Fortune 500 companies. As the company revealed in a Friday blog , the attackers gained access to some of the information stored on the compromised CRM systems, adding that no customer tenants were impacted. ""We want to let you know about a recent social engineering campaign targeting many large organizations, including Workday,"" the HR giant said. ""We recently identified that Workday had been targeted and threat actors were able to access some information from our third-party CRM platform. There is no indication of access to customer tenants or the data within them."" However, some business contact information was exposed in the incident, including customer data that could be used in subsequent attacks. ""The type of information the actor obtained was primarily commonly available business contact information, like names, email addresses, and phone numbers, potentially to further their social engineering scams,"" it added. In a separate notification sent to potentially affected customers and seen by BleepingComputer, the company added that the breach was discovered almost two weeks ago, on August 6. Workday added that the attackers contact employees via text or phone, pretending to be from Human Resources or IT, in an attempt to trick them into revealing account access or personal information. A Workday spokesperson referenced the company's Friday blog post when asked to confirm that the attackers breached a Salesforce instance and described the nature of the exposed information as ""commonly available business contact information."" While the company didn't directly confirm it, BleepingComputer has learned that the Workday incident is part of a wave of security breaches linked to the ShinyHunters extortion group , which targets Salesforce CRM instances through social engineering and voice phishing attacks. Multiple other high-profile companies worldwide were also recently breached in this campaign, including Adidas , Qantas , Allianz Life , Louis Vuitton , Dior , Tiffany & Co. , Chanel , and, most recently, Google . These attacks are believed to have begun at the start of the year, with the threat actors tricking the targets' employees into linking a malicious OAuth app to their company's Salesforce instances through social engineering attacks. Once linked, the attackers use the connection to download and steal the companies' databases, with the stolen data later being used to extort the victims via email. The extortion demands were signed as coming from ShinyHunters, a notorious extortion group linked to numerous high-profile attacks over the years, including the Snowflake attacks and those against AT&T and PowerSchool .

Bed Bath & Beyond Discloses Customer Login Credentials Breach,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bed-bath-and-beyond-discloses-customer-login-credentials-breach/,Ionut Ilascu,"October 30, 2019","In a report for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday, Bed Bath & Beyond retailer disclosed that an unauthorized party obtained login information for some of its customers. Details about the breach are scarce but the company says that it affected a small number of online accounts. According to the SEC filing, email and password information was accessed from a source outside the company's systems. The amount of login information compromised as a result of this incident is limited, as the unnamed source could access less than 1% of Bed Bath & Beyond's online customer accounts. The company notes that payment card data was not affected by this incident, which is described as limited in nature. On October 29, affected customers started to receive notifications about the breach, as imposed by legal requirements. It is unclear when the incident happened, but once was discovered, the retailer contracted the services of ""a leading security forensics firm and has implemented remedial measures."" Although this security event is not expected to have a negative impact on operations and financial condition, Bed Bath & Beyond stock fell by 0.2% in after-hours trading, MarketWatch reports . Javvad Malik, Security Awareness Advocate at KnowBe4 told BleepingComputer that the source with access to the login data may have been compromised because an employee recycled their corporate credentials. Cybercriminals obtaining breach data often test it with various online services specifically because they know that many users re-use their login information. If an individual uses their company email to register to a service that gets breached, it is very likely that cybercriminals will try to use the associated password to log into the corporate account. This is not the only security incident Bed Bath & Beyond had to deal with this year. At the beginning of May, the retailer notified its customers that a call center employee processing orders ""may have attempted to illegally compromise customer credit card information.""

Avery is an American company that produces and sells self-adhesive labels, apparel branding elements, and printing services. In a data breach notification sent to impacted customers, Avery discovered they were attacked on December 9, 2024. Following an internal investigation by digital forensic experts, it was discovered that threat actors had planted a card skimmer on 'avery.com,' the company's online shop domain, on July 18, 2024. As a result, sensitive payment information customers inputted on Avery's website between July 18, 2024, and December 9, 2024, were exfiltrated to the threat actors. ""On December 9, 2024, Avery became aware of a ransomware attack relating to certain systems,"" reads the notice . ""Avery immediately launched an investigation, with the aid of forensic experts, to determine the nature and scope of the activity."" ""Our investigation determined that an unauthorized actor inserted malicious software that was used to ""scrape"" credit card information used on our website avery.com between July 18, 2024, and December 9, 2024."" The data that has been compromised as a result of this breach includes: The exposure does not include Social Security numbers, driver's license numbers, government-issued ID numbers, and dates of birth. Still, the data that has been exposed is enough to perform fraudulent transactions on the victims' names and burden their accounts with unauthorized purchases. ""We do not know if fraudulent charges are related to our website incident, but it now appears possible that payment-card (and other) information may have been acquired as we received two emails from customers who indicated that they incurred a fraudulent charge and/or phishing email,"" continued the data breach notification. ""We received a number of similar reports this month. We are therefore providing you with this notice so you can take steps to protect yourself."" According to the data breach entry on Maine's Attorney General portal, the incident impacted 61,193 Avery customers. To mitigate this risk, Avery offers 12 months of free credit monitoring service through Cyberscout. The notification recipients are also advised to be cautious of unsolicited communications and immediately report any suspicious activity on their accounts to their bank and authorities.

FanDuel warns of data breach after customer info stolen in vendor hack,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fanduel-warns-of-data-breach-after-customer-info-stolen-in-vendor-hack/,Lawrence Abrams,"January 22, 2023","The FanDuel sportsbook and betting site is warning customers that their names and email addresses were exposed in a January 2023 MailChimp security breach, urging users to remain vigilant against phishing emails. On January 13th, MailChimp confirmed they suffered a breach after hackers stole an employee's credentials using a social engineering attack. Using these credentials, the threat actors accessed an internal MailChimp customer support and administration tool to steal the ""audience data"" for 133 customers. This audience data is different for each MailChimp customer but commonly contains the email addresses and names of customers, or potential customers, that are used to send marketing emails. Last Thursday, FanDuel emailed customers to warn them that the threat actors acquired their names and email addresses during the MailChimp breach. ""Recently, we were informed by a third-party technology vendor that sends transactional emails on behalf of its clients like FanDuel that they had experienced a security breach within their system that impacted several of their clients,"" reads a FanDuel 'Notice of Third-Party Vendor Security Incident' seen by BleepingComputer. ""On Sunday evening, the vendor confirmed that FanDuel customer names and email addresses were acquired by an unauthorized actor. No customer passwords, financial account information, or other personal information was acquired in this incident."" FanDuel also stressed that this was not a breach of their systems or FanDuel user accounts and that the hackers did not acquire ""passwords, financial account information, or other personal information"" during the breach. While the security incident notification did not name the third-party vendor that was breached, FanDuel confirmed to BleepingComputer that the third-party vendor was MailChimp. FanDuel urges customers to ""remain vigilant"" against phishing attacks and attempted account takeovers after their data was exposed in this recent breach. ""Remain vigilant against email ""phishing"" attempts claiming an issue with your FanDuel account that requires providing personal or private information to resolve the problem,"" warns the FanDuel security incident email. ""FanDuel will never email customers directly and request personal information to resolve an issue."" FanDuel also warns customers to update their passwords frequently, enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) on their accounts, and not click on links in attempted password resets that a customer did not initiate. While there is no indication that the stolen MailChimp data is being used in attacks, threat actors have abused this type of stolen data in past phishing campaigns. In April 2022, a MailChimp breach allowed threat actors to steal the marketing email data for the Trezor hardware wallet. This data was then used in a phishing campaign pretending to be fake data breach notifications that pushed malicious software to steal cryptocurrency wallets. Furthermore, FanDuel accounts are in high demand, with threat actors actively performing credential-stuffing attacks to hack customers' accounts [ 1 , 2 , 3 ]. These accounts are sold on cybercrime marketplaces for as little as $2, depending on an account's balance or linked payment information. Enabling MFA on a FanDuel account using an authentication app will make it much harder for accounts to be stolen, even if a threat actor gains access to a customer's credentials. Many account compromises are caused by using the same credentials at FanDuel as other sites then suffer data breaches. Threat actors then use these credentials to attempt to log in to accounts at other sites. For this reason, using a password manager and creating unique passwords at every site is vital to prevent a breach at one company from affecting you at another.

""On February 26, 2020, Rogers became aware that one of our external service providers had inadvertently made information available online that provided access to a database managed by that service provider.

We are directly contacting any customer whose information was in the database. We sincerely apologize for this incident and regret any inconvenience this may cause,"" Rogers explained. The following customer information was exposed by this data breach: Rogers' support article states that no credit card, banking, or password information was exposed by the database. For affected customers, Rogers is providing a complimentary Transunion credit monitoring subscription. As some of the exposed information was mobile numbers, Rogers has also added port protection to the numbers to block them from being ported to another carrier without authorization. ""Some wireless account numbers were included in the vendor database. If a customer’s wireless account number was included, we added a block to their account (called port protection) to prevent their phone number from being transferred to another carrier without their authorization.

According to the notification letter shared with the U.S. Attorney General offices of Maine and California, Meyer fell victim to a cyberattack on October 25, 2021. In response, the firm launched an investigation that was concluded on December 1, 2021, revealing that threat actors gained access to personal information belonging to employees of Meyer and its subsidiaries. ""On or around December 1, 2021, our investigation identified potential unauthorized access to Meyer employee information [including employees of Meyer's subsidiaries Hestan Commercial Corporation, Hestan Smart Cooking, Hestan Vineyards, and Blue Mountain Enterprises, LLC],"" explains the Meyer data breach notification. The personal information that may have been exposed and copied by the threat actors include the following: ""Meyer takes the protection of its employees’ personal information seriously. Meyer is offering two years of identity protection services, at no cost, to affected employees and their dependents,"" concludes the data breach notification sent to impacted employees. While Meyer's announcement doesn't provide details regarding the cyberattack that resulted in the disclosed data breach, we found a relevant listing on the Conti extortion site dating to November 7, 2021. The Meyer entry on Conti's portal offers a ZIP file containing 2% of the data allegedly stolen by the ransomware gang during the cyberattack. However, the notorious ransomware group hasn’t followed up to publish the remainder 98% in the months that followed, either an indication of their willingness to negotiate indefinitely or due to losing interest. In either case, now that Meyer has gone public about the incident and offered identity protection services to the affected individuals, there can be no resolution that benefits the malicious actors.

The organization is Oklahoma's largest not-for-profit healthcare network, operating hospitals, clinics, and emergency care units across the state. On December 26, 2023, the organization confirmed it suffered a cyberattack after patients started receiving extortion emails informing that their sensitive personal information. Unless Integris Health met the attacker's demands, the stolen data would be sold to other cybercriminals on January 5, 2024. The threat actor told BleepingComputer that their attack did not involve encryption and they only stole the data. This did not cause any network interruption and allowed Integris Health to keep providing its services to patients. The emails the patients received from the threat actor contained accurate information and linked to a website in the Tor network hosting the stolen details, but access was not free. Visitors could pay $50 and trust the attacker's word on removing the details, or pay $3 to view information belonging to any other impacted individual. Integris published last week a notification confirming that the incident impacted patient data, which included the following details: The organization clarified that the leaked data did not involve employment information, driver's licenses, account credentials (usernames and passwords), or financial information. Talking to BleepingComputer, the threat actor said that they are selling on a dark web marketplace data for 2.3 million Integris patients (based on the number of social security numbers in the database). In a new entry today, the U.S. Department of HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) portal shows that the number of impacted Integris Health patients is 2,385,646 . Integris Health says all affected patients will receive individual notifications, and recipients should remain vigilant to spot and report identity theft and fraud attempts early. The organization has published a FAQ in the form of a PDF where victims can find some additional information regarding the incident, how it impacts them, and what protective steps they can take. It is worth noting that the deadline the threat actor set for Integris Health to pay a ransom has long passed and it is very likely that the stolen data has been sold or share with other cybercriminals, who could use it for various scams, phishing, or other types of attacks.

In May 2019, Evite posted a data incident notice that disclosed an unauthorized third-party had gained access to their servers starting on February 22, 2019 and were able to access member's personal data. No financial information or social security numbers, though, were part of the breach. ""Potentially affected information could include names, usernames, email addresses, passwords, and, if optionally provided to us, dates of birth, phone numbers, and mailing addresses."" At the time, it was thought that approximately 10 million users had their information exposed as an Evite database with that amount was being sold on an online underground marketplace by a person named ""gnosticplayers"". This same person was also involved in selling various large collections of data breaches. According to a database received by Have I Been Pwned , the amount of exposed users is allegedly much larger. HIBP states that the database they received consists of 100,985,047 unique Evite users, with the data exposed being the same as what was disclosed in the original breach notification. ""In April 2019, the social planning website for managing online invitations Evite identified a data breach of their systems . Upon investigation, they found unauthorised access to a database archive dating back to 2013.

Members of the service also had names, phone numbers, physical addresses, dates of birth, genders and passwords stored in plain text exposed. The data was provided to HIBP by a source who requested it be attributed to ""JimScott.Sec@protonmail.com""."" The original leaked database was being sold on the online underground market named Dream Market. This site has since been shut down, so it is not currently known where or if this larger Evite database is being sold online as well. Due to the large amount of exposed users, anyone who has an Evite account is advised to change their password.

The computer maker began emailing data breach notifications to customers yesterday, stating that a Dell portal containing customer information related to purchases was breached. ""We are currently investigating an incident involving a Dell portal, which contains a database with limited types of customer information related to purchases from Dell,"" reads a Dell data breach notification shared with BleepingComputer. ""We believe there is not a significant risk to our customers given the type of information involved."" Dell states that the following information was accessed by the threat actor during the breach: The company stresses that the stolen information does not include financial or payment information, email addresses, or telephone numbers and that they are working with law enforcement and a third-party forensics firm to investigate the incident. BleepingComputer contacted Dell on Wednesday to learn more about the breach and how many people it impacted but was told they ""are not disclosing this specific information from our ongoing investigation."" As first reported by Daily Dark Web , a threat actor named Menelik attempted to sell a Dell database on the Breach Forums hacking forum on April 28th. The threat actor said they stole data from the computer maker for ""49 million customer and other information systems purchased from Dell between 2017-2024."" While BleepingComputer has not been able to confirm if this is the same data that Dell disclosed, it matches the information listed in the data breach notification. The Breach Forum's post has since been deleted from the site, which could indicate that another threat actor purchased the database. Dell does not ""believe there is significant risk to our customers given the type of information involved,"" yet the stolen information could potentially be used in targeted attacks against Dell customers. As the stolen information does not include email addresses, threat actors could target specific people with physical mailings with phishing links or that contain media (DVDs/thumb drives) to install malware on targets' devices. While this may sound far-fetched, threat actors have conducted similar attacks in the past, physically mailing tampered Ledger hardware wallets that stole cryptocurrency or sending gifts with USB drives that installed malware . As the database is no longer being sold, there is a good chance a threat actor is attempting to monetize it in some way through attacks. Therefore, be wary of any physical mailings or emails you receive that claim to be from Dell asking you to install software, change passwords, or perform some other potentially risky action. If you receive an email or physical mailing, you should instead contact Dell directly to confirm it is legitimate.

"Ransomware gang leaks data from Stanford, Maryland universities",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gang-leaks-data-from-stanford-maryland-universities/#comment_form,Sergiu Gatlan,"April 3, 2021","Personal and financial information stolen from Stanford Medicine, University of Maryland Baltimore (UMB), and the University of California was leaked online by the Clop ransomware group. The threat actors obtained the documents after hacking the universities' Accellion File Transfer Appliance (FTA) software used to share and store sensitive information. Data stolen in the attack targeting Stanford Medicine's Accellion server includes names, addresses, email addresses, Social Security numbers, and financial information, reported the Stanford Daily . ""We discovered the breach earlier this week when the hackers posted evidence that they had accessed a limited number of files in our system containing some personally identifiable information,"" UMB also told DataBreaches.net . ""UC has learned that it, along with other universities, government agencies, and private companies throughout the country, was recently subject to a cybersecurity attack,"" a statement issued by the UC Office of the President reads. ""The attack involves the use of Accellion, a vendor used by many organizations for secure file transfer, in which an unauthorized individual appears to have copied and transferred UC files by exploiting a vulnerability in Accellion's file-transfer service."" Since February, the ransomware operation has been leaking files stolen after compromising vulnerable Accellion FTA file-sharing servers. The ransomware gang started leaking the universities' data during late March, attempting to coerce them to pay ransoms to have the stolen data deleted and the leaks stopped. Last month, the Clop ransomware gang leaked other data sets allegedly stolen from the University of Colorado and the University of Miami . The attackers haven't gained access to universities' internal networks, with the incident only impacting their Accellion servers. While still unclear if Clop is behind these Accellion attacks or they're collaborating with another group, a joint statement from Mandiant and Accellion shed more light on these attacks also linking them to a second operation, the FIN11 cybercrime group. BleepingComputer has reported multiple data breaches affecting companies and organizations after these threat actors successfully compromised their Accellion FTA servers and exfiltrated sensitive information. Starting with January, we reported attacks on energy giant Shell , cybersecurity firm Qualys , supermarket giant Kroger , the Reserve Bank of New Zealand , Singtel, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) , the Office of the Washington State Auditor (""SAO""), as well as multiple universities and other organizations. Five Eyes members also issued a joint security advisory in February about ongoing attacks and extortion attempts targeting orgs that use vulnerable Accellion File Transfer Appliance (FTA) versions. In related news, Brown University, a private Ivy League research university, is still working on bringing systems online after it had to disable them following a cyberattack on Tuesday.

Fintech giant Finastra notifies victims of October data breach,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fintech-giant-finastra-notifies-victims-of-october-data-breach/,Sergiu Gatlan,"February 17, 2025","Financial technology giant Finastra is notifying victims of a data breach after their personal information was stolen by unknown attackers who first breached its systems in October 2024. London-based Finastra provides financial services software applications to more than 8,100 financial institutions across 130 countries, including 45 of the world's top 50 banks. As the company warned in breach notification letters sent to those impacted by the breach, the security incident was first detected on November 7 after Finastra identified malicious activity on some of its systems. ""Our investigation revealed that an unauthorized third party accessed a Secure File Transfer Platform (SFTP) at various times between October 31, 2024 and November 8, 2024. Findings from the investigation indicate that on October 31, 2024, the unauthorized third party obtained certain files from the SFTP,"" the fintech giant said. ""Finastra has no indication the unauthorized third party further copied, retained, or shared any of the data. We have no reason to suspect your information has or will be misused. As a result, we believe the risk to individuals whose personal data was involved is low."" While Finastra has yet to share the number of individuals affected by the data breach and the nature of the exposed data (besides victims' names), the company started sending breach notification letters last week to at least 65 people in the state whose financial account information was stolen (according to filings with the Attorney General's office in Massachusetts). The financial services company also provides two years of free credit monitoring and identity restoration services through Experian to those whose information was exposed or stolen in the attack. Although Finastra disclosed very limited information in filings with Attorney General offices, the breach is believed to be linked to a (now-deleted) post made by a threat actor known as ""abyss0"" on the BreachForums online cybercrime community claiming to sell 400GB of data allegedly stolen from Finastra's network . ​When BleepingComputer asked about the forum post in November, a Finastra spokesperson would neither confirm nor deny if the data belonged to the company, only saying that they had suffered a limited-scope security breach and were evaluating its impact. ""On November 7, 2024 Finastra's Security Operations Center (SOC) detected suspicious activity related to an internally hosted Secure File Transfer Platform (SFTP) we use to send files to certain customers,"" Finastra told BleepingComputer. Finastra was also forced to take some of its systems offline in March 2020 to contain what Tom Kilroy, the company's Chief Operating Officer at the time, described as a ransomware attack. While the company didn't share how the attackers gained access to its systems, cyber threat intelligence firm Bad Packets found that Finastra had multiple Pulse Secure VPN and Citrix ADC (NetScaler) unpatched servers before the attack. A Finastra spokesperson was not immediately available for comment when contacted by BleepingComputer earlier today to provide more details on the October 2024 data breach. It's budget season!

"200,000 North Face accounts hacked in credential stuffing attack",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/200-000-north-face-accounts-hacked-in-credential-stuffing-attack/,Bill Toulas,"September 7, 2022","Outdoor apparel brand 'The North Face' was targeted in a large-scale credential stuffing attack that has resulted in the hacking of 194,905 accounts on the thenorthface.com website. A credential stuffing attack is when threat actors use email addresses/usernames and password combinations obtained from data breaches to attempt to hack into user accounts on other websites. The success of these attacks relies on the practice of password recycling, where a person uses the same credentials across multiple online platforms. The credential stuffing attack on The North Face website began on July 26, 2022, but the website's administrators detected the unusual activity on August 11, 2022, and were able to stop it on August 19, 2022. After investigating the attack, North Face determined that the attackers managed to breach close to 200,000 accounts using valid credentials, potentially accessing the following customer information: Payment details like credit card data are not stored on the website, so the attackers could not access sensitive financial information. ""We do not keep a copy of payment card details on thenorthface.com. We only retain a ""token"" linked to your payment card, and only our third-party payment card processor keeps payment card details,"" explains the firm in the breach notification. ""The token cannot be used to initiate a purchase anywhere other than on thenorthface.com."" In response to the security incident, the brand's parent firm, VF Corporation (formerly Vanity Fair Mills), is sending notices of data breach to impacted customers. Additionally, all user passwords have been reset, and all payment card tokens on accounts accessed by unauthorized intruders were wiped. Hence, impacted customers with an account on the website will have to enter a new password and re-enter their payment card details to make a purchase. Of course, affected users are expected to pick a unique, strong (long) password and avoid the comfort of recycling credentials. Also, if the customers use the same passwords on other online platforms, those should be changed immediately to avoid additional compromises. Notably, this is the second time The North Face reset passwords following a successful credential stuffing attack, with the previous one dating back to November 2020 . VF Corporation owns several successful brands besides The North Face, like Vans, Timberland, Eastpak, Kipling, Dickies, and Napapijri. However, those don't appear to have been impacted by this or similar attacks.

University of Manchester says hackers ‘likely’ stole data in cyberattack,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/university-of-manchester-says-hackers-likely-stole-data-in-cyberattack/,Bill Toulas,"June 9, 2023","The University of Manchester warns staff and students that they suffered a cyberattack where threat actors likely stole data from the University's network. The University is a public research institute and one of the UK's largest and most successful education and research hubs, with over 10,000 staff and 45,000 students. In a statement published on its website, the University of Manchester says they discovered the breach on Tuesday, June 6th, and immediately launched an investigation. ""Regrettably, I have to share with you the news that the University is the victim of a cyber incident,"" reads the statement on the University's website. ""It has been confirmed that some of our systems have been accessed by an unauthorised party and data have likely been copied."" The announcement further informs that in-house experts and external support are working non-stop to remediate the situation, determine exactly which systems have been accessed, and work toward a timely system restoration. The University says they informed all relevant authorities, including the Information Commissioner's Office, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), and the National Crime Agency, about the security and data breach. ""We know this will cause concern to members of our community and we are very sorry for this. Our priority is to resolve this issue and provide information to those affected as soon as we are able to, and we are focusing all available resources,"" apologized The University of Manchester. The University has set up a separate FAQ page for the ""cyber incident,"" primarily devoted to hosting security guidance for students and staff members. Currently, the University's members aren't required to reset their passwords, but high vigilance against potential phishing attacks is advised. On the topics of who is responsible for the attack and whether any sensitive research or personal data has been stolen, the University was limited to saying that the investigation is still ongoing and will inform the public as soon as more information becomes available. Furthermore, the University of Manchester says its security incident is unrelated to the recent MOVEit Transfer data theft attacks or the associated data breach at Zellis. While the University's statements do not provide any further details on the attack, BleepingComputer has learned from sources that it was ransomware. However, we have not been able to confirm this independently, and the University's spokesperson has declined to comment on the topic when asked by BleepingComputer. It's budget season!

"Arbonne MLM data breach exposes user passwords, personal info",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/arbonne-mlm-data-breach-exposes-user-passwords-personal-info/,Sergiu Gatlan,"May 26, 2020","International multi-level marketing (MLM) firm Arbonne International exposed the personal information and credentials of thousands after its internal systems were breached by an unauthorized party last month. Arbonne is a privately held California-based company acquired by Groupe Rocher in 2018 , with annual revenues of over $500 million and a network of more than 200,000 independent consultants from the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Poland, and New Zealand. ""On the evening of April 20, 2020, Arbonne became aware of unusual activity within a limited number of its internal systems,"" Arbonne says in a data breach notification letter filed with the Office of the Attorney General of California. ""On April 23, 2020, the investigation identified a data table containing limited personal information that may have been accessible to unauthorized actor."" According to Arbonne's breach notification, 3,527 California residents were impacted in the incident, with the following types of personal information being exposed to unauthorized access: names, email and mailing addresses, order purchase histories, phone numbers, and Arbonne account passwords. While the company shared the number of affected Californians, the total number of impacted individuals is currently unknown although Maryland, New York, New Mexico, North Carolina, and Rhode Island residents are advised to contact their Attorney General for more info. BleepingComputer has reached out to Arbonne for more details but had not heard back at the time of this publication. This article will be updated when a response is received. Arbonne says that the affected users' payment card or government ID information, such as Social Security numbers, was not exposed in the breach based on the ongoing investigation's results ""While our investigation is ongoing, in an abundance of caution, we forced a password reset for all users whose passwords may have been subject to unauthorized access and we notified these users to ensure they were aware of this incident,"" Arbonne added. The data breach experienced by the MLM company was also reported to the FBI and relevant regulators. Following the incident, Arbonne provides all impacted individuals with twelve months of free credit monitoring, fraud consultation, and identity theft restoration services from Kroll. The company also provides a customer service support hotline at 800-ARBONNE, open ""Monday through Friday, 7 am – 8 pm Pacificexcluding national holidays."" Last month, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission warned Arbonne to direct its independent consultants to stop making claims on social media that some of its products ""treat or prevent Coronavirus Disease 2019 ('COVID-19').""

Data breach broker selling user records stolen from 26 companies,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/data-breach-broker-selling-user-records-stolen-from-26-companies/,Lawrence Abrams,"December 31, 2020","A data breach broker is selling the allegedly stolen user records for twenty-six companies on a hacker forum, BleepingComputer has learned. When threat actors and hacking groups breach a company and steal their user databases, they commonly work with data breach brokers who market and sell the data for them. Brokers will then create posts on hacker forums and dark web marketplaces to market the stolen data. Last Friday, a data broker began selling the combined total of 368.8 million stolen user records for twenty-six companies on a hacker forum. Of these twenty-six companies, only eight are new alleged data breaches that have not been previously disclosed. These seven companies are Teespring.com, MyON.com, Chqbook.com, Anyvan.com, Eventials.com, Wahoofitness.com, Sitepoint.com, and ClickIndia.com. In a conversation with the data broker, BleepingComputer was told that Teespring is being sold for $3,800-$4,000, MyON for $2,800, and Chqbook for $1,800. The broker has not decided on pricing for the other databases. The full list of companies whose alleged data is being sold, including the number of user records and whether they were previously disclosed, is listed below. After learning about this forum post, BleepingComputer reached out to the companies that have not been previously disclosed in the past. MyON confirmed that their systems was breached but stated that student's private data was not exposed. ""In July 2020 we were made aware of a bad actor trying to sell portions of our data on the dark web. We immediately began investigating to shut down any continued threats to our data or the data of our customers. We were then able to confirm that according to federal and state privacy laws, no confidential student or customer data was compromised, and this incident did not rise to the level of an actual breach of student private data."" ""We are committed to the protection of the privacy of our user’s and customer’s data and have instituted supplemental protections in addition to our standard information security measures. Additional information about those efforts is outlined in our information Security Overview and our online Privacy Hub at https://www.renaissance.com/privacy/,"" MyON told BleepingComputer via email. From the samples seen of the MyON data breach, the exposed information consisted of login names, BCrypt hashed passwords, and names. In an email to BleepingComputer, Chqbook.com claims that they were not breached. ""There has been no data breach and no information belonging to our customers has been compromised. Data security is a key priority area for us and we conduct periodic security audits to ensure the safety of our customers’ information,"" Chqbook told BleepingComputer. BleepingComputer has emailed some of the users listed in the Chqbook sample to confirm if the data belongs to them. BleepingComputer contacted TeeSpring on December 27th, after finding out about the breach, and was told they were investigating it. After further attempts to contact them about the breach, they refused to reply to our emails. We learned later that they had already disclosed the data breach notification on December 1st, but included a noindex HTML tag that prevented the advisory from being indexed by search engines. We can't be sure if the TeeSpring stolen data was used maliciously but we have already received reports of phishing emails reaching Teespring users' mailboxes. Other than MyON and Chqbook's statements, it has not been confirmed if the other six companies have suffered a data breach. Historically, sold data breaches like this tend to be legitimate, and companies soon disclose them after the new becomes public. For now, if you have an account at any of the sites listed above, it is strongly suggested that you change your password to a strong and unique one used only at that site. If the same password has been used at other sites, change your password to a unique one there as well. BleepingComputer recommends using a password manager to keep track of strong and unique passwords at sites you have accounts.
